      "title": "Running Your Expo App on a Real Device for Testing",
      "content": "<p>As an Expo developer, you\u2019ve likely spent countless hours running your app on a simulator or emulator. While that's great for most development, nothing beats the feel of your app on a real device. It's the only way to truly test performance, native features, and user experience.</p>\n\n<p>There are two primary paths for running your Expo app on a physical device: using the <strong>Expo Go</strong> app or building a <strong>custom development client</strong>. The right choice depends on your project's dependencies.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Method 1: The Fast Path with Expo Go\n</h3>\n\n<p>If your project relies only on the standard APIs that come with the Expo SDK\u2014meaning no custom native modules or libraries outside of what Expo Go supports\u2014this is your go-to method. It\u2019s quick and requires minimal setup.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Prerequisites\n</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your Device: An iPhone or Android phone.</li>\n<li>Expo Go: Make sure the free <strong>Expo Go</strong> app is installed on your device from the App Store or Google Play Store.</li>\n<li>Shared Network: This is the most critical step. Your computer and your mobile device must be connected to the exact same Wi-Fi network. Issues with corporate or university networks that have client isolation are the most common cause of connection failures.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Guide\n</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Start Your Development Server: In your project's root directory, open your terminal and run the command <code>npx expo start</code>.</li>\n<li> Scan the QR Code: The terminal will display a QR code. Use your device to scan it.\n\n<ul>\n<li>On iOS: Open the built-in Camera app and point it at the QR code. A notification will pop up. Tap it to open your app in Expo Go.</li>\n<li>On Android: Open the Expo Go app and tap the \"Scan QR Code\" button to use the in-app scanner.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Run the App: Expo Go will connect to your computer, download the JavaScript bundle, and run your app. Now, whenever you save changes in your code, they'll instantly update on your device.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Accessing the Developer Menu\n</h4>\n\n<p>Once the app is running, you can access the developer menu for debugging tools by shaking your device firmly. This menu allows you to open a remote debugger, reload the app, or view a performance monitor.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  Method 2: The Professional Path with a Development Build\n</h3>\n\n<p>Once you add custom native modules\u2014such as a specific video player, a payment library, or Firebase\u2014the Expo Go app won't work anymore. Its core is immutable and doesn't contain the native code your new library needs. The solution is to create a custom development build, which is a personalized version of Expo Go with your project's unique native code compiled in.</p>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Prerequisites\n</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Expo Account: You'll need a free Expo account.</li>\n<li>EAS CLI: Install the Expo Application Services (EAS) command-line interface by running <code>npm install -g eas-cli</code> and then log in with <code>eas login</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>\n  \n  \n  Step-by-Step Guide\n</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li> Add the Development Client Library: This library allows your custom-built app to communicate with your development server. Run <code>npx expo install expo-dev-client</code>.</li>\n<li> Configure the Build Profile: Make sure your <code>eas.json</code> file is configured with a <code>development</code> build profile that has <code>\"developmentClient\": true</code>. If you don't have this file, you can generate it by running <code>eas build:configure</code>.</li>\n<li> Create the Development Build: This is the process of building the native <code>.apk</code> (Android) or <code>.ipa</code> (iOS) file. It's done on Expo's cloud servers and can take 10-20 minutes.\n\n<ul>\n<li>For Android: <code>eas build --profile development --platform android</code>\n</li>\n<li>For iOS: <code>eas build --profile development --platform ios</code> (Note: This requires a paid Apple Developer account.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Install the Build: Once the build is complete, EAS will provide a link and a QR code. Scan the QR code to download and install the app on your device. On iOS, you'll likely use TestFlight for this.</li>\n<li> Run Your App:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Start your server with <code>npx expo start --dev-client</code>.</li>\n<li>Open the new custom app you just installed on your phone. It will automatically connect to your development server.</li>\n<li>Just like with Expo Go, you can shake your device to access the developer menu and debugging tools.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  When to Rebuild Your App\n</h3>\n\n<p>With a development build, you don't need to rebuild every time you make a change. Your JavaScript code is loaded dynamically from the development server, providing a fast and iterative experience.</p>\n\n<p>You must create a new build only when you change the native code. This includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Adding or removing a native module npm package.</li>\n<li>Upgrading or downgrading an existing native module.</li>\n<li>Changing native configuration files like <code>app.json</code>, <code>Info.plist</code>, or <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> (e.g., updating your app icon or package name).</li>\n<li>Upgrading your project to a new Expo SDK version.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For everything else\u2014like editing your JavaScript/TypeScript files or changing CSS styles\u2014the Metro server will instantly push the updates to your running app.</p>\n\n<p>This two-path approach makes Expo incredibly flexible, allowing you to choose the right workflow for your project at every stage of development.</p>",

The answer lies in <strong>signal processing</strong> the art of converting an analog signal into a digital one.</p>\n\n<p>In this post, I\u2019ll walk you through a simple MATLAB simulation where I generate an analog sine wave, sample it, quantize it, and finally encode it into binary form.

      "content": "<p><strong>TLDR;</strong><br />\nYour cloud bill is out of control because traditional architectures are wasteful in a pay-as-you-go world. To fix it, adopt three key architectural patterns:<br />\n<strong>Serverless:</strong> Stop paying for idle servers. Only pay for the exact compute time your code is running.<br />\n<strong>Auto-Scaling:</strong> Automatically scale your resources up and down with traffic. Pay only for what you need, right when you need it.<br />\n<strong>Compute Consolidation:</strong> Use containers (like Kubernetes) to pack your applications more densely onto fewer servers, maximizing utilization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The catch:</strong> These aren\u2019t magic bullets. Applying them incorrectly can add complexity and cost. Treat cost as a core design principle from the start, not an afterthought.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Why Your Cloud Bill Gives You Nightmares (and How to Fix It!)\n</h2>\n\n<p>An email indicates an increase in your OpEx. The one with the subject line that just says \u201cCloud Spend.\u201d It\u2019s a modern-day horror story for tech leaders, and if you\u2019re living it, you\u2019re not alone. The cloud, once hailed as the economic savior of IT, can quickly become a financial black hole if left unchecked..</p>\n\n<p>Cloud environments are the ultimate developer\u2019s playground, a Swiss Army knife of services ready for any challenge. But this power has a dark side. Unchecked, it drains budgets with ruthless efficiency. It\u2019s like being handed the keys to a supercar with a bottomless gas tank \u2014 thrilling, but ruthlessly expensive if you keep the pedal to the metal 24/7. The agility you crave from the cloud demands architectural discipline.</p>\n\n<p>But there\u2019s good news. This isn\u2019t an unsolvable problem. There are proven and tested architectural patterns \u2014 designed to impose order to the chaos. These aren\u2019t abstract theories; they are practically proven &amp; tested patterns that engineers have implemented time and time again winning the battle against cloud costs.</p>\n\n<p>I will be sharing three heavyweight patterns that will tame the cost beast, trim the fat from your expenses, and restore peace with the folks in accounting. Consider this your guide to taming the cloud cost beast.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  A Quick Trip Down Memory Lane: From Ancient Stones to Modern Servers\n</h2>\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be clear: worrying about budgets isn\u2019t some new-age tech delima. It\u2019s as old as civilization itself. The folks building the pyramids didn\u2019t have an unlimited supply of giant rocks or labor. Every decision was a trade-off, a calculated move to maximize output and minimize waste. Fast forward through the industrial revolution, and the same principles of resource allocation and relentless optimization built railroads and factories. The game hasn\u2019t changed, only the playing field.</p>\n\n<p>Remember the days of buying massive servers, praying you provisioned enough capacity, and letting them sit idle most of the time? A monument to potential, gathering dust in a dimly lit server room. Costs were largely fixed, baked into the capital expenditure budget, but often incredibly inefficient. Over-provisioning was the name of the game, a safety net against the unknown demands of the future. It was a world of fixed costs and limited agility.</p>\n\n<p>The move to the cloud revolutionized everything with its \u201cpay-per-use\u201d model. The shift from CapEx to OpEx was big. While empowering, it also meant every inefficient design choice now has a direct, real-time financial consequence. A poorly optimized query, a server idling in the digital ether \u2014 all translated directly into dollars and cents. This big shift demanded new architectural thinking centered on continuous cost optimization.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Big Three: Your Cost-Cutting Friends!\n</h2>\n\n<p>Ready to make your infrastructure work smarter, not just harder? Here are three architectural patterns that deliver serious bang for your buck.<br />\n<strong>Pattern 1: Serverless Architectures \u2014 The \u201cPay-Per-Sip\u201d Model</strong><br />\n<strong>What it is:</strong> Imagine writing code and letting the cloud provider handle all the server magic. You only pay for the exact compute time your code runs, not for idle servers waiting around. It\u2019s akin to a metered tap; you pay only for the water you consume. Think AWS Lambda, Azure Functions. The very essence of serverless is abstraction, delegating the complexities of infrastructure management to the cloud provider.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why it\u2019s a Money Saver:</strong> Eliminates costs associated with unused capacity. Ideal for applications with unpredictable or infrequent traffic (e.g., event-driven processing, API endpoints). You only pay when the tap is running, not for the whole water pipe! It allows you to focus on your business logic, not the plumbing that supports it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pattern 2: Auto-Scaling and Elasticity \u2014 The \u201cJust Right\u201d Principle</strong><br />\n<strong>What it is:</strong> Your application resources are dynamically adjusted (like adding or removing virtual machines or database capacity) in real-time based on actual demand. Traffic surge? Scale up! Midnight lull? Scale down, perhaps even to zero! It\u2019s a dynamic equilibrium, a constant dance between demand and supply. (e.g., AWS EC2 Auto Scaling, Elastic Load Balancing).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why it\u2019s a Money Saver:</strong> Prevents wasteful over-provisioning. Ensures you\u2019re only paying for the resources you actively need at that moment. It\u2019s like a smart thermostat for your IT infrastructure, perfectly matching energy use to demand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pattern 3: Compute Resource Consolidation \u2014 The \u201cShared Ride\u201d to Efficiency</strong><br />\n<strong>What it is:</strong> Maximizing the utilization of your existing compute resources by packing more into less. This means running multiple applications or components on shared infrastructure, often leveraging technologies like container orchestrators (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm). It\u2019s about efficient packing, making the most of the available space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why it\u2019s a Money Saver:</strong> Increases density and reduces unused provisioned capacity. Instead of everyone driving their own car to work, you\u2019re all carpooling, cutting down on individual costs and making the most of each vehicle. Containerization allows for a level of resource granularity that was previously unimaginable.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Dark Side of Cost Control: When Good Intentions Go Bad (and Hidden Costs Strike Back!)\n</h2>\n\n<p>Not every cost-saving pattern is a silver bullet. Sometimes, trying to save money can ironically lead to more expense. The road to cost optimization is paved with good intentions, but also with potential pitfalls.</p>\n\n<p>Adopting complex patterns (like microservices for a tiny app) just because they\u2019re trendy, not because they\u2019re truly necessary. This adds unnecessary complexity, development time, and higher maintenance costs in the long run. It\u2019s like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p>\n\n<p>Focusing only on \u201cdoes it work?\u201d and forgetting \u201cis it cheap?\u201d, \u201cis it fast?\u201d, or \u201cis it secure?\u201d Cost isn\u2019t an afterthought; it needs to be a core design principle from day one. These non-functional requirements are often overlooked, only to surface later in the development lifecycle.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Rework Ruckus:</strong> Fixing architectural blunders later in the development cycle is always exponentially more expensive. The further down the line an issue is discovered, the more costly it becomes to rectify.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> While patterns aim for efficiency, managing a highly distributed or serverless system can introduce operational complexity, requiring more skilled (and expensive!) staff. The elegance of the architecture must be balanced against the practicalities of managing it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vendor Lock-in:</strong> Over-reliance on proprietary cloud services can save money initially, but make future migration or multi-cloud strategies prohibitively expensive. Be wary of the golden handcuffs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Scope Creep:</strong> The project quietly expands beyond its initial boundaries without corresponding budget adjustments, leading to inevitable overruns. The insidious creep of features can quickly derail even the best-laid plans.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Don\u2019t just implement a pattern, understand its implications, its fit for your context, and continuously monitor its real-world impact on costs. Data-driven decision-making is paramount.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Peering into the Crystal Ball: The Future of Frugal Architecture\n</h2>\n\n<p>Get ready for AI and Machine Learning to become your ultimate cost-control sidekicks. They\u2019ll predict future costs, optimize resource allocation in real-time, and even help design more efficient systems automatically. The algorithms are coming, and they\u2019re hungry for inefficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Expect even more sophisticated tools that automate resource management, coupled with unparalleled visibility into every dollar spent. FinOps (the collaboration between finance, engineering, and business) will become even more ingrained, creating a continuous feedback loop for cost optimization. The walls between departments will crumble, replaced by a shared understanding of cost and value.</p>\n\n<p>Cost control will increasingly intertwine with environmental responsibility. Designing systems that are energy-efficient, use fewer resources, and reduce digital waste will become a primary driver, offering both financial savings and a greener footprint. Sustainability will no longer be a niche concern, but a fundamental design principle.</p>\n\n<p>The era of reactive cost-cutting is fading. Future architectures will be designed with cost efficiency as a foundational principle, continuously monitored, and incrementally optimized throughout their entire lifecycle. Proactive, not reactive, will be the mantra of the future.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Conclusion: Build Smart, Spend Less (and Sleep Better!)\n</h2>\n\n<p>Serverless, Auto-Scaling &amp; Elasticity, and Compute Resource Consolidation are powerful patterns for keeping your cloud spending in check.</p>\n\n<p>Cost control isn\u2019t just about being cheap; it\u2019s about maximizing value, building resilient and performant systems, and ensuring your technology investments directly support your business goals. It\u2019s about aligning technology with business strategy.</p>\n\n<p>Start by auditing your current architecture. Where can these patterns be applied? What hidden costs can you uncover and eliminate? The journey to a leaner, meaner, more cost-effective operation begins now!</p>\n\n<p>Share your thoughts in the comments! What architectural patterns have saved your company money? Let\u2019s learn from each other\u2019s experiences.</p>",

This is primarily due to EF Core's change tracking and additional abstractions. <br />\nDEV Community</p>\n\n<p>Single Record Updates: Dapper executes updates faster, averaging 169.2 microseconds, compared to EF Core's 209.1 microseconds. Additionally, EF Core consumes about 16.67 times more memory due to its internal mechanisms. <br />\nTrailhead Technology Partners</p>\n\n<p>Bulk Operations: For bulk inserts, Dapper demonstrates superior scalability. While EF Core is marginally faster for smaller datasets, Dapper maintains consistent performance as the dataset size grows. <br />\nTrailhead Technology Partners</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udde0 Memory Usage</p>\n\n<p>Memory consumption is a critical factor in performance:</p>\n\n<p>Single Insert: Dapper uses approximately 18.23 KB, whereas EF Core uses about 39.09 KB.</p>\n\n<p>Bulk Insert (30 records): Dapper uses around 427.73 KB, while EF Core uses approximately 753.61 KB.</p>\n\n<p>These figures underscore Dapper's efficiency in memory management. <br />\nTrailhead Technology Partners</p>\n\n<h3>\n  \n  \n  \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Feature Comparison\n</h3>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th>Dapper</th>\n<th>EF Core</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Abstraction Level</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Performance</td>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Memory Usage</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>Higher</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ease of Use</td>\n<td>Requires SQL knowledge</td>\n<td>LINQ support, migrations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Change Tracking</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Migrations</td>\n<td>No</td>\n<td>Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ideal Use Case</td>\n<td>High-performance scenarios</td>\n<td>Complex data models, enterprise</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n\n<p>\ud83e\udde9 When to Use Which?</p>\n\n<p>Choose Dapper: For applications requiring high performance, minimal overhead, and fine-grained control over SQL queries. It's particularly suitable for microservices, high-load applications, and scenarios where raw SQL execution is paramount.</p>\n\n<p>Choose EF Core: For applications with complex data models, where features like change tracking, migrations, and LINQ support are beneficial. It's ideal for enterprise-level applications where developer productivity and maintainability are priorities.</p>\n\n<p>\ud83e\uddea Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds</p>\n\n<p>In many real-world scenarios, a hybrid approach can be advantageous:</p>\n\n<p>Use EF Core: For standard CRUD operations, data modeling, and scenarios where its features enhance productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Use Dapper: For performance-critical queries, bulk operations, and scenarios requiring optimized SQL execution.</p>\n\n<p>By leveraging both frameworks appropriately, developers can achieve a balance between performance and productivity. <br />\nDEV Community</p>\n\n<p>\ud83c\udfc1 Conclusion</p>\n\n<p>Both Dapper and EF Core have their strengths and are suitable for different use cases. Dapper excels in performance and control, making it ideal for high-performance scenarios. EF Core offers a rich set of features that enhance developer productivity, making it suitable for complex applications. The choice between the two should be guided by the specific requirements of your project.</p>",

Data is a JSON file; favorites persist via localStorage. Search is client-side; queries are linkable with ?q= and you can filter favorites with fav=1. Dangerous commands show a confirm before copying. Headers (HSTS, nosniff) + sitemap/robots are set.<p>Planned next: more commands/recipes (docker, systemctl, networking), offline PWA, and a simple import/export for favorites.<p>Suggest a missing command: <a href=\"https://www.greppers.com/submit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.greppers.com/submit.html</a><p>I\u2019m looking for gaps and better real-world examples.
