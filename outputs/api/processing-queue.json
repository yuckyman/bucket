      "title": "From adolescence to old age: how sensory precision shapes body ownership during physiological aging",
      "content": "Body ownership relies on the integration of multisensory signals coming from the environment and the body itself. Considering the substantial neurophysiological and sensory modifications occurring across the lifespan, this study aims to quantitatively evaluate age-related changes in hand ownership and its underlying bottom-up sensory and top-down components from adolescence to advanced aging. Ninety-two healthy women aged 15\u201383 underwent a virtual-reality based visuo-proprioceptive disparity task in which they performed reiterative reaching movements towards visual targets while observing a virtual-hand that could be spatially congruent or displaced at different disparities from the real hand\u2019s position. Ownership was assessed by collecting reaching errors (implicit) and asking ownership judgments toward the virtual-hand (explicit). Errors were modeled using a Bayesian Causal Inference framework in which ownership for the virtual-hand resulted from a weighted average between pure visual and pure proprioceptive guidance according to their relative precision (i.e., bottom-up sensory components), and to the a priori probability that the virtual-hand was one\u2019s own (i.e., top-down prior). Results showed that both explicit and implicit ownership towards spatially incongruent virtual-hands was higher with advancing age. Moreover, the sensory components extracted from the model revealed higher proprioceptive and lower visual variability in older adults, suggesting that as proprioception declines, visual input increasingly assumes a dominant role. No age-effect was found on the prior (i.e., top-down component). We concluded that ownership progressively changes from adolescence to old age, mostly driven by a physiological reduction in proprioceptive abilities. The sensory recalibration toward visual reliance might reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain coherent body ownership despite age-related sensory decline.",

      "title": "Variable admittance control with sEMG-based support for wearable wrist exoskeleton",
      "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

      "title": "Network topological reorganization mechanisms of primary visual cortex under multimodal stimulation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe functional connectivity topology of the primary visual cortex (V1) shapes sensory processing and cross-modal integration, yet how different sensory modalities reorganize V1 network architecture remains unclear. We hypothesized that multimodal input drives a shift from hub-centric, modular processing toward globally integrated, distributed configurations.MethodsWe performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice to record population activity in V1 during unimodal visual (V) and bimodal visuotactile (V+T) stimulation. From fluorescence time series, we constructed functional connectivity networks and quantified graph-theoretical metrics, including betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, degree centrality, global efficiency, and modularity. Networks were computed per animal and compared across conditions using appropriate non-parametric statistics.ResultsUnimodal visual stimulation increased betweenness centrality and highlighted prominent hub nodes, supporting locally modular, hub-centric information control. In contrast, bimodal visuotactile stimulation elevated closeness centrality and global efficiency, broadened connectivity, and reduced modularity, indicating enhanced global integration with more distributed information flow. Moreover, under unimodal conditions the top five centrality nodes exhibited significantly stronger calcium responses than other neurons, whereas this response hierarchy was abolished under bimodal stimulation.DiscussionV1 dynamically balances local specialization and global integration through context-dependent topological reconfiguration: unimodal processing relies on hub-centric, modular architectures, while cross-modal input promotes globally optimized, distributed networks with higher connectivity efficiency. These findings provide a network-level framework for multisensory integration and offer insights relevant to theories of sensory computation and potential strategies to harness cross-modal plasticity.",

      "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
      "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

      "title": "An Active Insole to Reduce Plantar Pressure Loading: Using Predictive Finite Element Driven Soft Hydraulic Actuators to Minimize Plantar Pressure and the Pressure Time Integral for Diabetic Foot Ulceration Risk Management",
      "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

      "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
      "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",
