      "title": "Network analysis of optimal deep or machine learning strategies for classification and detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease based on MRI scanning",
      "content": "BackgroundAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) presents a significant global health challenge, with its prevalence projected to increase substantially by 2050. Despite its widespread impact, the underlying causes and mechanisms remain incompletely understood, complicating efforts toward effective diagnosis and treatment. Pathologically, AD is marked by the accumulation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, but the relationship between these factors and disease progression is complex and heterogeneous.ObjectiveThe present study aimed to compare the efficacy of different deep/machine learning models based on MRI scanning.MethodsThe study follows rigorous systematic review protocols, adhering to the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews and Interventions and the PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was employed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, Medline, and EMBASE. Advanced statistical methods were used for data synthesis and analysis, incorporating network meta-analysis and machine learning techniques to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of different diagnostic models.ResultsThe meta-analysis included 11 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria. The studies employed various machine learning algorithms, including CNN, ResNet, and DenseNet, to classify AD and distinguish it from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. The results indicate that CNN and ResNet consistently outperform other models in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, the integration of nanotechnology and AI-driven diagnostics demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the diagnostic process.ConclusionDespite challenges such as data heterogeneity and the interpretability of AI-driven models, the study highlights the transformative potential of computational techniques and advanced imaging technologies in AD diagnosis and management. The integration of network-based analyses and machine learning approaches offers promising avenues for future research, aiming to revolutionize the understanding and approach to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

      "content": "Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) present a profound clinical enigma, manifesting as a heterogeneous continuum ranging from the chaotic volatility of acute psychosis to the impenetrable rigidity of systematized delusions. While neurobiological research has independently implicated NMDA receptor hypofunction or dopaminergic hyperfunction as cardinal pathophysiological distinct mechanisms, a computational framework capable of bridging these distinct cellular deficits to the spectrum's vast phenomenological diversity remains elusive. Here, we propose a biologically plausible neural model using a dynamic Bayesian inference with separable positive and negative prediction-error pathways. We demonstrate that NMDA hypofunction selectively blunts negative prediction errors, fostering rigid, bias-dominated beliefs, while dopaminergic hyperfunction uniformly amplifies error signals, driving volatile, observation-dominated states. Their interaction reconstructs SSDs as a continuous bias-volatility spectrum, accounting for key neurophysiological markers and offering a theoretical foundation for mechanism-based patient stratification.",

      "title": "Reward-driven emergence of auditory pattern encoding in the primate motor system",
      "content": "The ability to anticipate rhythmic patterns is fundamental to human experience, enabling music appreciation, speech comprehension, and dancing in sync to music. How the brain learns to use acoustic information to guide motor behavior remains a key question whose neural underpinnings and evolutionary origins are debated, especially in non-human primates. To understand how brain areas involved in motor control naively respond to predictable tone patterns, we recorded large single neuron populations across primary somatosensory (S1), primary motor (M1), dorsal premotor (PMd), supplementary motor (SMA), pre-supplementary motor (preSMA) cortices, globus pallidus interna (GPi), and medial geniculate body (MGB) of a rhesus monkey. During passive listening (Experiment 1) with a reward only at the end of each trial, primarily the MGB, not motor areas, responded to the auditory tone patterns, ruling out the spontaneous entrainment of motor activity to auditory patterns. Almost all areas robustly represented the elapsed time within the trial, suggesting a general tracking of trial progression and reward structure. Next, we tested if motor areas learn to respond to auditory patterns if associated with rewards. When each tone was simultaneously accompanied by a liquid reward (Experiment 2), all areas except S1 showed clear responses to the tone patterns. To test if the tone responses persisted, the reward contingency was subsequently removed (Experiment 3). Strikingly, although the reward was delivered only at the trial's end as in Experiment 1, GPi neurons continued to track the occurrence of the tones. These findings suggest that while basic sensory processing of tone patterns occurs in the MGB, higher-order processing in motor areas is profoundly shaped by reward association. This reorganisation of neural responsiveness shows that the capacity for auditory association can be elicited in the motor system through appropriate motivational contexts.",

      "title": "A functional influence based circuit motif that constrains the set of plausible algorithms of cortical function",
      "content": "There are several plausible algorithms for cortical function that are specific enough to make testable predictions of the interactions between functionally identified cell types. Many of these algorithms are based on some variant of predictive processing. Here we set out to experimentally distinguish between two such predictive processing variants. A central point of variability between them lies in the proposed vertical communication between layer 2/3 and layer 5, which stems from the diverging assumptions about the computational role of layer 5. One assumes a hierarchically organized architecture and proposes that, within a given node of the network, layer 5 conveys unexplained bottom-up input to prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. The other proposes a non-hierarchical architecture in which internal representation neurons of layer 5 provide predictions for the local prediction error neurons of layer 2/3. We show that the functional influence of layer 2/3 cell types on layer 5 is incompatible with the hierarchical variant, while the functional influence of layer 5 cell types on prediction error neurons of layer 2/3 is incompatible with the non-hierarchical variant. Given these data, we can constrain the space of plausible algorithms of cortical function. We propose a model for cortical function based on a combination of a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) and predictive processing that makes experimentally testable predictions.",

      "title": "A Detailed Model for Understanding the Human Neocortex",
      "content": "The neocortex underlies cognitive abilities that set humans apart from other species. Although Ramon y Cajal initiated its study in the 19th century, much about its fundamental properties remain poorly understood. Biologically detail modeling, has been shown to serve as a tool to understand the modeled system better. By comparing computational models for different species we can highlight functional differences between them, find their anatomical or physiological basis and thus improve our understanding of cortical function. In this study we built a detailed model of a human cortical microcircuit following an established workflow. We compared the human data and results against a previously published reconstruction of rat cortical circuitry. To parametrize the human model, we gathered new original data on human morphological reconstructions, axonal bouton densities, single cell and synaptic recordings. We combined them with data available in the literature and open-sourced databases. We also developed various strategies to overcome the missing data, such as generalizing or adapt- ing data from rodents. The resulting model consists of seven columnar units with similar characteristics. Each column has a radius of 476 um, a height of 2622 um, a volume of 1.86 mm3, a total cell density of 24,186 cells/mm3, on the order of 35,000 cells, around 12 million connections and approximately 47 million synapses. Comparing the rat and the human model showed that the human cortex is less dense in terms of cell bodies than the rodent cortex. Human cells have more complex branching, but lower bouton densities than rodent cells. However, the number of connections between cell types is similar.",

      "content": "A typical neuron receives thousands of inputs and is able to adapt the strength of its synapses to store new information and meet ongoing computational demands. The synaptic response to plasticity induction is stochastic and spatially structured but is traditionally described by deterministic models representing the enquote{average} dynamics. Growing experimental evidence indicates that not only the stimulation protocol determines the plasticity outcome but that the initial synaptic sizes, their fluctuations, and the spatial competition for the plasticity-relevant proteins play a decisive role. This probabilistic perspective makes it hard to predict the fate of a given synapse and requires a conceptual shift from a single synapse view to a probabilistic multi-spine competitive process where the plasticity needs and the available resources are considered together. Here, we propose a data-driven modeling framework able to predict collective plasticity outcomes along a dendrite based on the initial size, the number, and the spatial distance between simultaneously stimulated synapses. Our data analysis reveals a log-normal distribution of protein numbers for many plasticity-mediating proteins and shows that this log-normal protein allocation constrains and controls the collective plasticity outcome across multiple stimulated and non-stimulated synapses while preserving a global size distribution. Our findings highlight how local stochastic processes and global protein allocation rules give rise to synaptic plasticity outcomes, offering a new framework to understand and predict dendritic computation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.21492v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This contribution explores how the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into organizational practices can be effectively framed through a socio-technical perspective to comply with the requirements of Human-centered AI (HCAI). Instead of viewing AI merely as a technical tool, the analysis emphasizes the importance of embedding AI into communication, collaboration, and decision-making processes within organizations from a human-centered perspective. Ten case-based patterns illustrate how AI support of predictive maintenance can be organized to address quality assurance and continuous improvement and to provide different types of sup-port for HCAI. The analysis shows that AI adoption often requires and enables new forms of organizational learning, where specialists jointly interpret AI output, adapt workflows, and refine rules for system improve-ment. Different dimensions and levels of socio-technical integration of AI are considered to reflect the effort and benefits of keeping the organization in the loop.",

      "title": "Are they just delegating? Cross-Sample Predictions on University Students' & Teachers' Use of AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.21490v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mutual trust between teachers and students is a prerequisite for effective teaching, learning, and assessment in higher education. Accurate predictions about the other group's use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) are fundamental for such trust. However, the disruptive rise of AI has transformed academic work practices, raising important questions about how teachers and students use these tools and how well they can estimate each other's usage. While the frequency of use is well studied, little is known about how AI is used, and comparisons with similar practices are rare. This study surveyed German university teachers (N = 113) and students (N = 123) on the frequency of AI use and the degree of delegation across six identical academic tasks. Participants also provided incentivized cross-sample predictions of the other group's AI use to assess the accuracy of their predictions. We find that students reported higher use of AI and greater delegation than teachers. Both groups significantly overestimated the other group's use, with teachers predicting very frequent use and high delegation by students, and students assuming teachers use AI similarly to themselves. These findings reveal a perception gap between teachers' and students' expectations and actual AI use. Such gaps may hinder trust and effective collaboration, underscoring the need for open dialogue about AI practices in academia and for policies that support the equitable and transparent integration of AI tools in higher education.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.21460v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: LLM-assisted technologies are increasingly used to support cognitive processing and information interpretation, yet their role in aiding memory recall, and how people choose to engage with them, remains underexplored. We studied participants who watched a short robbery video (approximating a one-time eyewitness scenario) and composed recall statements using either a default GPT or a guided GPT prompted with a standardized eyewitness protocol. Results show that, in the default condition, participants who believed they had a clearer understanding of the event were more likely to trust GPT's output, whereas in the guided condition, participants showed stronger alignment between subjective clarity and actual recall. Additionally, participants evaluated the legitimacy of the individuals in the incident differently across conditions. Interaction analysis further revealed that default-GPT users spontaneously developed diverse strategies, including building on existing recollections, requesting potentially missing details, and treating GPT as a recall coach. This work shows how GPT-user interplay can subconsciously shape beliefs and perceptions of remembered events.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.21271v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While visual augmentation dominates the augmented reality landscape, devices like Meta Ray-Ban audio smart glasses signal growing industry movement toward audio augmented reality (AAR). Hearing is a primary channel for sensing context, anticipating change, and navigating social space, yet AAR's everyday potential remains underexplored. We address this gap through a collaborative autoethnography (N=5, authoring) and an online survey (N=74). We identify ten roles for AAR, grouped into three categories: task- and utility-oriented, emotional and social, and perceptual collaborator. These roles are further layered with a rhythmic and embodied collaborator framing, mapping them onto micro-, meso-, and macro-rhythms of everyday life. Our analysis surfaces nuanced tensions, such as blocking distractions without erasing social presence, highlighting the need for context-aware design. This paper contributes a foundational and forward-looking framework for AAR in everyday life, providing design groundwork for systems attuned to daily routines, sensory engagement, and social expectations.",
