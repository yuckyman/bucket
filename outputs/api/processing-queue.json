      "title": "APPNL-F knock-in Alzheimer's Disease model mice reveal etiological convergence of aging and amyloidosis",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, with a steadily increasing prevalence. Despite the advent of some plaque-degrading therapies, early intervention strategies are still suboptimal, largely due to an incomplete understanding of how early pathological events of amyloid-b (Ab) plaque deposition entail or accompany the neuroinflammatory processes that ensue. The APPNL-F mouse line is a second-generation endogenous-promoter knock-in AD model that represents a valuable tool to dissect disease mechanisms and evaluate therapeutic strategies. However, the early prodromal stage remains poorly characterized. Here we performed in-depth analyses in both homozygous (APPNL-F/NL-F) and heterozygous (APPNL-F/WT) mice at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Among a battery of behavioural tests, the first phenotype was observed at 9 months with defects in spatial memory. Using hypersensitive MSD-ELISA technology assays we quantified distinct Ab species and found that Ab42 oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrillar aggregates were detectable as early as 6 months of age in homozygous APPNL-F/NL-F mice. By 9 months, their Ab42 levels increased markedly and overt Ab plaques were detected, histologically associated with recruited glial cells. Targeted RT-qPCR analysis of neuroinflammation-related genes in the cortex also identified 9 months as a molecular tipping point in these 'middle aged' APPNL-F mice. To characterize the etiological signal transduction at the cellular level, we isolated microglia, the brain resident immune cells, whose contribution to AD pathogenesis is now well established. Sequencing around 5,000 individual cells from both 12-month-old APPNL F/NL F and APPWT/WT CD11b+ myeloid cells revealed that the buildup of amyloidosis was associated with an accelerated shift of microglia from a homeostatic toward a senescent-like state. Together, these findings highlight the 6-12 month period of the APPNL-F/NL-F model as a powerful system to study the interdependence between microglial senescence and amyloidosis in driving AD progression.",

      "content": "Accurate and efficient memory processing is essential for survival. Recent work in human subjects and animal models has suggested that memory processing may differ in meaningful ways between males and females. In mice, contextual fear memory (CFM) encoding, consolidation, and recall have been well studied, and the mouse hippocampus and amygdala have been implicated in these processes. The present study addresses how the specific contribution of these brain regions to each stage CFM processing in female vs. male mice. We find that male and female mice show no differences in CFM recall, nor in sleep behavior in the hours following single-trial contextual fear conditioning (CFC), which is essential for CFM consolidation. However, females, but not males, show significantly increased expression of cFos in dorsal hippocampal CA1 and CA2 neurons during CFM encoding. On the other hand, males, but not females, show increased cFos expression among DG granule cells during CFM consolidation. These findings highlight the fact that the neurobiological underpinnings of memory processing may differ between males and females, even when recall performance is identical.",

With that update, the collection is now in its final form in that its problems are set in stone, and I will move on to create something else in my life.</p> <p>Curated over the past decade and constantly field tested in various courses in TMU, this problem collection contains coding problems suitable for beginning Python learners all the way to the senior level undergraduate algorithms and other computer science courses. I wanted to include unusual problems that you don't see in textbooks and other online problem collections so that these problems involve both new and classic concepts of computer science and discrete math. Students will decide if I was successful in this.</p> <p>These problems were inspired by all the recreational math materials on books and YouTube channels that I have watched over the past ten years. I learned a ton of new stuff myself just by understanding this material to be able to implement it efficiently and effectively.</p> <p>The repository is fully self-contained, and comes with fully automated fuzz tester script to instantly check the correctness of student solutions. I hope that even in this age of vibe coding and the emergence of superhuman LLM's that can solve all these problems on a spot, this problem collection will continue to be useful for anyone over the world who wants to get strong at coding, Python and computer science.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kona_ackley\"> /u/kona_ackley </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qspmhx/369_problems_for_109_python_problems_completed/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qspmhx/369_problems_for_109_python_problems_completed/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "A Conserved Locus Coeruleus fMRI Signature of Brain-State Transitions across Sleep, Anesthesia, and Wakefulness",
      "content": "Neuromodulatory systems dynamically reconfigure large-scale brain networks to support adaptation across behavioral and cognitive states. The locus coeruleus (LC), which broadcasts noradrenaline throughout the forebrain, is a central regulator of arousal and state-dependent dynamics. However, how LC activity manifests in brain-wide organization across physiological contexts, and how it biases fMRI connectivity, remains poorly understood. Using an optogenetically informed cross-species framework, we identify a transient LC-derived spatiotemporal pattern of brain activity accompanying brain-state transitions under progressively naturalistic conditions: controlled LC stimulation and endogenous LC fluctuations in anesthetized mice, sleep-wake transitions in rodents and humans, and resting-state activity in awake humans. This LC-derived signature is conserved across species and contexts, leaving a robust and detectable imprint on the BOLD signal. Critically, the prevalence of LC events systematically biases functional connectivity metrics in human fMRI. These findings establish LC activity as a mechanistically interpretable source of variability in resting-state measurements, with direct implications for the interpretation of fMRI biomarkers in arousal-related disorders.",

      "title": "Feasibility of PIANO-Cog for older adults: A randomised controlled pilot trial exploring changes in cognition and brain microstructure.",
      "content": "Background: Executive functions are a key target of cognitive interventions for older adults due to their central role in daily functioning and maintaining a good quality of life. Piano training has been proposed as an ecologically valid method of improving cognition and brain structure in older adults. The primary aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Piano Instruction for Adult Novices as an Online Cognitive Intervention (PIANO-Cog), a novel bespoke 8-week self-guided piano training programme for adults over 50 years of age, and (ii) assess the feasibility of conducting a fully-powered randomised controlled trial (RCT), including recruitment, retention, and adherence. Secondary aims explored effects of PIANO-Cog on executive functions and brain microstructure using advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Method: Thirty-three healthy music novices aged 51-80 years (M = 63.73, SD = 7.94) participated in a two-arm unblinded feasibility RCT. Participants were assigned by stratified allocation for age and sex to either (i) 8 weeks of PIANO-Cog, requiring 30 minutes of practice, 5 days per week, or (ii) a passive control group. Cognitive assessment and MRI scanning were conducted before and after the intervention using a strong-gradient (300mT/m) 3T Connectom scanner to acquire multi-shell DWI data with b-values ranging from 200 to 6,000 s/mm2. Grey and white matter microstructure were modelled with Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) and Neurite Orientation Density and Dispersion Imaging (NODDI). Results: According to predefined criteria, feasibility was established for recruitment (91.6%), retention (75%) and adherence (>100%) rates. Preliminary observations suggest that piano training compared with control was associated with improvements in verbal fluency and multiple changes in brain microstructure including increases in apparent soma size and radius and reductions in extracellular signal in frontal and temporal cortical regions, larger apparent neurite density in right inferior frontal gyrus and changes in neurite dispersion in left middle temporal and right precentral gyri. Discussion: The results demonstrate that short-term remote piano training is a feasible cognitive intervention for healthy adults over 50. Preliminary evidence suggest that PIANO-Cog was associated cognitive improvements and changes in brain microstructure in executive, auditory and motor regions.",

      "title": "Electroencephalography signatures of motor error and stimulus-driven attention in electrical muscle stimulation-induced wrist movements under motor imagery",
      "content": "This study examines how electroencephalography (EEG) signatures are modulated during passive movements induced by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). Specifically, we focused on three key factors: (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions (motor imagery and waiting). We tested how error-related neural responses are modulated by the mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs during motor imagery. To this end, we introduced a wrist-movement paradigm combining motor imagery with EMS. Participants either imagined wrist dorsiflexion toward visual targets or passively waited. EMS was then applied to induce passive wrist movements. EMS intensity and presentation rate were manipulated so that the magnitude of stepwise motor error (physical deviation from the target) and stimulation-driven attention varied inversely, allowing us to evaluate their respective neural effects. Event-related potential (ERP) components at approximately 700 ms reflected graded evaluation of motor error. An ERP component at approximately 300 ms was modulated primarily by EMS intensity and presentation rate, consistent with stimulus-driven attention. Mu-band suppression reflected the match between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Theta-band enhancement in the absence of motor imagery suggested increased sensory unpredictability due to the lack of internally generated predictions, whereas beta-band activity may have been related to fluctuations in state prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed motor imagery with the EMS wrist-movement paradigm is the first to investigate how (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions shape EEG signatures during passive, electrically induced movements. Understanding how these neural signals vary with mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of error processing and sensory prediction in the human brain.",
