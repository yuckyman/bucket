      "title": "Spatial layout of visual specialization is shaped by competing default mode and sensory networks",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain encodes information started with a map but turned into a maze: paths multiplied; boundaries blurred. Neurons tuned to specific features are not confined to single regions, but distributed across the cortex. Retinotopy, once thought limited to early visual areas, now appears in over 20 cortical regions, from the tip of the occipital cortex to the shore of the lateral frontal cortex. To describe and understand these complex mosaics of functional specialization, we focus on the spatial influences that shape their emergence across the cortical sheet. To this end, we developed Spatial Component Decomposition (SCD), a sparse dictionary learning framework that locates sources of spatial influence without relying on prior assumptions from systems neuroscience. Applied to MRI data capturing retinotopic maps, SCD reveals a dominant linear gradient extending over 60 mm from V1 and covering all the known posterior visual areas. Yet, it also revealed systematic competition from other primary sensory areas and default mode transmodal hubs. These suppressive influences shape the cortical embedding of visual information, even during purely visual tasks. Our results suggest that functional specialization emerges from spatial competition between representational systems, not just from feedforward inputs.",

      "title": "The effect of extended early rehabilitation on the treatment outcome of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in all age groups. The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",
