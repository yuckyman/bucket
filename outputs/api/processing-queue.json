      "title": "Opposing Autonomic Pathways Link Childhood Trauma to Mental Imagery Deficits",
      "content": "Although childhood trauma alters neurobiological systems supporting emotion regulation and autonomic function, mechanisms linking trauma to mental imagery deficits remain unexplored. Here we examined whether autonomic nervous system symptoms mediate trauma-imagery associations in a general population sample (n = 433). All trauma types showed associations with reduced imagery vividness (r = -.12 to -.23), with emotional neglect and emotional abuse demonstrating the strongest effects. Physical trauma types and emotional abuse correlated with increased autonomic symptoms (r = .35-.38). Parallel mediation analyses revealed that autonomic symptom burden (BPQ ANS subscale), but not anxiety, significantly mediated trauma-imagery relationships through opposing mechanisms. Physical trauma types and emotional abuse showed negative indirect effects through heightened autonomic reactivity, with complete mediation for emotional abuse and physical neglect. In contrast, emotional neglect showed a positive indirect effect through reduced autonomic reactivity (a pattern that emerged when controlling for other trauma types) alongside the strongest direct effect on imagery. These findings demonstrate that childhood trauma impacts mental imagery through distinct autonomic mechanisms--hyperreactive dysregulation for physical/emotional abuse versus hyporeactive blunting for emotional neglect--suggesting autonomic-targeted interventions should be tailored to trauma type.",

      "title": "Semaglutide Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Mice",
      "content": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown promise in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with emerging evidence suggesting these effects may be driven by modulation of neuroinflammation. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying GLP-1 RA effects on neuroinflammation remain poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, we investigated how semaglutide coordinates cellular responses to resolve neuroinflammation. We find that semaglutide prevents brain infiltration of neutrophils, excessive cytokine release, and suppresses neuroinflammation-associated transcriptional signatures specifically in microglia, endothelial cells, and a subset of pericytes. Mechanistically, we identify a subset of Glp1r-expressing neurons in the dorsal vagal complex that, upon semaglutide treatment, regulate genes involved in anti-inflammatory signaling. Semaglutide-modulated pathways overlap with inflammatory signatures found in human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, suggesting broad relevance for conditions involving neuroinflammation. Together, these findings reveal how GLP-1R signaling orchestrates resolution of neuroinflammation through coordinated multi-cellular programs.",

      "title": "Glial vesicular transmitter release is not critical for courtship conditioning memory in Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "Glial cell function is believed to be critical for the regulation of cognitive processes such as learning and memory but the mechanisms by which glia regulate memory are still poorly elucidated. There is evidence that glial metabolic support and neurotransmitter synaptic clearance are essential for memory processes. But glial cells can also influence neuronal activity by the vesicular release of gliotransmitters in a calcium-dependent manner. Whether gliotransmission also is critical for memory process remains controversial. Here, we explored the role of gliotransmission in Drosophila courtship memory using the thermo-sensitive Shibirets mutant in combination with the UAS/Gal4 expression system, in which glial vesicular transmitter release can be rapid and reversibly impaired. We found that the formation, maintenance and decline of courtship memory were unaffected by the blockade of vesicular release of gliotransmitters. Therefore, our data support the view that the release of gliotransmitters is not an ubiquitously necessary regulatory mechanism of memory and forgetting processes.",

      "title": "Regular parental exercise before mating influences offspring lower adiposity associated to hypothalamic neurodevelopmental changes",
      "content": "Physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide and affects not only individual health but also the health of future generations. However, the impact of parental physical activity, limited to the pre-mating period, on offspring body weight and composition remains poorly understood. Using a voluntary wheel running approach in mice, we uncovered that post-weaning offspring body weight and composition changes are modulated by the combined effects of pre-mating parental exercise and parental age. Notably, during lactation, pre-mating parental exercise reduced offspring visceral and subcutaneous adiposity, shortened tibia length in female offspring, and influenced offspring transcriptomic profiles of the hypothalamus, the central region regulating body weight and energy balance. These results highlight that regular pre-mating parental exercise may induce offspring neurodevelopmental changes. Although pre-mating exercise minimally impacted the expression of lactation-related genes in maternal subcutaneous fat, as well as breastmilk nutritional composition and miRNA content, these modest miRNA changes may nonetheless influence offspring hypothalamic regulation. Together, these data provide a comprehensive understanding of how parental age and pre-mating exercise impact post-weaning offspring body weight and composition and offer deeper insights into how regular pre-mating parental exercise influences offspring physiology during lactation.",
