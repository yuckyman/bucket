      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "content": "Accurate detection and segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a challenging task due to their small size, irregular shape, and variability in different imaging modalities. Precise segmentation of MS lesions from brain MRI is vital for early diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, and treatment planning. We introduce MS-DASPNet, a Dual Attention Guided Deep Neural Network specifically designed to address the challenges of MS lesion detection, including small lesion sizes, low contrast, and heterogeneous appearance. MS-DASPNet employs a VGG-16-based encoder, an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) bottleneck for multi-scale context learning, and dual attention modules in each skip connection to simultaneously refine spatial details and enhance channel-wise feature representation. Evaluations on four publicly available datasets, namely ISBI-2015, Mendeley, MICCAI-2016, and MICCAI-2021, demonstrate that MS-DASPNet achieves superior Precision, Dice, Sensitivity, and Jaccard scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. MS-DASPNet attains a Dice score of 0.8736 on the MICCAI-2016 dataset and 0.8706 on the MICCAI-2021 dataset, both outperforming existing segmentation techniques, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in accurate MS lesion segmentation.",

      "content": "Upon hearing objects collide, humans can estimate physical attributes such as material and mass. Although the physics of sound generation is well established, the inverse problem that listeners solve - of inferring physical parameters from sound - remains poorly understood. Classical accounts posit the use of acoustic cues that correlate with physical variables, but do not explain how humans might distinguish multiple concurrent physical causes. To study this problem, we built a probabilistic generative model of impact sounds, combining theoretical acoustics with statistics of object resonances measured from hundreds of everyday objects, and used it to synthesize and manipulate experimental stimuli. Humans accurately judged object properties from collision sounds. However, when both of the colliding objects varied, performance was impaired if the distribution of object resonances deviated from those measured in real-world objects. The results suggest that listeners use internal physical models to separate the acoustic contributions of objects in the world.",

      "title": "A Key Regulator of Dendritic Morphology in Supragranular Neocortex Impacts Mismatch Negativity",
      "content": "Background: Cytoskeletal structure and neuronal function are heavily intertwined, and altered pyramidal neuron morphology (e.g., reduced dendritic arbors) has been consistently identified in the neocortex of individuals with psychiatric disorders. A missense mutation in Kalrn (Kalrn-PT) enhances activation of RhoA, a cytoskeletal regulator, and leads to adolescent-onset dendritic regression in supragranular auditory cortex. To investigate the relationship between this spatiotemporally altered cytoskeletal structure and psychiatric-relevant dysfunction, we examine the functional impacts of this genetic mutation, focusing on mismatch negativity -- a common biomarker of altered sensory integration that matures across adolescence. Methods: In Kalrn-PT and littermate wild-type mice, pyramidal dendritic morphology was assessed across primary visual cortex (V1) layers using Golgi staining (n=172 neurons/26 mice). Local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking were recorded during a visual oddball sequence (n=25 mice). Deviance detection -- the rodent neural analogue of mismatch negativity -- was analyzed across V1 layers. Results: Kalrn-PT mice exhibit reductions in V1 dendritic length specific to layer 2/3, mirroring observations in post-mortem samples from people with psychiatric disorders. Deviance detection was reduced in LFPs from Kalrn-PT mice and absent in layer 2/3 neurons, despite typical feature selectivity and firing rates. These deficits were accompanied by reduced functional connectivity between visual and frontal areas. Conclusions: These results highlight alterations in higher-level sensory cortical integration in Kalrn-PT mice and demonstrate that adolescent-onset, disease-relevant structural and functional phenotypes can be linked by a common upstream effector. Further, these alterations appear restricted to supragranular layers, demonstrating an outsized role for Kalrn, particularly longer isoforms, in superficial neocortex.",

      "title": "Subthreshold Kir and Ih currents modulate excitability of Layer 1 VIP interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Cortical layer 1 (L1) is a key site for integrating top-down and bottom-up information and is populated by inhibitory interneurons, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells. These interneurons regulate information flow across the cortical column by disinhibiting pyramidal neurons, yet the subthreshold ionic mechanisms that shape their excitability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the electrophysiological properties of L1b VIP interneurons in mouse mPFC, focusing on the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) and inward-rectifying potassium current (Kir). Using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we find that L1b VIP interneurons exhibit constitutively active Ih and Kir conductances. Inhibition of Ih with ZD-7288 hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP), increased input resistance (Rin), and prolonged action potential (AP) duration without altering rheobase or firing frequency, while increasing EPSP-spike coupling probability. Blocking Kir with BaCl2 depolarized the RMP, increased Rin and membrane time constant, reduced rheobase, increased firing frequency, and similarly enhanced EPSP-spike probability and AP duration. Voltage-clamp experiments confirmed the presence of ZD-7288-sensitive Ih and BaCl2-sensitive Kir currents of small amplitude but operating on a high-resistance membrane, consistent with a strong impact on excitability. In contrast, neither Ih nor Kir inhibition affected the amplitude or frequency of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs, indicating that these currents do not measurably alter basal excitatory synaptic transmission. Immunofluorescence revealed weak somatic HCN1 and no detectable HCN2 expression in L1b VIP interneurons. Notably, Kir inhibition unmasked an Ih-dependent voltage sag during hyperpolarizing steps, suggesting that constitutive Kir activity normally masks Ih recruitment at subthreshold potentials. Together, these results indicate that Ih and Kir are active near RMP in L1b VIP interneurons and jointly regulate their passive properties, intrinsic excitability, and EPSP-spike coupling, therefore shaping how L1 VIP cells filter incoming signals and influence information flow within the prefrontal cortical column.",

      "title": "Semantic axes in the brain support analogical representations",
      "content": "In vectorial embeddings of word meaning, semantic features often reflect consistent directions, or axes, within a representational space. A classic example is gender: the vector spanning boy to girl can be added to the embedding for king to predict queen. Here we show that the same principle governs semantically driven neural responses in the human brain. We recorded single-neuron activity in three brain regions while participants listened to podcasts. Across fifteen analogical categories, including gender, number, and antonymy, we observed consistent vectorial directions, resulting in parallelogram structure within the neural manifold. Among pronouns, vectors corresponding to grammatical case, number, person, and possession obeyed the principle of commutativity, resulting in a prismatic structure, demonstrating that semantic axes can be factorized. We found parallelogram structure in all three regions, with some regional specialization: noun pluralization was more robust in the hippocampus than in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or orbitofrontal cortex, whereas verbal conjugation effects were more robust in the ACC. Finally, we found evidence for partial functional specialization at the neuron level: neurons most strongly involved in one analogy type were less involved in others. These principles parallel representational structure observed in large language models. Together, these findings support a geometric basis for analogical reasoning.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of disrupted neurodevelopment after Zika virus infection in infancy",
      "content": "Congenital and early-life Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can result in neurologic deficits. Precise mechanisms of injury, especially in the more subtle presentation of postnatal infection, are not fully elucidated. Here, we defined the effects of ZIKV on the developing brain using single cell transcriptomics, histopathology and design-based stereology, diffusion MRI, and neurobehavioral assessments in infant rhesus macaques. ZIKV upregulated interferon-stimulated genes in activated microglia and cell death pathways in neurons and downregulated metabolism and differentiation genes in mature oligodendrocytes. Abnormal micro-organization of the corpus collosum and limbic white matter tracts was seen on diffusion weighted imaging. A curated gene set associated with autism spectrum disorder risk was negatively enriched in inhibitory and excitatory neurons from ZIKV-infected infants, with increased emotional reactivity already evident two weeks following infection. From single cells to organism-level behaviors, these results define the pathways and processes disrupted by early-life ZIKV infection.",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
