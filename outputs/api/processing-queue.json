      "title": "First In Vivo Demonstration of Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery of Memantine Using NosaPlugs Nasal Inserts",
      "content": "Treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge due to ineffective drug delivery to the brain. In recent years, intranasal administration has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for nose-to-brain delivery. Compared to other routes of administration, nose-to-brain delivery provides a possibility of bypassing both the blood-brain-barrier and the first-pass metabolism in the liver, allowing for a decrease in the delivered dose and thereby a reduced risk of systemic side-effects. While the most common nasal devices, spray pumps, ensure a wide distribution in the nasal cavity and a fast onset of action, a slower release and increased retention time is desired for treatment of many neurological disorders. In this study, we tested the feasibility of a novel nasal insert, NosaPlugs, for prolonged release and delivery of memantine. Using an in vitro anatomically realistic nasal model, we demonstrated cumulative release of memantine from the nasal inserts up to eight hours. Additionally, the therapeutic substance was distributed to all parts of the nasal cavity, with higher amounts accumulating in the middle part. In vivo, an acute dose of memantine in the gas phase released from the nasal device reached pharmacologically relevant levels in both plasma and the brains of the mice. Future research should investigate the release and delivery of alternative substances interesting for brain diseases, and larger animal models are required to determine the efficacy of nose-to-brain delivery using NosaPlugs nasal inserts. Importantly, our study provides the first proof-of-concept that NosaPlugs can serve as an effective intranasal device for targeted drug delivery to the brain.",

      "title": "Calcium-binding protein expression alone is insufficient to identify and classify GABAergic neurons in macaque cortex",
      "content": "Understanding neuron subclasses and their functional consequences can contribute to understanding brain circuits. A scheme long used to classify GABAergic neurons in the neocortex is based on expression of three calcium-binding proteins (CBPs): parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR). Because CB and CR are frequently co-expressed by individual neurons in rodents, this scheme has been replaced by one based on PV and two signaling peptides: somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In macaques, however, CBPs are generally not co-expressed, and so their use has persisted despite suggestions that the underlying populations are not, in fact, entirely GABAergic. We set out to quantitatively evaluate CBPs as a classification scheme for GABAergic neurons in early and mid-level visual regions in macaque cortex. Combining immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we find that up to half of neurons expressing CBPs are likely not GABAergic. Furthermore, contrary to what has been previously suggested, the GABAergic subpopulations cannot be distinguished based on staining intensity. Thus, the CBP-based classification scheme is not valid, at least as it has traditionally been used. Instead, we find support for co-labeling CB and CR neurons with SST and VIP, an approach that can identify GABAergic subpopulations within the CBP classes; or simply adopting the PV/SST/VIP scheme. We discuss the functional implications of expressing these various cell type markers, and how consideration of marker functions can support proper selection of a classification scheme for a given experimental purpose.",

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

The heavily lifting is done in Rust. If you find this useful, please star it ! If you need some feature currently missing, or if you find a bug, please drop by the issue tracker. I want this to be as useful as possible to as many people as possible !</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/neutrinoceros/ahe\">https://github.com/neutrinoceros/ahe</a></p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Histogram Equalization is a common data-processing trick to improve visual contrast in an image. ahe supports 3 different algorithms: simple histogram equalization (HE), together with 2 variants of Adaptive Histogram Equalization (AHE), namely sliding-tile and tile-interpolation. Contrast limitation is supported for all three.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Data analysts, researchers dealing with images, including (but not restricted to) biologists, geologists, astronomers... as well as generative artists and photographers.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><code>ahe</code> is designed as an alternative to <code>scikit-image</code> for the 2 functions it replaces: <code>skimage.exposure.equalize_(adapt)hist</code> Compared to its direct competition, <code>ahe</code> has better performance, portability, much smaller and portable binaries, and a much more consistent interface, all algorithms are exposed through a single function, making the feature set intrinsically cohesive.

      "title": "UV + FastAPI + Tortoise ORM template",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I found myself writing this code every time I start a new project, so I made it a template.</p> <p>I wrote a pretty-descriptive guide on how it's structured in the README, it's basically <code>project.lib</code> for application support code, <code>project.db</code> for the ORM models and migrations, and <code>project.api</code> for the FastAPI code, route handlers, and Pydantic schemas.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>It's a starter template for writing FastAPI + Tortoise ORM code. Some key notes:</p> <ul> <li>Redoc by default, no swagger.</li> <li>Automatic markdown-based OpenAPI tag and API documentation from files in a directory.</li> <li>NanoID-based, includes some little types to help with that.</li> <li>The usual FastAPI.</li> <li>Error types and handlers bundled-in.</li> <li>Simple architecture. API, DB, and lib.</li> <li>Bundled-in .env settings support.</li> <li>A template not a framework, so it's all easily customizable.</li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>It can be used anywhere. It's a template so you work on it and change everything as you like. It only lacks API versioning by default, which can always be added by creating <code>project.api.vX.*</code> modules, that's on you. I mean the template to be easy and simple for small-to-mid-sized projects, though again, it's a template so you work on it as you wish. Certainly beginner-friendly if you know ORM and FastAPI.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>I don't know about alternatives, this is what I came up with after a few times of making projects with this stack. There's different templates out there and you have your taste, so it depends on what you like your projects to look and feel like best.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Nekidev/uv-fastapi-tortoise\">https://github.com/Nekidev/uv-fastapi-tortoise</a></p> <p>My own Git: <a href=\"https://git.nyeki.dev/templates/uv-fastapi-tortoise\">https://git.nyeki.dev/templates/uv-fastapi-tortoise</a></p> <p>All suggestions are appreciated, issues and PRs too as always.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nekogi1\"> /u/Nekogi1 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpdnxn/uv_fastapi_tortoise_orm_template/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpdnxn/uv_fastapi_tortoise_orm_template/\">[comments]</a></span>",
