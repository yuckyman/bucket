      "title": "Autistic Children Show Reduced Activity in Left Superior Temporal Cortex in Response to Social-emotional Meaning in Language",
      "content": "Background: Autistic children often exhibit challenges in social interaction, emotional processing, and language communication. While differences among autistic children in processing non-linguistic social-emotional cues compared to non-autistic pears are well-documented, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of social-emotional meaning conveyed through the language content remain unclear. In non-autistic adults, the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) are sensitive to social-emotional semantics. We investigated whether this neural sensitivity is altered in autistic children. Methods: We recruited 78 children (54 autistic and 24 non-autistic; 68 males, 10 females; mean age 10 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while listening to sentences describing either people in emotional situations (social-emotional sentences) or sentences describing non-human objects, events, or concepts (object sentences). Results: Significant activity was found in the left STG and STS in response to social-emotional sentences across both groups, but the activity was reduced in autistic children compared to non-autistic controls. No significant group difference was found during general auditory or object-sentence processing. The neural activity in the left STG and STS during social-emotional sentence processing was significantly predicted by the degree of autistic social-affective characteristics but was not predicted by general linguistic ability. Conclusions: Autistic children show reduced activity in the left STG and STS compared to non-autistic peers during social-emotional sentence processing. This reduced activity, driven by social-affective characteristics rather than general linguistic ability, may contribute to autistic children's social communication challenges.",

      "content": "Three-photon microscopy (3PM) has extended optical imaging beyond the reach of two-photon microscopy (2PM), but its practical depth remains far below theoretical predictions because of low photon efficiency and severe noise contamination. Here we present an integrated hardware and software solution that addresses these limitations. We developed a plug-and-play region-of-interest (ROI) imaging module that selectively excites neuron-occupied regions to improve power efficiency and reduce photothermal stress. The module incorporates frame-partitioned accumulative (FPA) imaging for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) structural acquisition, automated neuron segmentation, and motion-robust registration for stable recordings. Complementing this, OptiCal is a cascaded deep-learning framework that removes mixed noise including periodic, motion-induced, and random components. Together, these innovations enable high-fidelity imaging to 1.7 mm depth, extending the practical limit of 3PM by about 400 m while maintaining low excitation power. Our results reveal reliable calcium activity and behavior-correlated dynamics in deep medial prefrontal cortex of awake mice.",

      "title": "Attention modulates EEG spectral activity across serial positions",
      "content": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity has been associated with attentional processes such as task-irrelevant stimulus suppression and orienting. The aim of this study was to understand how spectral activity evolves as words are presented in a word list learning task and as multiple components of attention are engaged under multitasking demands. We recorded scalp EEG in a delayed free-recall task in which participants encoded common noun word lists either under full attention (encoding only) or divided attention (simultaneous target detection task). In the target detection task, participants pressed a response button when a word was paired with a target-colored square but not for words paired with a distractor-colored square (cue condition). Activity in the high gamma frequencies (50-100 Hz) decreased while alpha activity (8-12 Hz) increased throughout word list presentation (i.e., across serial positions), consistent with prior work demonstrating effects of cognitive load on EEG spectral power. Divided attention attenuated this change in gamma power across the list. Cue condition modulated alpha activity evenly across serial positions, with consistently lower power during target trials than distractor trials. Our findings suggest that frequency-specific characteristics of processing during list encoding may reflect multiple components of attention that vary over different time scales. Gamma frequencies capture the interactive effects of cognitive load and dual-task demands, while alpha power separately reflects gradual increases in cognitive load and momentary orienting.",

      "title": "Neural representations of beliefs in a multi-dimensional inference task",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior requires maintaining and updating probabilistic beliefs about the world, yet how distributed brain circuits implement such computations remains unknown. We recorded from over 1,400 neurons across six brain regions in monkeys performing a multi-dimensional inference task requiring them to infer hidden rules through trial-and-error learning. Behavior was well-described by models based on Bayesian updating of beliefs over rule features. Neural representations of both observable variables (stimuli, rewards) and latent beliefs (rule preferences, confidence) were broadly distributed across hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, striatum, and inferior temporal cortex. Belief representations were present throughout all task periods but exhibited region- and epoch-specific dynamics. Critically, trial-to-trial changes in population activity reflected Bayesian belief updating: neural responses evolved according to the integration of prior beliefs with new evidence. Additionally, we identified confidence representations that were independent of specific beliefs and showed distinct temporal profiles. These results demonstrate that probabilistic inference emerges from coordinated dynamics across distributed brain systems, with different regions contributing flexibly according to computational demands at different states of learning and decision-making.",

      "title": "Anxiety Selectively Impairs Reward Learning Under Uncertainty, While N3 Sleep Recalibrates It",
      "content": "Adapting to uncertain environments requires distinguishing stochastic variability from genuine environmental change, yet how anxiety and sleep shape this process remains unclear. Using a probabilistic reversal-learning task that simultaneously manipulated stochasticity and volatility, we show that high trait anxiety selectively impairs reward learning in stable but noisy environments, despite preserved sensitivity to true volatility. Computational modeling revealed that anxious individuals misattribute stochastic fluctuations to environmental change, resulting in elevated reward learning rates and impaired evidence accumulation. In a second experiment combining task performance with overnight sleep EEG, greater N3 sleep was associated with reduced learning rates and improved evidence accumulation. These findings identify a selective computational mechanism underlying anxiety-related learning deficits and suggest N3 sleep as a state-dependent pathway for recalibrating adaptive learning under uncertainty.",

      "title": "Membrane potential dynamics of peripheral cold-sensitive neurons in Drosophila larvae",
      "content": "Drosophila larvae sense diverse external stimuli through peripheral multidendritic (md) sensory neurons, among which Class III (CIII) neurons are essential for detecting noxious cold temperatures. Previous extracellular recordings showed that CIII neurons produce a characteristic phasic-tonic response to cold: a transient high-frequency spiking phase, during which about half of the neurons burst, followed by frequency adaptation. Here, we report the first intracellular recordings from CIII neurons, allowing us to characterize the membrane potential dynamics underlying their cold-evoked spiking responses. At rest, CIII neurons showed membrane potential fluctuations that occasionally triggered sporadic spikes. Cold stimulation induced a sustained depolarization that evoked a train of spikes, with spike rates peaking at 2-12 spikes/s within the first 5 s, followed by a gradual decline. About half of the neurons exhibited occasional bursts, in which clusters of 2-6 spikes at 10-120 Hz superimposed on a brief depolarizing hump. Cold stimulation also increased input resistance and amplified electrotonically spreading spikes, suggesting enhanced electrotonic signaling from distal sites via an increased space constant. Together, these findings provide key insights into the electrophysiological mechanisms of sensory encoding in peripheral neurons and establish a framework for dissecting the ionic and structural mechanisms of cold transduction.",

      "content": "Stress profoundly impacts systemic metabolism, yet the central circuits linking stress responses to peripheral metabolic regulation remain poorly defined. Here, we identify the preBotzinger complex (preBotC), a brainstem breathing rhythm generator, as a key stress-responsive hub coordinating metabolic adaptations. Using viral tracing, we show that preBotC neurons project to brown adipose tissue and liver, and that a subset of these projection neurons expresses the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor PAC1R, positioning PACAP signaling as a critical modulator of this circuit. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed robust preBotC activation under stress, while spatial transcriptomics demonstrated altered neuronal metabolic circuitry in preBotC following PAC1R ablation. PAC1R knockdown in preBotC combined with stress resulted in blunted respiratory rhythmicity, reduced sympathetic innervation, and suppression of energy expenditure and lipid metabolic pathways in brown fat, while reprogramming hepatic transcriptional networks toward amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. These findings define a unique neuropeptidergic brainstem periphery circuit integrating stress, respiration, and metabolism.",

      "title": "MyoGen: Unified Biophysical Modeling of Human Neuromotor Activity and Resulting Signals",
      "content": "Understanding human motor control requires integrating cortical and spinal cord activity, muscle mechanics, and electrophysiology, levels that are often studied separately. We present MyoGen, an open-source framework that unifies spinal circuitry, proprioceptive feedback, musculotendon dynamics, cortical activity, and multimodal electromyography (EMG) generation in a single, interoperable platform. Spinal motor neurons and the resulting motor unit (MU) action potentials represent the only neural cells that can be accessed at scale in humans. We used human MU ensembles to validate our model across a wide range of experimental conditions. Using data-driven optimization, we found that MyoGen produces MU population activity that closely matches experimental discharge-rate distributions and discharge variability across human muscles. Moreover, it generates decomposable surface and intramuscular EMG, reproduces beta-band modulation of descending drive and its nonlinear transformation into force, and implements complete sensorimotor loops. Dimensionality reduction of simulated agonist-antagonist EMG reveals low-dimensional control manifolds consistent with experimental recordings from both healthy and spinal cord injured individuals. MyoGen provides physiologically grounded, ground-truth data and integrates seamlessly with analysis pipelines, enabling systematic investigation of motor control principles, validation of signal-processing algorithms, and exploration of sensorimotor interactions that are experimentally inaccessible.",

      "title": "Dorsal striatal dopamine integrates sensory and reward prediction errors to guide perceptual decisions",
      "content": "Perceptual decisions are shaped by expectations about sensory stimuli and rewards, learned through sensory and reward prediction errors. Dopamine is known to convey reward prediction errors that shape perceptual decisions. However, whether dopamine also signals sensory prediction errors during perceptual decision-making remains unknown. We recorded dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of mice performing a visual decision-making task while manipulating sensory and reward expectations. The two manipulations produced similar behavioral biases but elicited opposite dopamine signals, indicating that dopamine within the same striatal region encoded both sensory and reward prediction errors. Sensory prediction error signaling was specific to dopamine as striatal acetylcholine showed no such error signals. Optogenetically stimulating striatal dopamine at stimulus onset biased subsequent perceptual decisions, consistent with updating sensory expectations. A computational model learning from both sensory and reward prediction errors captured behavioral biases and dopamine data, revealing distinct but spatially overlapping dopaminergic teaching signals.",

      "title": "Versatile Learning without Synaptic Plasticity in a Spiking Neural Network",
      "content": "Learning in the brain's cerebral cortex is widely attributed to synaptic plasticity among cortical neurons. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that alternative processes, such as modulation of intrinsic excitability or gating by subcortical inputs, may also serve as important learning mechanisms. We developed the Bias Adaptive Neural Firing Framework (BANFF) as a simplified model of such phenomena embodied by a learnable bias current for each neuron of a rate-based network. Here, we extend this framework to spiking neural networks. We show that learning such biases enables one recurrent spiking neural network with fixed and random synaptic weights to perform well on nine tasks spanning classification, regression, and closed-loop dynamical systems mimicry. The network learnt a unique bias set for each task, and unlike recurrent synapse-based learning, new learning did not interfere with previous learning. The network was robust to non-stationary F-I curves (spike frequency adaptation), and biases could be learned with a learning algorithm (e-prop) that is more biologically plausible than stock gradient descent. Overall, we show that the BANFF can be extended from rate-based to spiking neural networks, maintaining good multi-task performance with a single network of spiking neurons.",
