This does 2 things: 1. obfuscates the code, 2. lets you do all sorts of wacky formatting. This isn't really useful for anything besides making ASCII art, but I think it's pretty fun. It supports almost all of Python's syntax with a few exceptions (match statements, async functions). </p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>People who enjoy making ASCII art or obfuscated programs</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>As far as I know, there are no similar projects that exist.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What my project does?</h1> <p>I've been working in a monorepo managed with a <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/\">uv workspace</a> and ran into an annoying issue. When you build and publish an internal library that depends on another workspace member, the resulting wheel has no version constraint on that internal dependency.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada\">Cada</a> is a small hatchling plugin that fixes this. Cada resolves uv workspace members' versions at build time and adds proper version constraints to internal dependencies. You can choose different strategies: pin to exact version, allow patch updates, semver-style, etc.</p> <p>```toml [build-system] requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;, &quot;hatch-cada&quot;] build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;</p> <p>[project] name = &quot;my-client&quot; dependencies = [&quot;my-core&quot;]</p> <p>[tool.uv.sources] my-core = { workspace = true }</p> <p>[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.cada] strategy = &quot;allow-all-updates&quot; ```</p> <p>With the above configuration, the built wheel will declare a dependency on my-core&gt;=1.2.3. That way, you keep unversioned dependencies during development and get proper constraints automatically when you publish.</p> <h1>What is the intended audience?</h1> <p>This is for anyone distributing Python libraries from a uv workspace to PyPI (or any registry) to consumers outside of the workspace.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/carderne/una\"><strong>Una</strong></a> bundles all workspace dependencies into a single wheel. Great for applications you deploy yourself (Docker images, Lambda functions, CLI tools). Cada takes the opposite approach: each package keeps its own version and release cycle. It's meant for distributing libraries to users outside of the monorepo.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Opentrons/hatch-plugins/tree/main/hatch-dependency-coversion\"><strong>hatch-dependency-coversion</strong></a> rewrites dependency versions to match the current package's version (lockstep versioning). Cada resolves each dependency's actual version independently, each package can have it's own release cycle, but it also supports lockstep versioning if you want to. Cada simply reads your packages versions and does not make assumptions on your versioning strategy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/ninoseki/uv-dynamic-versioning\"><strong>uv-dynamic-versioning</strong></a> requires moving dependencies to a non-standard location with templating syntax. Cada keeps standard project.dependencies, so tools like Dependabot, pip-audit, and monorepo build tools (Nx, Moon) keep working out of the box.</p> <p>It's a narrow use case but happy to hear feedback or answer questions if some of you find it useful.</p> <p>Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada\"> https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada </a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bOmrani\"> /u/bOmrani </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q01ayz/cada_a_build_plugin_for_publishing_interdependent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q01ayz/cada_a_build_plugin_for_publishing_interdependent/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.
