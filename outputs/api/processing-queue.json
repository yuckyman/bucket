      "title": "Netrun Systems releases 10 Open Source interconnected Python packages for FastAPI",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>The Netrun Service Library is a collection of 10 MIT-licensed Python packages designed for FastAPI applications. Each package solves a common enterprise problem:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th>Package</th> <th>Function</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-auth</strong></td> <td>JWT authentication + Casbin RBAC + multi-tenant isolation</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-logging</strong></td> <td>Structlog-based logging with automatic redaction of passwords/tokens</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-config</strong></td> <td>Azure Key Vault integration with TTL caching and Pydantic Settings</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-errors</strong></td> <td>Exception hierarchy mapped to HTTP status codes with correlation IDs</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-cors</strong></td> <td>OWASP-compliant CORS middleware</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-db-pool</strong></td> <td>Async SQLAlchemy connection pooling with health checks</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-llm</strong></td> <td>Multi-provider LLM orchestration (Azure OpenAI, Ollama, Claude, Gemini)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-env</strong></td> <td>Schema-based environment variable validation CLI</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-pytest-fixtures</strong></td> <td>Unified test fixtures for all packages</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>netrun-ratelimit</strong></td> <td>Token bucket rate limiting with Redis backend</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>The packages use a &quot;soft dependency&quot; pattern: they detect each other at runtime and integrate automatically. Install <code>netrun-logging</code> and all other packages use it for structured logging. Don't install it? They fall back to stdlib logging. This lets you use packages individually or as a cohesive ecosystem.</p> <p><strong>Quick example:</strong></p> <p>```python from netrun_auth import JWTAuthenticator, require_permission from netrun_logging import get_logger from netrun_config import AzureKeyVaultConfig</p> <p>logger = get<em>logger(</em><em>name</em>_) auth = JWTAuthenticator() config = AzureKeyVaultConfig()</p> <p>@app.get(&quot;/admin/users&quot;) @require_permission(&quot;users:read&quot;) async def list_users(user = Depends(auth.get_current_user)): logger.info(&quot;listing_users&quot;, user_id=user.id) return await get_users() ```</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>These packages are intended for <strong>production use</strong> in FastAPI applications, particularly:</p> <ul> <li>Developers building multi-tenant SaaS platforms</li> <li>Teams needing enterprise patterns (RBAC, audit logging, secrets management)</li> <li>Projects requiring multiple LLM provider support with fallback</li> <li>Anyone tired of writing the same auth/logging/config boilerplate</li> </ul> <p>I've been using them in production for internal enterprise platforms. They're stable and have 346+ passing tests across the library.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p><strong>vs. individual solutions (python-jose, structlog, etc.):</strong> These packages bundle best practices and wire everything together. Instead of configuring structlog manually, <code>netrun-logging</code> gives you sensible defaults with automatic sensitive field redaction. The soft dependency pattern means packages enhance each other when co-installed.</p> <p><strong>vs. FastAPI-Users:</strong> <code>netrun-auth</code> focuses on JWT + Casbin policy-based RBAC rather than database-backed user models. It's designed for services where user management lives elsewhere (Azure AD, Auth0, etc.) but you need fine-grained permission control.</p> <p><strong>vs. LangChain for LLM:</strong> <code>netrun-llm</code> is much lighter\u00e2\u20ac\u201djust provider abstraction and fallback logic. No chains, agents, or memory systems. If your provider is down, it fails over to the next one. That's it.</p> <p><strong>vs. writing it yourself:</strong> Each package represents patterns extracted from real production code. The auth package alone handles JWT validation, Casbin RBAC, multi-tenant isolation, and integrates with the logging package for audit trails.</p> <h2>Links</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Source Code</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/netrun-systems/netrun-oss\">https://github.com/netrun-systems/netrun-oss</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI</strong>: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/search/?q=netrun\">https://pypi.org/search/?q=netrun</a></li> <li><strong>Install</strong>: <code>pip install netrun-auth netrun-logging netrun-config</code></li> </ul> <h2>Feedback Welcome</h2> <ol> <li>Is the soft dependency pattern the right approach vs. hard dependencies?</li> <li>The LLM provider abstraction supports 5 providers with automatic fallback\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmissing any major ones?</li> <li>Edge cases in the auth package I should handle?</li> </ol> <p>MIT licensed.

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I built Mephisto because I was frustrated with the current state of disposable email services\u2014most are riddled with intrusive ads, trackers, and captchas.<p>I wanted a tool that felt like a proper developer utility rather than a spam farm.<p>The stack is React, Vite, and Tailwind. Key architectural decisions:<p>1. Volatile Memory: The backend writes nothing to disk. Once a session terminates, the data is irretrievable.\n2. Client-Side Entropy: The password generator runs locally in the browser; keys are never sent to the server.\n3. PWA: It's installable and designed for low latency using WebSockets for incoming mail (no polling).\n4. Mobile Handoff: You can transfer an active session to mobile via an encrypted QR code.<p>It is completely free and open for public use. I'd love to hear your feedback on the implementation and UI.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46300047\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46300047</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>",
