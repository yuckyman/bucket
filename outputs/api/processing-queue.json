Well, in fact they are still there, but the peak was at around 9 am European Time.</p> <p>Because I just &quot;rejoined&quot; the academic workforce after working in industry for 6 years, I was thinking it is a good time to post something I am currently working on: a space mission instrument that will go to the active asteroid (3200) Phaethon! Ok, I am not posting (for now) my actual work, but I wanted to share with you the astro-dynamical ideas that are behind the scientific conclusion that the Geminids are related to this asteroid.</p> <p>The parameter that allows us to compute dynamical relation is the so called &quot;D_SH&quot; parameter from 1963! And in a short tutorial I explain this parameter and its usage in a Python script. Maybe someone of you wants to learn something about our cosmic vicinity using Python :)?</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/txjo_bNAOrc?si=HLeZ3c3D2-QI7ESf\">https://youtu.be/txjo_bNAOrc?si=HLeZ3c3D2-QI7ESf</a></p> <p>And the correspoding code: <a href=\"https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/CompressedCosmos/CompressedCosmos_Geminids_and_Phaethon.ipynb\">https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/CompressedCosmos/CompressedCosmos_Geminids_and_Phaethon.ipynb</a></p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Thomas</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas\"> /u/MrAstroThomas </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmdshy/the_geminids_meteors_the_active_asteroids/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmdshy/the_geminids_meteors_the_active_asteroids/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Contextual associations impact visual search across multiple processing stages",
      "content": "Growing evidence indicates that visual search is influenced not only by perceptual but also by semantic information. Among such semantic influences, categorical effects have been extensively studied. By contrast, the influence of contextual associations, that is, how objects commonly co-occur within specific scene contexts, remains less understood. Here, we orthogonally manipulated contextual and categorical relationships between target and distractor objects in a visual search task, while controlling for perceptual target-distractor similarity. By applying linear regression analyses, we modelled behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) from contextual, categorical, and perceptual target-distractor similarity. We found that contextual associations guide attention independently during early processing (modulating the N1pc ERP component), subsequently interact with categorical information (modulating the N2pc), and ultimately shape behavioral search performance jointly with perceptual and categorical similarity. These findings demonstrate that contextual object associations influence visual search across multiple processing stages, thereby supporting attentional guidance in everyday visual tasks.",
