      "title": "Beta2* Nicotinic Receptors Tune Prefrontal Behavior Through Distinct Neuronal Populations",
      "content": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing beta2 subunit (beta2* nAChRs) are widely expressed in the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC), where they regulate behavioral and cognitive domains associated with this region and represent potential therapeutic targets for neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, current pharmacological tools cannot distinguish among receptors expressed by different neuronal populations, and the functional roles of beta2* nAChRs in specific neuronal types remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the expression and behavioral significance of beta2* nAChRs in distinct neuronal populations of the mouse PFC. We first used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze the expression of the beta2 nicotinic subunit in major neuronal types and cortical layers. We then used CRISPR to knock down (KD) the beta2 subunit in two PFC populations and, for comparison, in a striatal population. KD of the beta2 subunit in deep-layer PFC neurons defined by neuropeptide Y (NPY) expression specifically altered working memory and exploratory behavior and affected social and anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, KD in PFC interneurons expressing serotonin receptor 5HT3a led to a hypersocial phenotype. KD of beta2* nAChRs in a rare NPY-expressing striatal population resulted in subtler and largely opposing changes in similar behavioral domains. These findings show that beta2* nAChRs expressed by distinct neuronal populations contribute differentially, and sometimes oppositely, to behavioral regulation. Our data suggest that cell-type- and region-specific expression of beta2* nAChRs is required for the modulation and fine-tuning of behavioral domains relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Over-Reliance on Prior Expectations in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis",
      "content": "Cognitive impairment is a common and disabling feature of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bayesian models of perception and action provide a powerful framework to better understand how cognitive processes are altered in MS. In this study, we employed a time reproduction paradigm within a Bayesian framework to investigate the underlying mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in patients with relapsing-remitting MS. We applied a modified Bayesian observer model, which partitions time reproduction into three stages: sensory measurement, time estimation, and motor response. We found that both MS and control groups showed a systematic bias in reproducing time, overestimating short intervals and underestimating long intervals. This bias was significantly larger in patients with MS compared with controls, reflecting an over-reliance on prior expectations relative to sensory-motor information. Computational modeling indicated that this increased bias in the MS group was driven by greater measurement noise during the sensory stage. Moreover, central tendency bias increases with age in healthy participants as reliance on prior expectations becomes stronger than sensory-motor evidence. Interestingly, we found that this age-related effect on bias was absent in patients with MS. Further analysis showed both younger and older patients performed equally biased, and their performance was similar to older healthy participants.",

      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

      "content": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM)\u2014quantum theory applications outside of physics\u2014are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose, as well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not only concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also with QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT)\u2014a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical \u201coscillatory cognition\u201d of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, that is, \u201cmental entanglement.\u201d We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing \u201clocal observables\u201d and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on \u201cmental entanglement\u201d detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",
