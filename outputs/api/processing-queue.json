      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
      "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

      "title": "Altered Molecular Composition of a Specific Subset of Prefrontal Cortical Excitatory Synapses in Schizophrenia",
      "content": "<p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects. Our study provides the first comprehensive comparison of key functionally relevant synaptic proteins in individual human excitatory synapses and demonstrates that changes in the molecular composition of only a specific subset of excitatory synapses may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>",

      "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Language Information Representation within the Left Inferior Parietal Lobule Network: An Intracranial SEEG Study",
      "content": "<p>The left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) supports diverse cognitive functions through the finely differentiated yet coordinated interactions of its subregions, including the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lbIPS). However, how these subregions dynamically represent and exchange information during cognitive processing remains unclear. Language processing, integrating visual form, phonology, and semantics provide an ideal model for investigating the IPL's functional capabilities and dynamics. To overcome the limitations of traditional neuroimaging techniques that lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture these fast-evolving processes and univariate analyses unable to detect fine-grained representational structure in neural signals, we employed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 13 epilepsy patients (eight males and five females) performing an oral word reading task. Combining SEEG with representational similarity analysis (RSA), a multivariate approach linking neural activity patterns to cognitive models, we mapped spatiotemporal language information dynamics across IPL subregions. Results revealed dynamic functional differentiation within the left IPL: the SMG and AG exhibited sequential language representations, with the SMG showing early semantics, followed by phonology and later visual form and semantics; the AG showed early semantics followed by visual form; in contrast, the lbIPS was engaged only in visual form representation. Connectivity analyses revealed the dynamic coordination among IPL subregions throughout the task. These findings demonstrate that the left IPL operates as a dynamic network, where functional specialization and interregional information exchange collectively support complex cognitive processes.</p>",
