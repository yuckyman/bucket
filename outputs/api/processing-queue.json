      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted a reservation system web app for my apartment building's amenities, but the available open source solutions were too complicated, so <a href=\"https://github.com/joshhubert-dsp/reserve-it\">I built my own</a>. Ended up turning it into a lightweight framework, implemented as a mkdocs plugin to abuse mkdocs/material as a frontend build tool. So you get the full aesthetic customization capababilities those provide. I call it... <strong>Reserve-It!</strong></p> <p>It just requires a dedicated Google account for the app, since it uses Google Calendar for persistent calendar stores.</p> <ul> <li>You make a calendar for each independently reservable resource (like say a single tennis court) and bundle multiple interchangeable resources (multiple tennis courts) into one form page interface.</li> <li>Users' confirmation emails are really just Gcal events the app account invites them to. Users can opt to receive event reminders, which are just Gcal event updates in a trenchcoat triggered N minutes before.</li> <li>Users don't need accounts, just an email address. A minimal sqlite database stores addresses that have made reservations, and each one can only hold one reservation at a time. Users can cancel their events and reschedule.</li> <li>You can add additional custom form inputs for a shared password you disseminate on community communication channels, or any additional validation your heart desires. Custom validation just requires subclassing a provided pydantic model.</li> </ul> <p>You define reservable resources in a directory full of yaml files like this:</p> <pre><code># resource page title name: Tennis Courts # displayed along with title emoji: \ud83c\udfbe # resource page subtitle description: Love is nothing. # the google calendar ids for each individual tennis court, and their hex colors for the # embedded calendar view. calendars: CourtA: id: longhexstring1@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#AA0000&quot; CourtB: id: longhexstring2@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#00AA00&quot; CourtC: id: longhexstring3@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#0000AA&quot; day_start_time: 8:00 AM day_end_time: 8:00 PM # the granularity of available reservations, here it's every hour from 8 to 8. minutes_increment: 60 # the maximum allowed reservation length maximum_minutes: 180 # users can choose whether to receive an email reminder minutes_before_reminder: 60 # how far in advance users are allowed to make reservations maximum_days_ahead: 14 # users can indicate whether they're willing to share a resource with others, adds a # checkbox to the form if true allow_shareable: true # Optionally, add additional custom form fields to this resource reservation webpage, on # top of the ones defined in app-config.yaml custom_form_fields: - type: number name: ntrp label: NTRP Rating required: True # Optionally, specify a path to a descriptive image for this resource, displayed on the # form webpage. Must be a path relative to resource-configs dir. image: path: courts.jpg caption: court map pixel_width: 800 </code></pre> <p>Each one maps to a form webpage built for that resource, which looks like <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshhubert-dsp/reserve-it/refs/heads/main/form-page.png\">this</a>.</p> <p>I'm gonna go ahead and call myself a bootleg full stack developer now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mediocre_Musician889\"> /u/Mediocre_Musician889 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcfa2a/a_deadsimple_reservation_web_app_framework/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcfa2a/a_deadsimple_reservation_web_app_framework/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Time Cells in the Human Brain Support Working Memory Maintenance",
      "content": "Working memory (WM), the active retention of information over short periods, is a fundamental cognitive function, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In rodents, cue-selective \"time cells\" fire at specific timepoints after a WM memory cue, collectively forming sequences that encode cue-memory and elapsed time, providing a temporal code for maintaining information across time intervals. Whether similar dynamics support WM in the human brain is unknown. Here, we analyzed intracranial single-neuron recordings from medial frontal and medial temporal regions of patients performing a WM task. We found time cells with temporally tuned activation during WM maintenance, collectively forming robust sequences that tiled a delay period. Time-cell coordination in the hippocampus predicted successful WM maintenance, whereas in the pre-supplementary motor area it reflected memory load. Furthermore, we identified distributed cue-selective time cells that encoded both the identity of a memorandum and elapsed maintenance time, providing a temporally structured mnemonic code that complements persistent firing of concept cells. Together, these findings establish time-cell sequences as a conserved neural mechanism supporting human working memory.",
