      "title": "Show HN: BrowserOS \u2013 \"Claude Cowork\" in the browser",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Nithin and Nikhil, twin brothers building BrowserOS (YC S24). We're an open-source, privacy-first alternative to the AI browsers from big labs.<p>The big differentiator: on BrowserOS you can use local LLMs or BYOK and run the agent entirely on the client side, so your company/sensitive data stays on your machine!<p>Today we're launching filesystem access... just like Claude Cowork, our browser agent can read files, write files, run shell commands! But honestly, we didn't plan for this. It turns out the privacy decision we made 9 months ago accidentally positioned us for this moment.<p>--- The architectural bet we made 9 months ago<p>Unlike other AI browsers (ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet) where the agent loop runs server-side, we decided early on to run our agent entirely on your machine (client side).<p>But building everything on the client side wasn't smooth.<p>We initially built our agent loop inside a Chrome extension. But we kept hitting walls:<p>1) JS service worker is single-threaded, so we couldn't start multiple agents in parallel.<p>2) Not having access to a NodeJS-like runtime meant we couldn't use many great npm packages (Vercel AI SDK, etc)<p>So we made the hard decision 2 months ago to throw away everything we built and start from scratch.<p>In the new architecture, our agent loop sits in a standalone binary that we ship alongside our Chromium. And we use gemini-cli for the agent loop with some tweaks! We wrote a neat adapter to translate between Gemini format and Vercel AI SDK format. You can look at our entire codebase here: <a href=\"https://git.new/browseros-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://git.new/browseros-agent</a><p>--- How we gave browser access to filesystem<p>When Claude Cowork launched, we realized something: because Atlas and Comet run their agent loop server-side, there's no good way for their agent to access your files without uploading them to the server first.<p>But our agent was already local. Adding filesystem access meant just... opening the door (with your permissions ofc). Our agent can now read and write files just like Claude Code.<p>--- What you can actually do today<p>a) Organize files in my desktop folder <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NOZ7xjto6Uc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/NOZ7xjto6Uc</a><p>b) Open top 5 HN links, extract the details and write summary into a HTML file <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uXvqs_TCmMQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/uXvqs_TCmMQ</a><p>--- Where we are now\nIf you haven't tried us since the last Show HN, give us another shot. The new architecture unlocked a ton of new features, and we've grown to 8.5K GitHub stars and 100K+ downloads:<p>c) You can now build more reliable workflows using n8n-like graph <a href=\"https://youtu.be/H_bFfWIevSY\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/H_bFfWIevSY</a><p>d) You can also use BrowserOS as an MCP server in Cursor or Claude Code <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5nevh00lckM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/5nevh00lckM</a><p>e) You can also schedule repetitive tasks!<p>--- Why we think browser is the right platform<p>We are very bullish on browser being the right platform for a Claude Cowork like agent. Browser is the most commonly used app by knowledge workers (emails, docs, spreadsheets, research, etc). And even Anthropic recognizes this -- for Claude Cowork, they have janky integration with browser via a chrome extension. But owning the entire stack allows us to build differentiated features that wouldn't be possible otherwise. One example: Browser ACLs.<p>Agents can do dumb or destructive things, so we're adding browser-level guardrails (think IAM for agents): \"role(agent): can never click buy\" or \"role(agent): read-only access on my bank's homepage.\" We have a prototype already\u2014curious to hear your take on this and the overall thesis.<p>We\u2019ll be in the comments.

      "title": "A genetically defined midbrain-pontine circuit gates vocal communication",
      "content": "Vocal communication is selectively expressed in social and emotional contexts, suggesting the presence of neural substrates that gate the conversion of internal states into vocal motor output. Although the periaqueductal gray (PAG) is known to be essential for vocalization, the genetic identity and circuit logic of the neurons that initiate and shape vocal signals remain unclear. Here, we identify a genetically defined population of somatostatin-expressing neurons in the lateral and ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG SST ) that functions as a premotor gate for ultrasonic vocalizations in mice. In vivo calcium imaging shows that l/vlPAG SST neurons are selectively recruited around vocal onset. Manipulating l/vlPAG SST neuron activity bidirectionally regulates vocal output: activation prolongs call duration by coordinating respiratory, laryngeal, and orofacial motor programs, whereas silencing suppresses courtship vocalizations. Projection specific manipulations further demonstrate that descending glutamatergic, but not neuropeptidergic, output from l/vlPAG SST neurons to the dorsal pontine tegmentum is sufficient to drive vocal production. Together, these findings define a genetically specified midbrain pontine circuit that gates vocal communication and provides prospective access for linking internal conditions to vocal expressions.",

I'm trying to get familiar with using the default structures that 'uv init' provides with it's --lib/--package/--app flags.</p> <p>The most relevant official documentation I can find is the following, with respect to creating a --lib (library):<br /> <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/#workspace-layouts\">https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/#workspace-layouts</a></p> <p>Assuming you are making a library (libroot) with two sub-packages (pkg1, pkg2) each with a respective module (modulea.py and moduleb.py). There are two approaches, I'm curious which people feel makes the most sense and why?</p> <p>Approach 1 is essentially what is outlined in the link above, but you have to make the 'libroot\\packages' sub dir manually, it's not as though uv does that automatically.</p> <p>Approach 2 is more in keeping with my understanding of how one is meant to structure sub-packages when using the src directory structure for packaging, but maybe I have misunderstood the convention?</p> <p><strong>APPROACH 1:</strong></p> <pre><code>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500libroot \u2502 .gitignore \u2502 .python-version \u2502 pyproject.toml \u2502 README.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500packages \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg1 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 pyproject.toml \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 README.md \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500src \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg1 \u2502 \u2502 modulea.py \u2502 \u2502 __init__.py \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg2 \u2502 \u2502 pyproject.toml \u2502 \u2502 README.md \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500src \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg2 \u2502 moduleb.py \u2502 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500src \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500libroot py.typed __init__.py </code></pre> <p><strong>APPROACH 2:</strong></p> <pre><code>\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500libroot \u2502 .gitignore \u2502 .python-version \u2502 pyproject.toml \u2502 README.md \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500src \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500libroot \u2502 py.typed \u2502 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg1 \u2502 \u2502 pyproject.toml \u2502 \u2502 README.md \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500src \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg1 \u2502 modulea.py \u2502 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg2 \u2502 pyproject.toml \u2502 README.md \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500src \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500pkg2 moduleb.py __init__.py </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LazyLichen\"> /u/LazyLichen </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjk4ip/python_packaging_library_directory_structure_when/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjk4ip/python_packaging_library_directory_structure_when/\">[comments]</a></span>",
