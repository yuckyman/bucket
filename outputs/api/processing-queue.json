      "title": "The fos homolog kayak is required for adult eye formation and function in Drosophila",
      "content": "This study characterizes the requirements of the kayak (kay) gene in Drosophila melanogaster adult eye biology by examining mutant phenotypes in photoreceptor development, external eye morphology, corneal and bristle ultrastructure, and visually guided behaviors, such as phototaxis, in kay strong loss-of-function homozygous mutant clones. Despite previous studies on kay, there is a dearth of phenotypic characterization of the morphological and behavioral consequences of kay loss-of-function alleles in the adult eye. We find that kay is expressed in developing ommatidia in eye discs. The kay mutant ommatidia are misaligned, lack photoreceptors, have malformed corneal surfaces, and have misshaped, misplaced, and fewer mechanosensory bristles. Corneal nipples, while present in mutant corneas on the corneal surface, are disorganized and malformed. With an average of 30% of the eye territory mutant, flies have a significantly lower response in a behavioral phototaxis assay. Altogether, kay function is required for multiple cell types in the adult retina, and this stands in stark contrast with other jun kinase genes, like the fly homologs of jun kinase and jun, genes not required for adult eye morphogenesis. This is consistent with Kayak functions that are independent of heterodimerizing with Jun proteins or requiring activation of the jun kinase pathway.",

      "title": "Minimally verbal children with autism may see the global, but point local: A behavioral and eye-tracking study in visual perceptual processing",
      "content": "Recent work suggests that pointing based assessments may underestimate or mischaracterize perceptual and cognitive abilities in minimally verbal autism (mvASD). Extending this line of work, we address the classic global local question by testing whether mvASD children access global visual structur and whether it is consistently expressed in behavior using Kanizsa illusory contours (KIC) and circular colinear contours (CC). Typically developing (TD) and mvASD children viewed KIC and CC stimuli on a touchscreen while spontaneous eye gaze and pointing were recorded. Participants also completed a goal directed drag and drop matching task that required selecting the solid shape corresponding to the global KIC configuration. In spontaneous responses, mvASD children were more drawn to local elements (e.g., individual inducers, the CC frame, single Gabors) and showed less centralized responding than TD peers. Notably, CC pointing was often anchored to one half of the contour regardless of contour screen location, suggesting object centered global selection. Also, in the drag and drop task, approx. 90% of mvASD participants performed above chance in at least one condition and half performed at ceiling, demonstrating accurate global matching. These findings suggest that global structure is available in mvASD but may be underweighted in spontaneous response selection under ambiguity, consistent with the Affordance Competition Hypothesis and ambiguity resolution accounts.",

The explanatory scope of Klein et al.

But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources.

      "title": "NEuRT: A Transformer-Based Model for Explainable Neuronal Activity Analysis",
      "content": "The study of neuronal activity is essential for understanding brain function and its alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. Advances in in vivo imaging have enabled real-time observation of neuronal dynamics, but classical statistical methods struggle to capture the complex, time-dependent interactions within neuronal networks. Machine learning offers promising solutions for analyzing high-dimensional neuronal data, yet their application in neuroscience remains limited. Here, we introduce NEuRT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model adapted for neuronal activity analysis. NEuRT leverages self-attention mechanisms to interpret complex neuronal interactions, providing insights into patterns that traditional methods may overlook. Pre-trained on the recently introduced large annotated dataset MICrONS for signal reconstruction, NeuRT demonstrates strong generalization, effectively reconstructing activity from both visual cortex two-photon and hippocampal miniature fluorescence microscopy. Built on the BERT architecture, the NEuRT model can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. We showcase its application in classifying wild-type and transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice, based on hippocampal activity, revealing group-specific features through attention map analysis. By reducing reliance on extensive labeled data, addressing a critical challenge in neuroscience, NEuRT bridges fundamental neuroscience and disease research, offering a robust framework for AI-driven and explainable neuronal activity analysis.",

      "title": "Alteration of empathy-related behaviors in two strains of mice expressing mutations of the \u03b15 cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit",
      "content": "Human genetic association studies have linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the alpha5 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to an increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and schizophrenia. We used transgenic mice expressing either the SNP rs16969968 (termed 5SNP or 5KI) or a knockout of the Chrna5 gene (5KO) to investigate the role of 5-containing nAChRs (5*nAChRs) in emotion recognition and prosocial, rescuing-like behavioral tasks. We found that 5KO mice are impaired in the recognition of a negative affective state in a familiar peer, and displayed severely altered pro-social, altruistic behaviors, eventually assaulting peers in distress. In contrast, 5KI mice exhibited normal or improved emotion recognition and increased rescuing-like behavior. Importantly, effects of 5 mutations on emotion recognition were modulated by sex. These results demonstrate the critical implication of 5*nAChRs in emotion recognition and prosocial behaviors, revealing, sex-dependent patterns of these social emotional deficits in 5KI and 5KO mice. The current study also supports the view that 5KI and 5KO may provide a valuable preclinical model of Type I (female 5KI mice), and Type II (male 5KO mice) behavioral profiles of AUD.",

Some include some arbitrary text.</p> <p>Two I'd like to point out that I found just in the last few minutes:</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/iris-sdk/\">iris-sdk 0.1.13</a> has a license: <strong>Nobody can use this</strong></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/pyscreeps-arena/\">pyscreeps-arena 0.5.8.8</a> has a license: <strong>Apache Licence 2.0</strong> (the word license having a typo)</p></li> </ul> <p>This seems like a problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/szabgab\"> /u/szabgab </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qch5cv/licenses_on_pypi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qch5cv/licenses_on_pypi/\">[comments]</a></span>",
