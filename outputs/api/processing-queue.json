      "title": "Genetic dissection of microglia cannibalism reveals an IL10 signaling axis controls microglia lifespan",
      "content": "The development of complex organs, like the brain, demands a robust system for tissue remodeling and cellular debris clearance. In the brain, this function is performed by microglia, which must clear diverse debris substrates, including that caused by cell death. Although the subsequent fate of these phagocytic microglia is a critical regulatory point that impacts whether the brain resolves a debris environment, the genetic mechanisms that control microglia fate after debris clearance remain mostly unknown. To address this, we conducted a large-scale CRISPR screen in zebrafish using a custom-built robotic confocal microscope. We selected candidate genes from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of embryonic mouse microglia. This screen identified several modulators of microglial lifespan and cannibalism that are enriched in mouse and zebrafish microglia, including interleukin-10 receptor beta (il10rb), a receptor subunit for the cytokine IL10. Perturbation of il10, il10rb, and downstream signaling molecules JAK/STAT in zebrafish reduced microglial death. Expression analysis in mouse and zebrafish confirmed that microglia express both il10 and il10rb. Given the established role of IL10 in lysosomal remodeling, we hypothesized that it regulates microglial survival through lysosomal acidification. While il10rb perturbation did not alter lysosome number or size, it caused a significant reduction in LysoTracker-positive lysosomes, indicating decreased lysosomal acidification. Inhibiting v-ATPase also reduced microglial death, reinforcing the link between lysosomal pH and cell fate. Our findings reveal a cytokine-regulated mechanism where lysosomal dynamics determine the survival of phagocytic microglia. We propose that a necroptosis-cannibalism process functions as a quality control mechanism for microglial turnover, which is critical for refining neuroimmune cell function in the brain.",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Dissociation between physical reasoning and tool use in individuals with left hemisphere brain damage",
      "content": "Many everyday tasks, from chopping vegetables to catching a ball, require understanding both how objects respond to physical forces and how to use them effectively. These capacities, tool use and physical reasoning, are often assumed to rely on shared cognitive and neural mechanisms. At some level, this correspondence is expected: using an object typically requires understanding its physical properties. However, both capacities are complex and multicomponential, so the relationship between them may vary across levels of representation and task demands. Here, we asked whether third-person physical reasoning about object dynamics can dissociate from tool use (i.e., performing a tool's typical action, such as using a hammer to drive a nail) in individuals with left-hemisphere stroke. We tested 11 patients, five of whom showed impairments in tool use. Physical reasoning was assessed using a novel collection of tasks probing judgments about mass, velocity, and timing across static and dynamic scenes. Tool use was evaluated using a classic gesture-to-sight task, a pantomime-based measure in which participants are shown pictures of familiar tools and asked to demonstrate how each would be used. We identified an individual-level dissociation: patient I.A. showed impairment in gesturing the use of objects despite preserved physical reasoning, often outperforming neurotypical controls. This pattern was complemented by patient N.P., who showed the reverse profile, with intact tool use gestures but difficulties in some physical reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that the ability to reason about the physical world and tool use can dissociate behaviorally and be independently disrupted by brain damage. This challenges the view that physical reasoning and tool use draw on the same underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms and suggests that at least some of their components are distinct.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-\">https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-</a></p> <p>I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't want to pay for a server, and didn't want to host one on my computer. I have a flagship phone; an S25+ with Snapdragon 8 and 12 GB RAM. It's ridiculous. I wanted to run intense computational coding on my phone, and didn't have a solution to keep my phone from overheating. So. I built one. This is non-rooted using sys-reads and Termux (found on F-Droid for sensor access) and Termux API (found on F-Droid), so you can keep your warranty. \ud83d\udd25</p> <p>What my project does: Monitors core temperatures using sys reads and Termux API. It models thermal activity using Newton's Law of Cooling to predict thermal events before they happen and prevent Samsung's aggressive performance throttling at 42\u00b0 C. </p> <p>Target audience: Developers who want to run an intensive server on an S25+ without rooting or melting their phone. </p> <p>Comparison: I haven't seen other predictive thermal modeling used on a phone before. The hardware is concrete and physics can be very good at modeling phone behavior in relation to workload patterns. Samsung itself uses a reactive and throttling system rather than predicting thermal events. Heat is continuous and temperature isn't an isolated event. </p> <p>I didn't want to pay for a server, and I was also interested in the idea of mobile computing. As my workload increased, I noticed my phone would have temperature problems and performance would degrade quickly. I studied physics and realized that the cores in my phone and the hardware components were perfect candidates for modeling with physics. By using a &quot;thermal tank&quot; where you know how much heat is going to be generated by various workloads through machine learning, you can predict thermal events before they happen and defer operations so that the 42\u00b0 C thermal throttle limit is never reached. At this limit, Samsung aggressively throttles performance by about 50%, which can cause performance problems, which can generate more heat, and the spiral can get out of hand quickly. </p> <p>My solution is simple: never reach 42\u00b0 C</p> <p>Physics-Based Thermal Prediction for Mobile Hardware - Validation Results</p> <p>Core claim: Newton's law of cooling works on phones. 0.58\u00b0C MAE over 152k predictions, 0.24\u00b0C for battery.
