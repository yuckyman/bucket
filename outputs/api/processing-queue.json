      "title": "A Diachronic Investigation of the Change in Form and Formational-Semantic Systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language Lexicon",
      "content": "It has been argued in previous research that several competing pressures guide the directions of language evolution (economy vs. redundancy; arbitrariness vs. systematicity). For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",

      "content": "High-density tactile sensor arrays that replicate human touch could restore texture perception in paralyzed individuals. However, conventional tactile sensor arrays face inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, sensitivity, and crosstalk suppression due to microstructure size limitations and signal interference. To address this, we developed a tactile sensor featuring 10 \u03bcm-scale pyramid tips that achieve ultra-high sensitivity (8.082 kPa^(-1) in 0.2-0.5 kPa range). By integrating a...",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",
