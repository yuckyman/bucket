      "title": "Drowsiness alters the neural dynamics but not the core computations of multisensory integration",
      "content": "Fluctuations in alertness shape perception and behaviour, yet how they affect the brain's ability to integrate information across senses remains poorly understood. Here we investigated whether multisensory integration is preserved as humans transition from wakefulness to drowsiness. Participants performed an audio-tactile detection task while electroencephalography tracked spontaneous declines in alertness. Behaviourally, multisensory stimulation continued to facilitate responses during drowsiness, despite slowing and increased omissions. However, reaction-time distributions revealed reduced violations of race-model predictions, indicating weakened computational evidence for multisensory integration. Neurally, event-related signatures of multisensory interactions were delayed and attenuated during drowsiness. By contrast, multivariate decoding showed that multisensory neural representations remained detectable, although less temporally stable. Crucially, early cross-state generalization revealed shared representational structure across alertness states, indicating preserved core multisensory computations. These findings show that multisensory integration remains functional but is dynamically altered as alertness declines, revealing how the brain maintains adaptive behaviour during the wake-to-sleep transition.",

      "title": "A Drosophila screen identifies domino as a link between chromatin regulation and synaptic organization",
      "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with diverse genetic risk factors. To identify conserved mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes, we conducted a targeted screen in Drosophila using MiMIC insertion mutants of high-confidence genes from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database. Behavioral assays identified 52 heterozygous lines with significant changes in sleep, activity, or social behavior in one or both sexes. Among these, the chromatin remodeler domino (dom), the ortholog of human SRCAP, emerged as a particularly compelling candidate. Heterozygous dom mutants exhibited altered social spacing and male-biased sleep and activity dysregulation, phenotypes that were replicated in an additional allele. RNA-sequencing of adult brains showed that reduced dom expression affected genes involved in signaling and structural pathways in both sexes, offering potential molecular links to the behavioral outcomes. In addition, dom disruption caused widespread splicing dysregulation, with differentially spliced genes enriched for pathways related to synaptic signaling, further implicating synaptic communication as a convergent mechanism. Consistent with these results, immunofluorescence revealed increased synaptic architecture in the antennal lobe, a brain region associated with sleep and sensory processing. Together, these findings highlight the utility of Drosophila for modeling conserved ASD risk genes and implicate domino in the regulation of synaptic communication and behavior through transcriptional and splicing regulation.",

      "title": "Repeated Mild Head Injury Establishes a Senescent Cranial Bone Marrow Niche that Impairs Brain Metabolism",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) of any severity is associated with long-term systemic inflammation and increased risk of peripheral comorbidities, yet the mechanisms driving immune dysregulation and accelerated aging after repeated mild head impacts remain poorly defined. Here, we investigated the acute and chronic effects of repeated mild TBI (rmTBI) on distal and proximal bone marrow compartments in the femur and calvaria, respectively. Using a modified weight-drop mouse model delivering rotational and acceleration/deceleration forces (3 hits/week for up to 16 weeks), rmTBI produced no mortality, skull fracture, hemorrhage, or brain leukocyte infiltration. One day after three consecutive impacts, rmTBI induced robust proliferation of LSK stem/progenitor cells in both femoral and calvarial marrow, evidenced by Ki67 expression, BrdU incorporation, and increased monocyte output. By 8 weeks (24 impacts), injury-induced proliferation subsided and LSK cells exhibited increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and upregulation of tumor suppressor genes. At 16 weeks (48 impacts), LSK populations were depleted at both sites, displaying reduced proliferative capacity, telomere shortening, and pancytopenia in otherwise young adult mice. Calvarial bone marrow cells exposed to rmTBI released a distinct cytokine and proteomic secretome marked by elevated IL-6, suppressed mitochondrial and metabolic signaling, and enhanced DNA repair pathways. Notably, skull-derived secretome factors impaired cortical and hippocampal mitochondrial metabolism, and reduced microglial mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these findings identify replicative senescence of the brain-adjacent bone marrow niche as an early and progressive consequence of repeated mild head injury, linking rmTBI to long-lasting metabolic dysfunction, impaired immunity, and accelerated aging.",

      "title": "Restoration of Rapid-Eye Movement Sleep During Cocaine Abstinence Reduces Incubation of Cocaine Seeking and Normalizes Dopamine Transporter Function",
      "content": "Progressive increases in cocaine craving or seeking during abstinence from cocaine are thought to contribute to relapse. Recent observations suggest that sleep disruptions during abstinence from cocaine may have a significant influence on cocaine seeking. While the neural mechanisms underlying the association between sleep disruptions and increases in cocaine seeking during abstinence continue to be investigated, alterations in mesolimbic dopamine transmission may be a common factor. In these studies, we assessed whether sleep disruptions during abstinence are associated with incubation of cocaine seeking and dopamine terminal adaptations in the nucleus accumbens core of female and male rats. We observed that intermittent access to cocaine followed by abstinence reduced rapid-eye movement sleep, intensified cue-induced cocaine seeking, and enhanced dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. Notably, a sleep restoration procedure that restricted sleep to the light phase (active period) restored rapid-eye movement sleep, prevented incubation of cocaine seeking, and normalized baseline dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. These findings indicate that rapid-eye movement sleep disruptions during abstinence contribute to exaggerated cocaine seeking and that dopamine transporter adaptations are a potential molecular substrate through which these changes occur. Thus, interventions that restore sleep during cocaine abstinence may serve as effective behavioral therapies for reducing cocaine craving and preventing subsequent relapse.",

      "title": "Cocaine and caffeine elicit different dopamine receptor-mediated locomotor activity profiles: insights from a new model.",
      "content": "Background: The locomotor activity elicited by cocaine and caffeine can be distinguished via their underlying mechanisms and via differential responses to neuropharmacological manipulations. However, both cocaine- and caffeine-induced locomotor activity can be blocked by non-selective dopamine receptor antagonists, implying that we may not be able to distinguish their locomotor activity at the level of the dopamine receptor-mediated mechanism. With the rationale that this limitation may be due to a lack of sensitivity of current methods, we have developed a new Quantitative Structure of Curve Analytical (QSCAn) model. We hypothesized that QSCAn will be more effective, relative to the current model, in differentiating the dopamine receptor-mediated mechanism of cocaine versus caffeine-induced locomotor activity. Methods: We assessed locomotor activity (quantified as distance traveled in cm over time) due to injections of saline (n = 6), cocaine (10 mg/kg i.p, n = 8) and caffeine (20 mg/kg i.p, n = 6) in male Sprague Dawley rats with and without pretreatment with vehicle and cis-flupenthixol (0.2 mg/kg i.p, non-selective dopamine receptor blocker)(current model). Because distance traveled over time follows an inverted u-shaped time-response curve, we employed gaussian fit of this structure to obtain several behavioral variables (QSCAn model). We compared both models. Results: The current model could not distinguish the locomotor activity profile of cocaine versus caffeine following vehicle and cis-flupenthixol pretreatments. QSCAn model could distinguish cocaine versus caffeine in the presence and absence of non-selective dopamine receptor blockade. Conclusions: The new QSCAn model may be a promising tool to distinguish/characterize different psychostimulant-related effects.",
