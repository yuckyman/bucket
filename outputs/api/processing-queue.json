      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "Cumulative timing-dependent changes in corticospinal excitability during suprathreshold paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation",
      "content": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely used to assess inhibitory and facilitatory circuits within the primary motor cortex. However, accumulating evidence suggests that even brief TMS paradigms may induce unintended changes in corticospinal excitability. Here, we examined whether suprathreshold paired-pulse TMS delivered at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) associated with intracortical facilitation or long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI) elicits cumulative changes in motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. In experiment 1, we reanalysed data from 17 participants who received 20 suprathreshold paired-pulses at eight ISIs (10-200 ms) and 40 unconditioned single pulses. Stimulation was pseudo-randomised and distributed evenly across four blocks. A linear mixed-effects model assessed trial-wise changes in MEP amplitude across ISIs. We replicated the design in an independent sample (n=10, experiment 2). A significant trial-by-ISI interaction was observed in both cohorts. Specifically, MEP amplitudes increased across trials for ISIs of 20 and 30 ms (p<0.05), but remained stable at LICI-related ISIs (100-150 ms). A similar increase was also seen with single-pulse TMS. These findings demonstrate that suprathreshold paired-pulse TMS at short ISIs can cumulatively enhance corticospinal excitability during stimulation. Furthermore, the results suggest potential for using these protocols not just for probing cortical circuits, but also as interventions to modulate motor system excitability.",

      "title": "Age-Dependent Effects of Paraquat-Induced Parkinsonism on Serum Alpha-Synuclein Expression, Substantia Nigra Histoarchitecture and Neurobehaviour in Male Wistar Rats",
      "content": "Background Paraquat (PQ), a widely used herbicide, has been implicated in Parkinsons disease (PD)-like neurodegeneration through oxidative stress and alpha-synuclein (a-syn) dysregulation. Age is a critical determinant of vulnerability to neurotoxins. This study investigated age-dependent effects of paraquat-induced Parkinsonism on serum a-syn expression, substantia nigra histoarchitecture, and neurobehavior in male Wistar rats. Methods Sixty-three male Wistar rats were stratified into juvenile, young-adult, and adult cohorts and assigned to control, paraquat, or PQ+Recovery groups (n = 7). Paraquat (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered twice weekly for three weeks; recovery animals were monitored for two months. Neurobehavioral tests including hanging wire, open field, and Y-maze were conducted at baseline, post-exposure, and post-recovery. Serum and substantia nigra a-syn were quantified using ELISA, and histology assessed cytoarchitectural changes. Data were analyzed using t-tests and ANOVA (p is less than or equal to 0.05). Results Neurobehavioral outcomes showed no significant differences in spontaneous alternation across cohorts. Latency-to-fall remained stable in young-adult and juvenile rats but declined in adult PQ+Recovery animals (p = 0.05). Line crossings decreased in adult paraquat rats (p = 0.02). Urine pools decreased significantly in young-adult paraquat (p = 0.0010) and PQ+Recovery groups (p = 0.0016), with group effects in young-adult (p = 0.007) and juvenile cohorts (p = 0.047). Substantia nigra a-syn showed no significant differences (p > 0.22); serum a-syn differed in young adults (p = 0.039), with reduced levels in the recovery group (p = 0.047). Histology revealed paraquat-induced neuronal degeneration which was most severe in adults, and partial structural restoration after recovery period. Conclusion Paraquat induces mild, age-dependent neurotoxic effects, with adults showing the greatest vulnerability. Differential serum a-syn responses and histological findings highlight developmental stage as a key modulator of susceptibility and recovery following environmental neurotoxin exposure.",

      "title": "Neural and Behavioral Responses to Social Norm Violations Across Trust and Fairness Contexts",
      "content": "Fairness and trust are core components of social decision making, yet little is known about how individual differences shape neural responses across these contexts. Because the Trust Game (TG) and Ultimatum Game (UG) involve different forms of norm violation, betrayal and interpersonal unfairness, they allow us to test whether neural responses generalize across social contexts Using fMRI during both the TG and UG, we examined how trait-level social cognition interacts with brain systems supporting norm evaluation. Participants demonstrated robust sensitivity to fairness in the Ultimatum Game. A whole-brain psychophysiological interaction analysis revealed that connectivity between the posterior temporoparietal junction (pTPJ) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during unfair offers from a human partner was moderated by the interaction between Autism Quotient (AQ) scores and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) response to betrayal in the Trust Game. Individuals with higher AQ showed distinct patterns of pTPJ-dlPFC coupling depending on their neural sensitivity to trust violations. These findings highlight a cross-task mechanism through which trait-level social cognition and trust related conflict signals shape network-level responses to interpersonal unfairness.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",
