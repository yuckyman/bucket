      "title": "Exploring Implicit Perspectives on Autism in Large Language Models Through Multi-Agent Simulations",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.15437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer potential support for autistic people, but this potential requires understanding the implicit perspectives these models might carry, including their biases and assumptions about autism. Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15412v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mental health concerns are rising globally, prompting increased reliance on technology to address the demand-supply gap in mental health services. In particular, mental health chatbots are emerging as a promising solution, but these remain largely untested, raising concerns about safety and potential harms. In this paper, we dive into the literature to identify critical gaps in the design and implementation of mental health chatbots. We contribute an operational checklist to help guide the development and design of more trustworthy, safe, and user-friendly chatbots. The checklist serves as both a developmental framework and an auditing tool to ensure ethical and effective chatbot design. We discuss how this checklist is a step towards supporting more responsible design practices and supporting new standards for sociotechnically sound digital mental health tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15385v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Natural-language-to-visualization (NL2VIS) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved the accessibility of data visualization. However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.\n  We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.\n  We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.\n  The code and evaluation artifacts are available at https://zenodo.org/records/17062309.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15308v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extended Reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, provides immersive and interactive experiences across diverse applications, from VR-based education to AR-based assistance and MR-based training. However, widespread XR adoption remains limited due to two key challenges: 1) the high cost and complexity of authoring 3D content, especially for large-scale environments or complex interactions; and 2) the steep learning curve associated with non-intuitive interaction methods like handheld controllers or scripted gestures. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a promising solution by enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction and automating content generation. Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion-based generation, GenAI can interpret ambiguous instructions, understand physical scenes, and generate or manipulate 3D content, significantly lowering barriers to XR adoption. This paper explores the integration of XR and GenAI through three concrete use cases, showing how they address key obstacles in scalability and natural interaction, and identifying technical challenges that must be resolved to enable broader adoption.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interactive narrative (IN) authors craft spaces of divergent narrative possibilities for players to explore, with the player's input determining which narrative possibilities they actually experience. Generative AI can enable new forms of IN by improvisationally expanding on pre-authored content in response to open-ended player input. However, this extrapolation risks widening the gap between author-envisioned and player-experienced stories, potentially limiting the strength of plot progression and the communication of the author's narrative intent. To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces.",

Informal texts hide dependencies, while formal systems expose every detail in ways that are not always human-readable. Dependency graphs offer a middle ground by making visible the structure of results, definitions, and proofs. We present KnowTeX, a standalone, user-friendly tool that extends the ideas of Lean's Blueprints, enabling the visualization of conceptual dependencies directly from LaTeX sources. Using a simple \"uses\" command, KnowTeX extracts relationships among statements and generates previewable graphs in DOT and TikZ formats. Applied to mathematical texts, such graphs clarify core results, support education and formalization, and provide a resource for aligning informal and formal mathematical representations. We argue that dependency graphs should become a standard feature of mathematical writing, benefiting both human readers and automated systems.",

This study empirically explores how disabled students perceive robot-based support, comparing two interaction roles, one information based (signposting) and one disclosure based (sounding board), and two embodiment types (physical robot/disembodied voice agent). Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy. We also analyse differences between disability types. These results provide critical insights into the potential of social robots to mitigate accessibility barriers in higher education, while highlighting ethical, social and technical challenges.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15292v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diabetes is a significant and continuously rising health challenge in Indonesia. Although many artificial intelligence (AI)-based health applications have been developed for early detection, most function as \"black boxes,\" lacking transparency in their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods offer a solution, yet their technical outputs are often incomprehensible to non-expert users. This research aims to develop a mobile application front-end that presents XAI-driven diabetes risk analysis in an intuitive, understandable format. Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met. The combination of visualization and textual narrative effectively enhanced user understanding (average score 4.31/5) and empowered preventive action, supported by a 100% technical testing success rate.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15291v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Independent navigation is a core aspect of maintaining social participation and individual health for vulnerable populations. While historic cities such as Edinburgh, as the capital of Scotland, often feature well-established public transport systems, urban accessibility challenges remain and are exacerbated by a complex landscape, especially for groups with multiple vulnerabilities such as the blind elderly. With limited research examining how real-time data feeds and developments in artificial intelligence can enhance navigation aids, we address this gap through a mixed-methods approach. Our work combines statistical and machine learning techniques, with a focus on spatial analysis to investigate network coverage, service patterns, and density through live Transport for Edinburgh data, with a qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with the mentioned target group. The results demonstrate the highly centralised nature of the city's transport system, the significance of memory-based navigation, and the lack of travel information in usable formats. We also find that participants already use navigation technology to varying degrees and express a willingness to adopt artificial intelligence. Our analysis highlights the importance of dynamic tools in terms of sensory and cognitive needs to meaningfully improve independent travel.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15290v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Testing conversational AI systems at scale across diverse domains necessitates realistic and diverse user interactions capturing a wide array of behavioral patterns. We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains.",

      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

      "content": "Microscale biophysical alterations in neuronal dynamics can have profound implications for macroscale pathological outcomes in the brain. Despite the critical need to link neuronal perturbations to large-scale disease manifestations, few studies successfully bridge these hierarchical scales. Here, we bridge microscale biophysical variability within neuronal dynamics to macroscale disease-related phenotypes. We find that Drosophila models expressing tauopathy- and epilepsy-associated molecular mutations exhibit increased dynamic instability in the timing of action potential initiation. We show that the microscale biophysical origin of this instability is enhanced variability in voltage-gated sodium channel currents during non-stationary channel inactivation. We also find that treatment with antiepileptic drugs stabilizes neuronal dynamics by modulating this variability in voltage-gated sodium channel currents. Finally, we show that neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy exhibit analogous dynamic instability, which is reversible by administration of antiepileptic medications. Our results highlight how subtle microscale neuronal instabilities propagate and are amplified to produce macroscopic pathological phenotypes, providing new biophysical insights into neurological disorders and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention.",

The present study sought to understand how informant-rated everyday cognitive abilities related to memory, language, spatial skills, planning, organization, and divided attention\u2014as measured by the Everyday Cognition (ECog) scale\u2014change over time in a diverse sample of older adults. Method: Participants (<em>N</em> = 891) from the University of California Davis Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center longitudinal cohort (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 76.1, <em>SD</em><sub>age</sub> = 7.4) were followed for an average of 4.4 years with annual ECog assessments. Multilevel beta regression was used to model ECog scores as a function of time, cognitive domain, diagnosis change, and\u2014in a neuroimaging subsample (<em>N</em> = 264)\u2014cross-sectional and longitudinal total gray matter and hippocampus volume. Results: ECog domains changed at different rates when modeled as a function of diagnosis change; differences in domain were most apparent in the stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-MCI and MCI-to-dementia conversion groups. By contrast, ECog domains changed at the same rate when modeled as a function of baseline gray matter volume and longitudinal gray matter volume change, corresponding to other research suggesting that cognitive domains change at relatively uniform rates over time. In separate models, total gray matter and hippocampus atrophy were salient predictors of ECog score changes. At baseline, hippocampus volume was the strongest predictor of ECog intercepts. Conclusions: Although some caution is warranted interpreting score changes due to floor and ceiling effects, the ECog appears sensitive to underlying gray matter atrophy and change in clinical disease severity when used longitudinally.

They recognize the many serious challenges that today\u2019s scientists are facing in public perception, funding, and policy. Building upon the journal\u2019s strong, 39-year foundation of scientific excellence and outstanding leadership, they aspire to leverage the journal\u2019s rigorous editorial processes, tremendous resources, and international reach for the betterment of society, scientists, and the communities of people with conditions that affect the central nervous system. In this editorial, they provide a brief history of Neuropsychology to help us plot a course for the next 5 years. From their vantage point, Neuropsychology\u2019s future is data-driven, transparent, inclusive, and community-oriented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved)",
