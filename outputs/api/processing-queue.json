      "title": "P75NTR blockading inhibits Trem2+ M1 phenotype microglia activation and myelin damage following mild traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "The pathological basis underlying mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced long-term cognitive impairment is not fully understood. It is supposed that mTBI induces residential microglia activation rather than peripheral leukocyte infiltration to promote neuroinflammation, thus triggering myelin damage as well as cognitive impairment. The transformation of microglia towards a pro-inflammatory (M1 type) or anti-inflammatory (M2 type) state is critical for restraining the cerebral inflammatory response to acute or chronic insults. In addition to classical M1- and M2-like phenotypes, a specific subgroup of microglia, which is referred to as disease-associated microglia (DAM), the transition of which is regulated by triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2), is also demonstrated to play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases sharing similar pathological procedures to mTBI. The expression and function of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in microglia vary depending on the type and severity of the specific pathological stimuli. In the current study, we investigated whether peripheral leukocytes infiltrated the brain following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) using a CX3CR1- and CCR2-double transgenic reporter mouse model. We also examined whether M1- or M2-like microglia exhibited a disease-associated microglia (DAM) phenotype after mTBI, as indicated by their Trem2 expression. Then we explored the expression of p75NTR in M1- and M2-like phenotype microglia after mTBI and its modulating effects on the activation of Trem2 positive M1- and M2-like phenotype microglia, neuroinflammatory reaction, myelin damage, and cognitive performance. We found that most of the activated residential microglia after mTBI were Trem2 positive and p75NTR expression was significantly elevated in Trem2-positive M1-type microglia post-mTBI, correlating with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine release, demyelination, and cognitive deficits. Pharmacological blockade of p75NTR using the antagonist TAT-Pep5 suppressed M1 microglial activation, reduced neuroinflammation, and restored myelin integrity, leading to marked improvements in cognitive function. Mechanistically, p75NTR exhibited a cell-type-specific regulatory role in neuroinflammatory responses, potentially through interacting with Trem2 to modulate DAM-like microglia activation. These findings highlight p75NTR as a key mediator of mTBI-induced neuropathology and propose its inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate secondary neuroinflammation and cognitive decline.",

      "content": "IntroductionBuratti-Harel syndrome (BURHAS) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by SIAH1 (Siah1 E3 ubiquitin ligase) variants, characterized by infantile hypotonia, global developmental delay, and variable multisystem involvement. To date, 13 pathogenic SIAH1 variants have been reported in 13 patients, but the functional and phenotypic implications of mutations in the SIAH1 zinc finger domain remain poorly characterized. This study included a Chinese pediatric patient with unexplained neurodevelopmental and multisystem abnormalities.MethodsTrio whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed to identify potential causative variants. Structural modeling was used to analyze the impact of the identified variant on SIAH1 protein structure. Additionally, a comparative genotype-phenotype analysis was conducted on 14 genetically confirmed BURHAS cases (including the present patient).ResultsA de novo missense variant [c.288C > G (p.Phe96Leu)] in the zinc finger domain of SIAH1 was identified in the patient. Structural modeling revealed that this variant destabilized the zinc finger domain (DDG = \u20132.09 kcal/mol), which may disrupt the ZnF-1 domain function by impairing zinc ion-mediated structural stability. Comparative analysis of 14 genetically confirmed cases (including this study) demonstrated a genotype-phenotype correlation: zinc finger domain variants (n = 4) exhibited broader phenotypic heterogeneity compared to RING domain variants (n = 7), which were enriched for severe developmental delay and reproductive anomalies.DiscussionThis study expands the mutational spectrum of SIAH1-associated disorders. We advocate for the inclusion of SIAH1 in diagnostic panels for patients with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders and multisystem dysmorphisms.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",
