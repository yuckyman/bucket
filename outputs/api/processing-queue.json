      "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

      "title": "Automated 3D segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from micro-computed tomography images using anatomy-aware neural networks",
      "content": "Objective. Precise segmentation and quantification of nerve morphology from imaging data are critical for designing effective and selective peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) therapies. However, prior studies on nerve morphology segmentation suffer from important limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. This study introduces a deep learning approach for robust and automated three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of human vagus nerve fascicles and epineurium from high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) images. Methods. We developed a multi-class 3D U-Net to segment fascicles and epineurium that incorporates a novel anatomy-aware loss function to ensure that predictions respect nerve topology. We trained and tested the network using subject-level five-fold cross-validation with 100 microCT volumes (11.4 \u03bcm isotropic resolution) from cervical and thoracic vagus nerves stained with phosphotungstic acid from five subjects. We benchmarked the 3D U-Net\u2019s performance against a two-dimensional (2D) U-Net using both standard and anatomy-specific segmentation metrics. Results. Our 3D U-Net generated high-quality segmentations (average Dice similarity coefficient: 0.93). Compared to a 2D U-Net, our 3D U-Net yielded significantly better volumetric overlap, boundary delineation, and fascicle instance detection. The 3D approach reduced anatomical errors (topological and morphological implausibility) by 2.5-fold, provided more consistent inter-slice boundaries, and improved detection of fascicle splits/merges by nearly 6-fold. Significance. Our automated 3D segmentation pipeline provides anatomically accurate 3D maps of peripheral neural morphology from microCT data. The automation allows for high throughput, and the substantial improvement in segmentation quality and anatomical fidelity enhances the reliability of morphological analysis, vagal pathway mapping, and the implementation of realistic computational models. These advancements provide a foundation for understanding the functional organization of the vagus and other peripheral nerves and optimizing PNS therapies.",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "title": "A study on the dreams of Miao and Han college students in Guizhou Province.",
      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "CTSSP: A temporal\u2013spectral-spatial joint optimization algorithm for motor imagery EEG decoding",
      "content": "Objective. Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interfaces hold significant promise for neurorehabilitation, yet their performance is often compromised by electroencephalography (EEG) non-stationarity, low signal-to-noise ratios, and severe cross-session variability. Current decoding methods typically suffer from fragmented optimization, treating temporal, spectral, and spatial features in isolation. Approach. We propose common temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns (CTSSP), a unified framework that jointly optimizes filters across all three domains. The algorithm integrates: (1) multi-scale temporal segmentation to capture dynamic neural evolution, (2) channel-adaptive finite impulse response filters to enhance task-relevant rhythms, and (3) low-rank regularization to improve generalization. Main results. Evaluated across five public datasets, CTSSP achieves state-of-the-art performance. It yielded mean accuracies of 76.9% (within-subject), 68.8% (cross-session), and 69.8% (cross-subject). In within-subject and cross-session scenarios, CTSSP significantly outperformed competing baselines by margins of 2.6%\u201314.6% (p < 0.001) and 2.3%\u201313.8% (p < 0.05), respectively. In cross-subject tasks, it achieved the highest average accuracy, proving competitive against deep learning models. Neurophysiological visualization confirms that the learned filters align closely with motor cortex activation mechanisms. Significance. CTSSP effectively overcomes the limitations of decoupled feature extraction by extracting robust, interpretable, and coupled temporal\u2013spectral-spatial patterns. It offers a powerful, data-efficient solution for decoding MI EEG in noisy, non-stationary environments. The code is available at https://github.com/PLC-TJU/CTSSP.",

      "content": "Upon hearing objects collide, humans can estimate physical attributes such as material and mass. Although the physics of sound generation is well established, the inverse problem that listeners solve - of inferring physical parameters from sound - remains poorly understood. Classical accounts posit the use of acoustic cues that correlate with physical variables, but do not explain how humans might distinguish multiple concurrent physical causes. To study this problem, we built a probabilistic generative model of impact sounds, combining theoretical acoustics with statistics of object resonances measured from hundreds of everyday objects, and used it to synthesize and manipulate experimental stimuli. Humans accurately judged object properties from collision sounds. However, when both of the colliding objects varied, performance was impaired if the distribution of object resonances deviated from those measured in real-world objects. The results suggest that listeners use internal physical models to separate the acoustic contributions of objects in the world.",

      "title": "A Key Regulator of Dendritic Morphology in Supragranular Neocortex Impacts Mismatch Negativity",
      "content": "Background: Cytoskeletal structure and neuronal function are heavily intertwined, and altered pyramidal neuron morphology (e.g., reduced dendritic arbors) has been consistently identified in the neocortex of individuals with psychiatric disorders. A missense mutation in Kalrn (Kalrn-PT) enhances activation of RhoA, a cytoskeletal regulator, and leads to adolescent-onset dendritic regression in supragranular auditory cortex. To investigate the relationship between this spatiotemporally altered cytoskeletal structure and psychiatric-relevant dysfunction, we examine the functional impacts of this genetic mutation, focusing on mismatch negativity -- a common biomarker of altered sensory integration that matures across adolescence. Methods: In Kalrn-PT and littermate wild-type mice, pyramidal dendritic morphology was assessed across primary visual cortex (V1) layers using Golgi staining (n=172 neurons/26 mice). Local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking were recorded during a visual oddball sequence (n=25 mice). Deviance detection -- the rodent neural analogue of mismatch negativity -- was analyzed across V1 layers. Results: Kalrn-PT mice exhibit reductions in V1 dendritic length specific to layer 2/3, mirroring observations in post-mortem samples from people with psychiatric disorders. Deviance detection was reduced in LFPs from Kalrn-PT mice and absent in layer 2/3 neurons, despite typical feature selectivity and firing rates. These deficits were accompanied by reduced functional connectivity between visual and frontal areas. Conclusions: These results highlight alterations in higher-level sensory cortical integration in Kalrn-PT mice and demonstrate that adolescent-onset, disease-relevant structural and functional phenotypes can be linked by a common upstream effector. Further, these alterations appear restricted to supragranular layers, demonstrating an outsized role for Kalrn, particularly longer isoforms, in superficial neocortex.",

      "title": "Subthreshold Kir and Ih currents modulate excitability of Layer 1 VIP interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Cortical layer 1 (L1) is a key site for integrating top-down and bottom-up information and is populated by inhibitory interneurons, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells. These interneurons regulate information flow across the cortical column by disinhibiting pyramidal neurons, yet the subthreshold ionic mechanisms that shape their excitability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the electrophysiological properties of L1b VIP interneurons in mouse mPFC, focusing on the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) and inward-rectifying potassium current (Kir). Using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we find that L1b VIP interneurons exhibit constitutively active Ih and Kir conductances. Inhibition of Ih with ZD-7288 hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP), increased input resistance (Rin), and prolonged action potential (AP) duration without altering rheobase or firing frequency, while increasing EPSP-spike coupling probability. Blocking Kir with BaCl2 depolarized the RMP, increased Rin and membrane time constant, reduced rheobase, increased firing frequency, and similarly enhanced EPSP-spike probability and AP duration. Voltage-clamp experiments confirmed the presence of ZD-7288-sensitive Ih and BaCl2-sensitive Kir currents of small amplitude but operating on a high-resistance membrane, consistent with a strong impact on excitability. In contrast, neither Ih nor Kir inhibition affected the amplitude or frequency of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs, indicating that these currents do not measurably alter basal excitatory synaptic transmission. Immunofluorescence revealed weak somatic HCN1 and no detectable HCN2 expression in L1b VIP interneurons. Notably, Kir inhibition unmasked an Ih-dependent voltage sag during hyperpolarizing steps, suggesting that constitutive Kir activity normally masks Ih recruitment at subthreshold potentials. Together, these results indicate that Ih and Kir are active near RMP in L1b VIP interneurons and jointly regulate their passive properties, intrinsic excitability, and EPSP-spike coupling, therefore shaping how L1 VIP cells filter incoming signals and influence information flow within the prefrontal cortical column.",

      "content": "In vectorial embeddings of word meaning, semantic features often reflect consistent directions, or axes, within a representational space. A classic example is gender: the vector spanning boy to girl can be added to the embedding for king to predict queen. Here we show that the same principle governs semantically driven neural responses in the human brain. We recorded single-neuron activity in three brain regions while participants listened to podcasts. Across fifteen analogical categories, including gender, number, and antonymy, we observed consistent vectorial directions, resulting in parallelogram structure within the neural manifold. Among pronouns, vectors corresponding to grammatical case, number, person, and possession obeyed the principle of commutativity, resulting in a prismatic structure, demonstrating that semantic axes can be factorized. We found parallelogram structure in all three regions, with some regional specialization: noun pluralization was more robust in the hippocampus than in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or orbitofrontal cortex, whereas verbal conjugation effects were more robust in the ACC. Finally, we found evidence for partial functional specialization at the neuron level: neurons most strongly involved in one analogy type were less involved in others. These principles parallel representational structure observed in large language models. Together, these findings support a geometric basis for analogical reasoning.",

Precise mechanisms of injury, especially in the more subtle presentation of postnatal infection, are not fully elucidated. Here, we defined the effects of ZIKV on the developing brain using single cell transcriptomics, histopathology and design-based stereology, diffusion MRI, and neurobehavioral assessments in infant rhesus macaques. ZIKV upregulated interferon-stimulated genes in activated microglia and cell death pathways in neurons and downregulated metabolism and differentiation genes in mature oligodendrocytes. Abnormal micro-organization of the corpus collosum and limbic white matter tracts was seen on diffusion weighted imaging. A curated gene set associated with autism spectrum disorder risk was negatively enriched in inhibitory and excitatory neurons from ZIKV-infected infants, with increased emotional reactivity already evident two weeks following infection. From single cells to organism-level behaviors, these results define the pathways and processes disrupted by early-life ZIKV infection.",
