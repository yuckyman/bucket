      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",
