      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "content": "Are actions organized like sentences? Recent evidence showed reciprocal transfer between tool use and syntactic comprehension, reflecting shared basal ganglia (BG) resources for action and language. The proposed mechanism is that embedding a tool into the motor plan increases the hierarchical structure of actions paralleling the organization of sentences. If so, overlap with linguistic computations should emerge specifically during the initiation and/or reach-to-grasp phase, when tool embedding dynamically updates the relation with the target, rather than when the object is stably held in the tool grip. Forty French native speakers underwent fMRI while performing a sentence comprehension (object vs. subject relatives), and a motor task (with pliers vs. hand). Only the reach-to-grasp phase with the tool elicited neural patterns resembling those of object-relatives, within overlapping BG regions. This phase-specific convergence identifies the BG as a hub for domain-general hierarchical computations, unifying syntactic embedding for language and tool use.",

      "content": "Neural theories of how the prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports working memory rely on evidence from decades of pioneering macaque research. In some respects, efforts to translate these animal models of working memory in human PFC using neuroimaging have largely failed. One possible explanation, before concluding key non-homologies between the species, is that previous neuroimaging studies used resolutions too coarse to be sensitive to intermixed distributions of neurons tuned to memorized features. To resolve this concern, we scanned human PFC at 900 micron resolution using 7T fMRI. We found that population activity in retinotopically-organized superior precentral sulcus, rather than the predicted midlateral PFC, persists during memory, encodes fine-grained information about memorized items, predicts behavioral errors in memory, and forms a stable subspace with a topological organization yoked to visual space. These results have important implications for both functional homologies between the species and theories of how the PFC supports working memory.",

      "title": "Gradual proactive regulation of body state by reinforcement learning of homeostasis",
      "content": "Living systems maintain physiological variables such as temperature, blood pressure, and glucose within narrow ranges; a process known as homeostasis. Homeostasis involves not only reactive feedback but also anticipatory adjustments shaped by experience. Prior homeostatic reinforcement learning (HRL) models have provided a computational account of anticipatory regulation under homeostatic challenges. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for gradual, trial-by-trial adjustment and for extinction learning. To address this issue, we developed a continuous HRL framework that enables trial-wise tuning of anticipatory regulation. The model incorporates biologically informed components: asymmetric reinforcement, weighting negative outcomes more than positive outcomes; and a dual-unit, context-gated inhibitory mechanism. We applied the framework to thermoregulatory conditioning with ethanol-induced hypothermia and successfully reproduced cue-triggered compensation, gradual tolerance, and rapid reacquisition after extinction. We then extended the framework to multiple physiological variables influenced by shared neural or hormonal control signals, and found that when regulatory priorities across variables were uneven, a deviation in one variable propagated through shared control to others, yielding a cascading, system-wide failure to return to ideal state (non-recovery); a pattern reminiscent of autonomic dysregulation (e.g., dysautonomia, ME/CFS). Overall, our framework provides a computational basis to advances a systems-level understanding of multi-organ homeostatic dysregulation in vivo.",

      "title": "Specific and converging modulation of the CRH and noradrenergic systems across drug classes and natural rewards in an incubation of seeking paradigm",
      "content": "Stress is known to play a critical role in relapse to drug use as well as in food craving. Craving itself is a key determinant of relapse, and cue-induced drug craving has been shown to increase, or incubate, over time for certain drugs such as cocaine and nicotine, though this effect is less consistent for others such as opiates. However, the contribution of stress-related biochemical systems to the incubation of seeking has not yet been systematically examined in animal models, nor has the specificity of these mechanisms been tested across different drug classes or reinforcers. To address this gap, we trained rats to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg, i.v.), heroin (0.075 mg/kg, i.v.), or saline, and subsequently assessed changes in plasma corticosterone, ornithine and other stress-related amines, alongside central gene and protein expression (CRH, CRH2 receptor, and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor subunits) after 1 or 30 days of withdrawal. A parallel experiment was conducted using sucrose as a reinforcer. Our findings indicate that although most effects were substance-specific, convergent adaptations were also observed, particularly within noradrenergic systems, suggesting that these mechanisms may represent a common substrate of incubation and a potential target for pharmacological interventions in relapse.",

      "title": "Attentional disengagement during external and internal distractions reduces neural speech tracking in background noise",
      "content": "Within-situation disengagement - the mental withdrawal during conversations in acoustically challenging environments - is a common experience of older people with hearing difficulties. Yet, most research on the neural mechanisms of attentional disengagement from speech listening has focused on the distraction by one competing speaker, whereas within-situation disengagement is often characterized by distraction towards external visual stimuli or internal thoughts and occurs in situations with ambient, multi-talker background masking. Across three electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, the current study examined how disengagement due to external and internal distractions affect the neural tracking of speech masked by different levels of multi-talker babble (speech in quiet, +6 dB, and -3 dB SNR). We observed early (<200 ms), enhanced neural responses to the speech envelope for speech masked by background babble compared to speech in quiet (Experiments 1-3), suggesting stochastic facilitation. Importantly, neural tracking of the speech envelope was reduced when individuals were distracted by a visual-stimulus stream (Experiment 2) and by internal thought and imagination (Experiment 3). There were some indices suggesting the greatest disengagement-related decline in neural speech tracking occurs for the most difficult speech-masking condition, but this was not consistent across all measures. The current data show that disengagement due to external and internal distractions yield decreases in neural speech tracking, potentially suggesting a common neural pathway through which gain is downregulated in auditory cortex. These results indicate that disengagement from listening can be identified through non-invasive neural measures.",

      "title": "Cortical Iron in Schizophrenia: A Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Diffusion Tensor Imaging MRI Study",
      "content": "Background and Hypothesis Cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia remain poorly treated. Iron dysregulation has been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction and schizophrenia. While elevated postmortem iron in Brodmann areas 10-11 has been linked to schizophrenia, this has not been assessed in vivo. We therefore used iron-sensitive MRI to test whether cortical iron is elevated in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Study Design We acquired quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI to measure magnetic susceptibility ({chi}), a marker of iron, in 158 participants aged 18-45 (73 with schizophrenia and 76 matched healthy controls). As {chi} is reduced by myelin, we conducted diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess mean diffusivity, an iron-insensitive marker also reduced by myelin. Study Results Primary analyses showed no significant case-control differences in {chi} in the whole cortex (p=0.675) or Brodmann areas 10-11 (p=0.537). Exploratory analyses examined {chi} for 362 cortical regions and a voxelwise analysis, correcting for multiple comparisons. Two left temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) junction regions showed significantly elevated {chi} in schizophrenia: the posterior TPO junction (d=0.752, p<0.001) and the superior temporal visual area (d=0.638, p=0.033), which remained significant after adjusting for mean diffusivity and clinical covariates (p=0.001 and p=0.023, respectively). Voxelwise analysis confirmed elevated {chi} in schizophrenia in the left TPO junction (peak t=5.62). Conclusions This study provides the first in vivo evidence of elevated cortical iron in schizophrenia, suggesting regional iron accumulation may contribute to cortical pathology.",

      "title": "DLK inhibition has sex-specific effects on neuroprotection and locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes devastating functional deficits, in part due to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity that drive death of lesion-adjacent viable neurons. One signaling protein that promotes neuronal apoptosis and activates stress-responsive genes is dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), which is a neuron-enriched kinase that responds to extracellular stress by activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. We hypothesized that SCI would robustly activate DLK signaling and that acute pharmacological inhibition of DLK would suppress JNK pathway activation, thereby enhancing neuroprotection and locomotor recovery in our mouse model of moderate contusion SCI. Using western blotting, we observed that SCI induced strong and sustained activation of the JNK pathway in the injured spinal cord starting at 4 hours post-injury through 7 days. Complementary analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq revealed that DLK expression is highly enriched in neurons across all injury phases. Following SCI, neurons exhibited robust, time-dependent upregulation of multiple DLK-responsive transcripts, consistent with sustained pathway activation during the acute and subacute periods. Systemic treatment with the selective DLK inhibitor IACS'825 effectively suppressed intraspinal JUN activation in a dose-dependent manner. However, unexpectedly, DLK inhibition delayed functional recovery in male mice and expanded lesion volume by 71%, with no significant effect in females. These findings highlight the complex roles of DLK signaling after SCI, revealing a need to understand the sex-specific molecular mechanisms that modulate injury outcomes. Future studies should further optimize timing, location, and cellular targeting of DLK therapeutic strategies to improve neuroprotection and neurologic recovery after SCI.",

      "title": "Innovative 3D-image analysis of cerebellar vascularization highlights angiogenic gene dysregulations in a murine model of apnea of prematurity",
      "content": "Apnea of prematurity (AOP) affects 50% of preterm infants causing intermittent hypoxia (IH), which can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. Cerebellar abnormalities have been observed in AOP but the relationship between vascular alterations and neural development remains unclear. This study investigates how IH affects cerebellar angiogenesis using a murine model of AOP. We developed an innovative 3D imaging workflow combining IMARIS and VesselVio software to quantitatively analyze cerebellar vascularization at different postnatal stages (P4, P8, P12, P21, and P70). We correlate these results with a transcriptomic analysis of 23 angiogenesis-related genes in the same stages to uncover the associated molecular pathways. We found that IH induced significant vascular changes, particularly at P4, with a global increase in vascular-network dimensions. By P8, the vascular network normalized, but genes were downregulated in all pathways studied. After P12, at the end of the IH protocol, transcriptional regulations vary but persist long-term. Moreover, differential analysis showed distinct effects on superficial versus deep vascular networks, allowing for a more precise understanding of remodeling patterns throughout development. Overall, transcriptomic changes were associated with morphological alterations in a time-dependent manner, suggesting a multiphasic IH response through development with lasting effects. Key regulations included VEGF, angiopoietin, and matrix metalloprotease signaling. These findings demonstrate that IH disrupts cerebellar angiogenesis in parallel with neurogenesis, potentially contributing to the neurodevelopmental deficits observed in AOP. Thus, the interconnected nature of angio- and neurogenesis during cerebellar development makes it crucial to take vascular aspects into account in therapeutic approaches to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output.

      "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

      "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
      "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",
