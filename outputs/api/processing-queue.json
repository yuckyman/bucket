      "title": "Unveiling early visual cortical mechanisms in perceptual filling-in: a parametric study of eccentricity and movement dependence",
      "content": "Surface perception relies on interactions between boundary encoding and surface filling-in. In a perceptual filling-in paradigm, a blank figure becomes perceptually replaced by a textured background after prolonged fixation of a point away from the figure. Filling-in begins when neurons representing the figure's boundary adapt, allowing background-related activity to spread into the figure's retinotopic representation. Adaptation proceeds faster the better the boundary is stabilized in a neuron's receptive field (RF). We hypothesized that moving the figure boundary beyond a neuron's RF would reduce adaptation and hinder filling-in, with larger movements permitting progressively less filling-in. As RF size increases with eccentricity, we further hypothesized that greater eccentricities would require larger movements to interfere with filling-in. Our results confirmed both predictions. The reduction in filling-in duration with increasing motion range permitted estimating RF size at each eccentricity. The slope of a linear function relating RF size to eccentricity matched values reported in human fMRI studies of V1/V2, suggesting that boundary adaptation involves early visual areas. We also explored whether microsaccade amplitude affects filling-in, but found no supporting evidence. Thus, external figure motion and microsaccades may disrupt adaptation through different mechanisms. These findings provide new insights into neural adaptation processes preceding perceptual filling-in.",

      "content": "The phenomenon of cross-excitation - interaction between neurons of a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in intact organism, presents a great challenge since its discovery. It can not be addressed to classical neuron-neuron interactions, as the mentioned neurons are believed to be physiologically isolated by glial sheaths from one another. In this work we test existing hypotheses which explain the phenomenon from both biophysical and statistical perspectives. Our conclusion is that neither each proposed mechanism alone, nor interactions of them can adequately describe cross-excitation in normal conditions. We wish to draw greater attention towards the phenomenon, as it seems to be an important part of normal sensory information processing.",

      "content": "Obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, are major global health challenges. Early hypothalamic microinflammation is emerging as a key contributor to the onset of metabolic dysfunction, but its temporal dynamics, underlying mechanisms, and sex-specific differences remain unclear. Here, we examined the effects of short-term high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on hypothalamic microinflammation, glial activation, and insulin signaling in male and female mice. Males rapidly developed hypothalamic microinflammation, characterized by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive gliosis, and impaired insulin signaling, whereas females did not show these alterations. Interestingly, we also observed a sex-specific pattern in microglial M2 polarization: females maintained a sustained M2 response throughout the experimental period, while males exhibited only a transient peak that declined in the following days. These sex-specific differences in microglial dynamics and polarization may be linked to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, a classical mediator of inflammatory signaling. To further explore this, we analyzed mice lacking JNK3, the CNS-enriched isoform of JNK. Loss of JNK3 disrupted early microglial polarization, abolished the transient M2 response, and predisposed males to enhanced gliosis and partial hypothalamic insulin resistance, while females retained partial resilience. These findings indicate that JNK3 contributes to the regulation of microglial dynamics and polarization in response to metabolic stress. Overall, our study highlights a sex-dependent role of microglia and JNK in shaping early hypothalamic microinflammation and central insulin sensitivity, providing potential targets for intervention in obesity-associated metabolic disease.",

      "title": "Autonomic Indicators of Self-Transcendence: Insights from the Numadelic VR Paradigm",
      "content": "Self-transcendent experiences (STEs) offer profound and beneficial shifts in perspective, yet remain largely inaccessible outside elite contemplative or pharmacological contexts. Neural measures have deepened our understanding of these states, but their cost and limited ecological validity constrain broader application. This study evaluates heart rate variability (HRV) amplitude, a measure reflecting dynamic sympathovagal balance, as a cost-effective and sustainable physiological marker of STE during numadelic virtual reality (VR) experiences, multi-person, immersive journeys that can induce STE through dissolving self-boundaries and fostering embodied presence. Building on previous work linking non-ordinary states of consciousness with autonomic nervous system activity during psychedelic drug administration, we tested the hypothesis that HRV amplitude may reflect STE depth and predict affective and prosocial outcomes during non-drug numadelic VR experiences. Specifically, ninety-six participants engaged in guided meditation within either a numadelic VR setting or a non-VR audio-guided group format. Physiological data (cardiac activity and respiration) were recorded during the meditation, alongside psychological assessments pre- and post-session. Findings confirm that HRV amplitude measured during numadelic VR correlates with subjective STE ratings, compassion traits, and emotional improvement following VR practice. Additional analysis of data from a prior psychedelic drug study further validated the relevance of this measure across consciousness expanding modalities. These results advance the psychophysiological mapping of STEs and highlight HRV amplitude as a potential real-time biomarker which may help to guide participants toward self-transcendent states within adaptive environments. By integrating contemplative science with immersive design, this work supports the development of scalable tools that enhance both access to and understanding of STEs.",

      "title": "The School Cafeteria Problem: Disrupted Visuospatial Attention During Multisensory Speech-in-Noise Perception in Children with ADHD",
      "content": "BACKGROUND Many children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have difficulty distinguishing speech in crowded scenarios with competing conversations and noise. This can impact learning and community participation. Prior work has implicated audiovisual integration of lip movements with speech sounds as a potential underlying mechanism, but difficulty in accurately deploying spatial attention is an important, often overlooked, factor that may impact the accuracy of speech perception in noisy environments. OBJECTIVE Evaluate patterns of audiovisual integration and allocation of visuospatial attention during speech processing in a multiple-talker scenario among school-age children with ADHD and typically developing children (TD). METHODS We recruited 7-12-year-old children with ADHD to participate in an integrated virtual reality and electrophysiologic (EEG) speech-in-noise perception paradigm. In virtual reality, children were asked to press a button whenever a centrally-located target character spoke a target monosyllabic word, while ignoring any words spoken by two flanking distractor characters. We manipulated 1) audiovisual (AV) content by intermixing trials containing either audio, visual, or multisensory AV representations of the three characters and 2) spatial attention demands by including trials with and without interference from the distracting speakers. We measured AV gain in target detection accuracy. Simultaneously, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were continuously recorded via a 128-channel electrode array as an index of visuospatial attention allocation to each speaker. To elicit SSVEP, the target and distractor speakers were tagged with different visual frequency oscillations (23hz and 15hz, respectively). EEG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the corresponding first and second harmonics for those frequency bands was measured over the occipital scalp. RESULTS Children with ADHD showed reduced AV gain relative to TD controls. TD controls also demonstrated more robust SSVEP at 23Hz and 46Hz (target speaker) than at 15Hz (distractor speakers). Compared to TD children, children with ADHD had reduced selective activation in response to the target. As a result, children with ADHD showed more equivalent allocation of visuospatial attention between 23Hz target and 15Hz distractor frequencies. CONCLUSIONS Children with ADHD demonstrate a reduction in the typical perceptual benefit afforded by exposure to multisensory compared to unisensory speech stimuli, accompanied by substantial differences in the allocation of visuospatial attention to the relevant speaker. Thus, dysregulation of selective visuospatial attention may impair their ability to effectively perceive language in noisy settings.",

      "title": "Response dynamics in macaque ventral stream recapitulate the visual hierarchy",
      "content": "Chronic recording in macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT) revealed a progression of feature selectivity over the duration of the response, with different images evoking strongest responses in different time bins. Neurons responded briskly and transiently to early best images and gave slower and more sustained responses to later best images. Correlations between IT selectivity and deep neural network (DNN) activations in early layers were faster and more transient than correlations with deeper DNN layers, suggesting a hierarchical representation unfolding. Analysis of best images in different time bins showed that early best images were simpler, or made up of fewer parts, than later best images. This simple-to-complex selectivity dynamic is consistent with, but more universal than, previously reported dynamics of global-to-local or category-to-exemplar selectivity. In parallel with the simple-to-complex selectivity progression, the image selectivity and the population activity became sparser during the response, consistent with the hypothesis of a canonical cortical microcircuit that pools inputs and incorporates neighboring-neuron inhibition. We propose that this temporal cascade in IT recapitulates the multiple antecedent stages in the visual hierarchy, which also show a simple-to-complex progression of feature selectivity.",

      "content": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is linked to schizophrenia, but prevailing models centered on reduced number and activity of inhibitory interneurons and the resulting excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance do not explain selective cognitive impairments. Here, we show that repeated adolescent NMDAR antagonism produces short-term memory (STM) deficits by weakening thalamofrontal (TF) synaptic transmission. In mice repeatedly exposed to ketamine, STM impairment coincided with reduced release probability and vesicle refilling at mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) synapses, without detectable changes in layer 2/3 to layer 2/3 synaptic release probability, intrinsic excitability, or synaptic ultrastructure. These presynaptic deficits were accompanied by diminished direction-selective population coding in the dmPFC as revealed by decoding analysis and impaired delayed alternation performance in the Y-maze. Chemogenetic strengthening of MD to dmPFC projections restored both neural selectivity and behavior. Our findings identify a circuit-specific presynaptic mechanism linking adolescent NMDAR hypofunction to cognitive dysfunction, challenging interneuron-centric models and establishing TF synapses as a potential therapeutic target in NMDAR-related disorders.",

      "content": "Successes and failures shape affective experience and self-esteem. Self-compassion has been proposed as a protective factor, allowing individuals to acknowledge both strengths and shortcomings without excessive self-criticism. However, the mechanisms through which self-compassion influences changes in affect and self-esteem remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally tested whether self-compassion modulates the links between performance feedback, affective experience, and self-esteem. Participants completed an effortful performance task and received trial-by-trial feedback while repeatedly rating their positive affect. Results show that self-compassion buffered against declines in self-esteem among poorly performing individuals, predicted higher overall positive affect throughout the task, and was associated with increased post-task self-esteem. Moreover, performance feedback predicted positive affect, which in turn predicted post-task self-esteem, although these pathways were not moderated by self-compassion. Together, these findings add to the growing evidence for how self-compassion impacts positive affect and self-esteem and may inform treatment strategies for clinical populations characterized by low self-esteem or heightened self-criticism.",

      "title": "Autonomic reflex plasticity associates with time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in a murine model with hyperactive stress circuits",
      "content": "Sudden unexpected death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with Epilepsy. Although SUDEP results from cardiorespiratory arrest, its underlaying mechanisms are poorly understood. Considering the significant association between stress-related disorders and Epilepsy, we hypothesized that stress exaggerates autonomic reflexes critical in cardiorespiratory function and that these exaggerated reflexes increase susceptibility to SUDEP. Experiments were performed using a novel mouse model of SUDEP where chronic hyperactivity of central corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons (Kcc2/Crh) predisposes mice to SUDEP in the weeks following seizure induction based on the ventral intrahippocampal kainate (vIHKA) model of chronic Epilepsy. In our study, the vIHKA model was employed in both wild-type (WT) and Kcc2/Crh mice while they were monitored with EEG and ECG using in vivo telemetry and underwent terminal autonomic reflex testing at time points when mortality peaked and plateaued. A resting tachycardia developed by one week following vIHKA injection but subsided by day 30 in both WT and Kcc2/Crh mice. During spontaneous seizures, Kcc2/Crh mice had more pronounced reflex-like ictal bradycardias compared to WT controls that notably occurred just prior to seizure termination. vIHKA injection promoted time-dependent exaggeration of autonomic reflexes, with Kcc2/Crh mice exhibiting robust autonomic disturbances compared to WT controls, including a pronounced serotonin-mediated Bezold Jarisch reflex. Taken together, our findings indicate that increased autonomic disturbance burden parallels time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in mice with hyperactive stress circuits.",

      "title": "Graded regulation of microtubule-binding of Tau by the phosphorylation state of the proline-rich region in living neurons",
      "content": "Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal morphology and axonal transport. While phosphorylation is known to regulate Tau-microtubule interactions, the contribution of specific phosphorylation patterns in situ remains poorly understood due to the complexity of the intracellular environment. In this study, we combined fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons with dephosphorylation-mimetic mutations and computational modeling to analyze the effects of phosphorylation on Tau-microtubule interaction. We particularly focused on the proline-rich region, of which phosphorylation has been studied in physiological and pathological perspectives, and generated a dephosphorylation-mimetic Tau mutant by substituting key phosphorylation sites with alanine residues and compared its microtubule-binding dynamics to those of WT-Tau in FRAP experiments. Experimental data, together with simulation-based parameter exploration, revealed that the overall number of phosphorylated sites plays a more dominant role than their specific locations in modulating Tau-microtubule affinity. These findings provide new insights into the post-translational regulation of Tau and establish a computational-experimental framework for interrogating intracellular protein dynamics.",

      "title": "Excessive activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway triggers adult-onset motor axonal degeneration",
      "content": "Axonal and synaptic degeneration are key hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we performed an unbiased forward genetic mosaic screen to identify genes required for maintenance of adult motor axons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the Drosophila leg. We identified 49 mutations in 30 genes, including mutations in 8 genes resulting in adult-onset progressive degeneration. We found that loss of pebbled (peb) function results in adult-onset motor axonal and NMJ degeneration, and age-dependent motor deficits. Peb is the Drosophila RREB1 ortholog, a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that negatively regulates transcription of RAS/MAPK pathway target genes. Loss of peb function resulted in excessive RAS/MAPK pathway activation, and loss of function of other negative regulators of the RAS/MAPK pathway also induced adult-onset progressive NMJ degeneration and motor deficits. Importantly, treatment of adult flies with the MEK1/2 inhibitor mirdametinib induced a dosage-dependent rescue of peb mutant motor neurodegenerative phenotypes. Thus, RAS/MAPK pathway overactivation results in adult-onset progressive neurodegeneration, which can be prevented by RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition.",

      "title": "GluTrooper: a novel reporter mouse line for whole-brain imaging of glutamate dynamics",
      "content": "Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. However, tools to image glutamate dynamics in the whole brain with high spatial and temporal resolution are lacking. Therefore, we developed GluTrooper, a novel mouse line engineered for inducible and long-lasting expression of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR3. GluTrooper mice crossed with Emx1-Cre lines demonstrated uniform and stable sensor expression in excitatory neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. iGluSnFR3 expression remained stable for at least 12 months, enabling longitudinal observations of glutamate dynamics over extended periods. Using multimodal imaging in awake mice, we demonstrated the versatility of GluTrooper across multiple spatial scales: from mesoscale widefield cortical imaging to cellular resolution with two-photon microscopy. Moreover, during cortical spreading depolarization, bilateral whole-brain glutamate dynamics and contralateral cortical disinhibition were detected with high fidelity. Accordingly, the GluTrooper may open new avenues for the better understanding of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the mammalian brain.",
