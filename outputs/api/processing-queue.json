      "title": "Fus depleted oligodendrocytes reduce neuronal damage and attenuate AD progression in the AppNL-G-F mouse",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes (OL) and myelin abnormalities have emerged as important contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease (AD). OL maintain neuronal health through myelin axon interactions and by supplying neurotrophic and metabolic support. To gain insight on how OL and myelin may improve neuronal deficits associated with AD, we have generated a novel mouse model (AD/cKO) by crossing the AppNL-G-F mouse which carries three human AD mutations in the mouse App gene with the FusOLcKO which has thicker myelin associated with greater cholesterol biosynthesis. The spatial working memory deficits manifested by the aged AD mouse were fully rescued by the FusOLcKO. This outcome was associated with reduced neuronal oxidative damage, preserved presynaptic structures at the plaque niches and a shift in microglia state at the niches in both hippocampus and cortex. In contrast, plaque burden and microglia density were decreased in the hippocampus but not in cortex, uncoupling the neuronal and microglia effects from the amyloid burden. Single cell transcriptomics of AD/cKO hippocampal OL revealed upregulation of energy metabolism and antioxidant genes, suggesting a role of OL enhanced energy metabolism in protecting neurons and affecting microglia state in AD pathology.",

      "title": "A mouse model of classical trigeminal neuralgia via intradural compression of the trigeminal nerve",
      "content": "Introduction: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a debilitating orofacial pain condition that adversely affects quality of life. Although heterogeneous, the most common form of TN is classical TN, characterized by paroxysmal bouts of pain in response to otherwise innocuous stimuli. It is believed that classical TN results from neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. However, the underlying pathophysiology of TN is not well understood, thus limiting the development of targeted therapies. Current animal models lack translational relevance, particularly in their inability to replicate intradural nerve root compression, a core anatomic component of TN. Methods: We developed a TN mouse model that achieves intradural nerve root compression via a retro-orbital approach confirmed by anatomic dissection and magnetic resonance imaging. To assess behavioral outcomes, we measured orofacial pain through facial wiping and interaction with a reward stimulus. Pharmacological responsiveness was tested using carbamazepine administration. Mechanistic studies included calcium imaging of trigeminal ganglia (TG), electrophysiologic recordings to measure resting membrane potential and rheobase, and immunohistochemical analysis of the TG. Results: The model elicited orofacial neuropathic pain, substantiated by increased facial wiping and reduced interaction with a reward stimulus, behaviors that suggest both spontaneous and evoked pain. Carbamazepine attenuated these behaviors, suggesting pharmacologic relevance to current TN treatment. Calcium imaging showed heightened spontaneous activity in the TG, and electrophysiologic recordings revealed an increased resting membrane potential and a reduced rheobase. Finally, immunohistochemical studies showed infiltration of CD45+ cells, demyelination and an increase in CGRP expression in the TG, supporting the presence of neuroinflammation after nerve root compression.",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Parabrachial nucleus (PBN) neurons expressing Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) modulate fear- and anxiety-like behavior. It is unknown if PBN(CGRP) neurons play a role in anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol or after repeated stress. First, to investigate the anxiogenic role of activating PBN(CGRP) neurons in naive conditions, CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM3D(Gq) DREADDs in the PBN were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM). PBN(CGRP) neurons drive phasic activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that synchronizes to anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, a transsynaptic anterograde AAV-based strategy was used in C57BL/6J female and male mice to activate BNST neurons innervated by the PBN projections (BNSTPBN) during EPM. Additionally, PBN(CGRP) neurons and CGRP-innervated BNST cells were measured in experimentally-naive CGRP-DTRGFP female and male mice, to investigate baseline sex-differences. Next, to investigate the impact of PBN(CGRP) inhibition on anxiety-like behavior following chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE), CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM4D(Gi) DREADDs in the PBN were tested in EPM during acute withdrawal. Additionally, mice were exposed to repeated forced swim stress (FSS) paired with PBN(CGRP) inhibition followed by testing in the novelty suppressed feeding task (NSFT), to investigate the role of PBN(CGRP) on anxiety-like behavior after stress in prolonged withdrawal. Activating PBN(CGRP) or BNSTPBN neurons did not change behavior in EPM in either sex. Total PBN(CGRP) and CGRP-innervated BNST cells did not differ between females and males. In acute withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons decreased time in the open arm and increased time in the closed arm selectively in females. In prolonged withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons during FSS did not affect immobility in either sex, but did subsequently decrease approach frequency and average speed selectively in males. Altogether, the data report the anxiogenic effect of manipulating PBN(CGRP) neurons is stress and sex-specific during alcohol withdrawal.",

      "title": "Contralesional activity reflects compensation, while brainstem detour pathways support skilled motor recovery after stroke",
      "content": "Large strokes frequently result in lasting motor deficits and trigger extensive reorganization within the brain and spinal cord. Altered neuronal activity in the contralesional hemisphere has been documented in both humans and rodent models, yet its role in functional recovery versus maladaptation remains unresolved. Here, we used chronic wide-field calcium imaging to monitor bilateral cortical activity in mice performing a skilled reach-to-grasp task before and days to weeks after stroke. Strokes produced persistent fine motor impairments, which were only partly alleviated by intensive rehabilitative training. While cortical activity was in particular suppressed in the ipsilesional cortex after stroke, training promoted sustained increases in contralesional sensorimotor activity. However, ridge regression analysis of neural and behavioral data indicated that this activity largely reflected compensatory use of the intact paw rather than recovery of the impaired forelimb. Axonal tracing nevertheless revealed enhanced projections from contralesional motor cortex to ipsilesional brainstem nuclei - including the midbrain and pontine reticular nucleus - specifically in trained animals. These findings identify a rehabilitation-induced corticofugal pathway supporting motor recovery, highlighting a target for neuromodulation strategies in chronic post-stroke impairment.",

      "title": "Intrabody-guided synapse proteomics defines pyramidal neuron input architecture and uncovers early remodeling in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Across their proximal and distal dendritic domains, pyramidal neurons (PNs) integrate inputs that differ in morphology and function. Hippocampal CA1 PNs are among the earliest affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular composition of their inputs and selective vulnerability remain poorly defined. We develop an intrabody-guided proximity-labeling strategy that targets the biotin ligase TurboID to endogenous postsynaptic scaffolds for cell-autonomous mapping of postsynaptic proteomes. Targeting PSD95 or Homer1 enables selective labeling of excitatory postsynaptic proteins in mouse CA1 PNs and resolves subsynaptic organization by comparing the two probes. Mapping the proteomes of major CA1 inputs uncovers a proximal-distal molecular logic that underlies their distinct properties. Applying this approach in the AppNL-G-F AD mouse model reveals an early signaling-driven phase of synaptic remodeling followed by a later translation-linked phase, with persistent downregulation of glutamatergic components. These results provide a molecular atlas of CA1 PN inputs and identify stage-specific mechanisms of synaptic vulnerability in early AD.",

      "title": "Accurate evaluation of neural sensitivity to weak alternating electric fields requires protocols accounting for input dependence",
      "content": "Background: Weak alternating electric fields (~1 V/m) modulate nervous system activity. Yet, the exact mechanism by which such low amplitude electric fields can modulate neural activity is still unknown despite the use of specific protocols aiming at quantifying neural sensitivity. Objective: To characterize how the measurement protocol can impact neural sensitivity to weak electric fields and bias in vivo sensitivity. Methods: We considered a variety of somatic clamp stimulation to drive the activity of biophysical morpho-realistic reconstructed neurons during extracellular alternating stimulation to quantify the sensitivity to the field depending on the nature of cells' activity. Results: Cells sensitivity to alternating current stimulation depended on the type of input used to drive their activity, with a different frequency response for each protocol, with a trend for inhibitory neurons to be more sensitive to higher stimulation frequencies. Even with the same clamp protocol, sensitivity depended on the statistics of the input used. Significance: Neuronal sensitivity to alternating current stimulation is highly input-dependent, which has been largely neglected so far, and depends on the current statistic of the received inputs, and is not reliably represented by simple current clamps protocols.",

      "title": "Absence of Local Retinotopy in the Mouse Optic Tract",
      "content": "Retinotopy is a fundamental organizational principle of the visual system, where neighboring neurons represent adjacent points in visual space. This spatial relationship is established by precise anatomical wiring across successive areas, from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the visual cortex. To examine the precision of this topographic arrangement within the long-range projection axons themselves, we recorded retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the mouse optic tract (OT) and mapped their receptive fields (RFs). As expected for a retinotopically organized area, we found that nearby LGN cell pairs had significantly smaller RF distances than distant pairs. In contrast, no such relationship was observed among RGC axons in the OT. Modelling analyses further confirmed that the observed RF distances in the OT were incompatible with any locally retinotopic arrangement. Instead, the OT retained only coarse topography, with ~20 degrees RF deviations or ~45 m axonal displacements from an ideal retinotopic organization. These results demonstrate that the mouse OT lacks fine-scale retinotopy and maintains only broad topographic structure.",
