      "content": "The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates visual information with task demands to guide saccadic eye movements. Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.",

      "title": "Advancing High-Resolution 7T Diffusion MRI: Evaluating Phase-Encoding Correction Strategies for Distortion Correction from Basic to Four-Way Acquisitions",
      "content": "Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling. Data statement: Data will be made available in BIDS format in openneuro sharing platform upon acceptance of the manuscript. To be updated with DOI.",

      "title": "Anterior thalamic nucleus inputs to the retrosplenial cortex are unperturbed in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive function. Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.",

      "title": "Molecular dynamics of the pathogenic KCNQ2 variant G256W reveal mechanisms of channel dysfunction in epileptic encephalopathy",
      "content": "Brain voltage-gated potassium channels containing the subunit KCNQ2 are essential for regulating electrical signals contributing to sensation, learning, memory, and motor control. De novo KCNQ2 variants are among the more common Mendelian causes of early life epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. Some patients with KCNQ2 variants are affected with KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2 DEE) characterized by seizures and developmental delays. Children with KCNQ2 DEE exhibit a range of impairment patterns that appear to be correlated with specific consequences of the variant for protein function. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics to analyze a pathogenic missense variant KCNQ2 G256W, located in the pore turret. G256W subunit simulations showed migration of the hydrophobic W256 sidechain towards the lipid membrane. This movement affected turret structure and mobility prominently involving K255. We identified novel hydrogen bonding interactions in the wild type KCNQ2 turret region which formed a network that extended to the selectivity filter and identified N258, H260P, and K283 as key residues. Simulations comparing WT and G256W tetrameric channels exhibited more conformationally unstable ion selectivity filters for G256W. We analyzed how different stoichiometries of wild type and G256W subunits, as expected in heterozygous individuals, impacted dynamics and compared the G256W results to three additional variants of the turret-selectivity filter network. Our results provide additional support for an integral role of the KCNQ2 turret selectivity filter stability. The majority of severe KCNQ2 DEE variants are clustered near the selectivity filter in the pore domain. Our study provides insights that may be broadly applicable to this clinically important allele subgroup.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all! I just released a <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/\">new HTML5 parser</a> that I'm really proud of. Happy to get any feedback on how to improve it from the python community on Reddit.</p> <p>I think the trickiest thing is if there is a &quot;market&quot; for a python only parser. Parsers are generally performance sensitive, and python just isn't the faster language. This library does parse the wikipedia startpage in 0.1s, so I think it's &quot;fast enough&quot;, but still unsure.</p> <p>Anyways, I got HEAVY help from AI to write it. I directed it all carefully (which I hope shows), but GitHub Copilot wrote all the code. Still took months of work off-hours to get it working. Wrote down a short blog post about that if it's interesting to anyone: <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/\">https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/</a></p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>It takes a string of html, and parses it into a nested node structure. To make sure you are seeing exactly what a browser would be seeing, it follows the html5 parsing rules. These are VERY complicated, and have evolved over the years.</p> <pre><code>from justhtml import JustHTML html = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div id='main'&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; doc = JustHTML(html) # 1. Traverse the tree # The tree is made of SimpleDomNode objects. # Each node has .name, .attrs, .children, and .parent root = doc.root # #document html_node = root.children[0] # html body = html_node.children[1] # body (children[0] is head) div = body.children[0] # div print(f&quot;Tag: {div.name}&quot;) print(f&quot;Attributes: {div.attrs}&quot;) # 2. Query with CSS selectors # Find elements using familiar CSS selector syntax paragraphs = doc.query(&quot;p&quot;) # All &lt;p&gt; elements main_div = doc.query(&quot;#main&quot;)[0] # Element with id=&quot;main&quot; bold = doc.query(&quot;div &gt; p b&quot;) # &lt;b&gt; inside &lt;p&gt; inside &lt;div&gt; # 3. Pretty-print HTML # You can serialize any node back to HTML print(div.to_html()) # Output: # &lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt; # &lt;p&gt; # Hello, # &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt; # ! # &lt;/p&gt; # &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> (e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc.)</p> <p>This is meant for production use. It's fast. It has 100% test coverage. I have fuzzed it against 3 million seriously broken html strings. Happy to improve it further based on your feedback.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> (A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives.)</p> <p>I've added a comparison table here: <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/?tab=readme-ov-file#comparison-to-other-parsers\">https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/?tab=readme-ov-file#comparison-to-other-parsers</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Huvet\"> /u/Huvet </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdgpmk/justhtml_a_pure_python_html5_parser_that_just/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdgpmk/justhtml_a_pure_python_html5_parser_that_just/\">[comments]</a></span>",
