      "content": "Visual behavior requires coordinated activity across hierarchically organized brain circuits. Understanding this complexity demands datasets that are both large-scale (sampling many areas) and dense (recording many neurons in each area). Here we present a database of spiking activity across the mouse visual system--including thalamus, cortex, and midbrain--while mice perform an image change detection task. Using Neuropixels probes, we record from >75,000 high-quality units in 54 mice, mapping area-, cortical layer-, and cell type-specific coding of sensory and motor information. Modulation by task-engagement increased across the thalamocortical hierarchy but was strongest in the midbrain. Novel images modulated cortical (but not thalamic) responses through delayed recurrent activity. Population decoding and optogenetics identified a critical decision window for change detection and revealed that mice use an adaptation-based rather than image-comparison strategy. This comprehensive resource provides a valuable substrate for understanding sensorimotor computations in neural networks.",

      "title": "A simple, open-source restraint system for magnetic resonance imaging in awake rats",
      "content": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical tool for translational neuroscience, offering cross-species insights into brain structure and function; however, its application in preclinical research is constrained by routine anesthesia use or sedation, which alters neural activity and limits comparisons to awake human imaging. Awake rodent functional MRI (fMRI) provides a powerful platform for investigating brain function under physiologically relevant conditions, but implementation is limited by technical challenges, particularly head motion and stress during scanning. Most restraint systems employ initial anesthesia, compromising translatability of findings, and highlighting the need for improved designs. We developed a novel restraint system optimized for awake rat fMRI. The system consists of modular 3D-printed components and can be assembled in under five minutes. It is accompanied by a protocol that includes head-post implantation followed by an 11-day habituation period post-surgical recovery. The system eliminates the need for isoflurane anesthesia, ear bars, and bite bars, reducing stress and improving animal comfort. It supports integration with behavioral paradigms such as pupil tracking and licking responses. High-resolution T2-weighted anatomical images and functional scans obtained using the system showed excellent spatial clarity and minimal motion artifacts. Quality control metrics, including head motion parameters and temporal signal-to-noise ratio, confirmed the system's stability and suitability for awake imaging. Functional connectivity analysis revealed robust positive correlations between functionally relevant regions. This system offers a scalable, reproducible, and animal-friendly solution for awake rat fMRI. While the current design limits direct cranial access for multimodal recordings, it enables high-quality, behaviorally enriched imaging without anesthesia.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "content": "Objective. Spike sorting, which involves detecting and attributing spikes to their putative neurons from extracellular recordings, is a common process in electrophysiology and brain\u2013computer interface systems. Recent advances in large-scale neural recording technologies are challenging the conventional algorithms because of the intensive computational workloads required and the accuracy degradation suffered from time-variant spike patterns and significant levels of noise. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated promising performance in processing these large-scale neural recordings. However, their applications are constrained by the labor-intensive data labeling and the lack of fully vectorized frameworks with end-to-end NNs. Approach. We propose E-Sort, an end-to-end NN-based spike sorter with transfer learning and parallelizable post-processing to address both obstacles. Main results. We examined our framework in both synthetic and real datasets. The results of the processing of the synthetic datasets show that our approach can reduce the number of annotated spikes required for training by 44% compared to training from scratch, achieving up to 25.7% higher accuracy. We evaluated E-Sort on various probe geometries, noise levels, and drift patterns, which demonstrates that our design can achieve an accuracy that is comparable with Kilosort4 while sorting 50\u2009s of data in only 1.32\u2009s. To test with real datasets, we first sorted the spikes using Kilosort4 and used the sorted spikes at the initial period to pre-train the NN; then we compared and measured the agreement between the results from the trained model and those from Kilosort4. On average the pre-training process improved the result agreement by 30% approximately. Significance. E-Sort offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate NN-based framework for large-scale spike sorting, significantly reducing manual labeling effort and processing time.",
