      "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease is related to imbalanced stopping-related cortical activity",
      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.14267v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Screen readers are audio-based software that Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people use to interact with computing devices, such as tablets and smartphones. Although this technology has significantly improved the accessibility of touchscreen devices, the sequential nature of audio limits the bandwidth of information users can receive and process. We introduce TapNav, an adaptive spatiotactile screen reader prototype developed to interact with touchscreen interfaces spatially. TapNav's screen reader provides adaptive auditory feedback that, in combination with a tactile overlay, conveys spatial information and location of interface elements on-screen. We evaluated TapNav with 12 BLV users who interacted with TapNav to explore a data visualization and interact with a bank transactions application. Our qualitative findings show that touch points and spatially constrained navigation helped users anticipate outcomes for faster exploration, and offload cognitive load to touch. We provide design guidelines for creating tactile overlays for adaptive spatiotactile screen readers and discuss their generalizability beyond our exploratory data analysis and everyday application navigation scenarios.",

      "title": "VisAider: AI-Assisted Context-Aware Visualization Support for Data Presentations",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.14247v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective real-time data presentation is essential in small-group interactive contexts, where discussions evolve dynamically and presenters must adapt visualizations to shifting audience interests. However, most existing interactive visualization systems rely on fixed mappings between user actions and visualization commands, limiting their ability to support richer operations such as changing visualization types, adjusting data transformations, or incorporating additional datasets on the fly during live presentations. This work-in-progress paper presents VisAider, an AI-assisted interactive data presentation prototype that continuously analyzes the live presentation context, including the available dataset, active visualization, ongoing conversation, and audience profile, to generate ranked suggestions for relevant visualization aids. Grounded in a formative study with experienced data analysts, we identified key challenges in adapting visual content in real time and distilled design considerations to guide system development. A prototype implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in simulated scenarios, and preliminary testing highlights challenges in inferring appropriate data transformations, resolving ambiguous visualization tasks, and achieving low-latency responsiveness. Ongoing work focuses on addressing these limitations, integrating the system into presentation environments, and preparing a summative user study to evaluate usability and communicative impact.",

      "title": "Understanding Data Usage when Making High-Stakes Frontline Decisions in Homelessness Services",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.14141v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Frontline staff of emergency shelters face challenges such as vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, and burnout. The technology they use is often not designed for their unique needs, and can feel burdensome on top of their already cognitively and emotionally taxing work. While existing literature focuses on data-driven technologies that automate or streamline frontline decision-making about vulnerable individuals, we discuss scenarios in which staff may resist such automation. We then suggest how data-driven technologies can better align with their human-centred decision-making processes. This paper presents findings from a qualitative fieldwork study conducted from 2022 to 2024 at a large emergency shelter in Canada. The goal of this fieldwork was to co-design, develop, and deploy an interactive data-navigation interface that supports frontline staff when making collaborative, high-stakes decisions about individuals experiencing homelessness. By reflecting on this fieldwork, we contribute insight into the role that administrative shelter data play during decision-making, and unpack staff members' apparent reluctance to outsource decisions about vulnerable individuals to data systems. Our findings suggest a data-outsourcing continuum, which we discuss in terms of how designers may create technologies to support compassionate, data-driven decision-making in nonprofit domains.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.13814v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Both humans and machine learning models learn from experience, particularly in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for quantitatively studying human cognition.",
