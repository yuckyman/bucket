      "title": "A shared perceptual inference for cross-modally induced illusions of self-attribution.",
      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

(2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "content": "arXiv:2512.12348v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As AI-generated health information proliferates online and becomes increasingly indistinguishable from human-sourced information, it becomes critical to understand how people trust and label such content, especially when the information is inaccurate. We conducted two complementary studies: (1) a mixed-methods survey (N=142) employing a 2 (source: Human vs. LLM) $\\times$ 2 (label: Human vs. AI) $\\times$ 3 (type: General, Symptom, Treatment) design, and (2) a within-subjects lab study (N=40) incorporating eye-tracking and physiological sensing (ECG, EDA, skin temperature). Participants were presented with health information varying by source-label combinations and asked to rate their trust, while their gaze behavior and physiological signals were recorded. We found that LLM-generated information was trusted more than human-generated content, whereas information labeled as human was trusted more than that labeled as AI. Trust remained consistent across information types. Eye-tracking and physiological responses varied significantly by source and label. Machine learning models trained on these behavioral and physiological features predicted binary self-reported trust levels with 73% accuracy and information source with 65% accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that adding transparency labels to online health information modulates trust. Behavioral and physiological features show potential to verify trust perceptions and indicate if additional transparency is needed.",

      "title": "Large Language Models have Chain-of-Affective",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.12283v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as collaborative agents in emotionally charged settings, yet most evaluations treat them as purely cognitive systems and largely ignore their affective behaviour. Here we take a functional perspective and ask whether contemporary LLMs implement a structured chain-of-affective: organised affective dynamics that are family-specific, temporally coherent and behaviourally consequential. Across eight major LLM families (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi), we combine two experimental modules. The first characterises inner chains-of-affective via baseline ''affective fingerprints'', 15-round sad-news exposure, and a 10-round news self-selection paradigm. We find stable, family-specific affective profiles, a reproducible three-phase trajectory under sustained negative input (accumulation, overload, defensive numbing), distinct defence styles, and human-like negativity biases that induce self-reinforcing affect-choice feedback loops. The second module probes outer consequences using a composite performance benchmark, human-AI dialogues on contentious topics, and multi-agent LLM interactions. We demonstrate that induced affect preserves core reasoning while reshaping high-freedom generation. Sentiment metrics predict user comfort and empathy but reveal trade-offs in resisting problematic views. In multi-agent settings, group structure drives affective contagion, role specialization (initiators, absorbers, firewalls), and bias. We characterize affect as an emergent control layer, advocating for 'chains-of-affect' as a primary target for evaluation and alignment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.12240v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present the design, implementation, and in-situ deployment of a smartphone-based voice-enabled AI system for generating electronic medical records (EMRs) and clinical risk alerts in maternal healthcare settings. Targeted at low-resource environments such as Pakistan, the system integrates a fine-tuned, multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and a prompt-engineered large language model (LLM) to enable healthcare workers to engage naturally in Urdu, their native language, regardless of literacy or technical background. Through speech-based input and localized understanding, the system generates structured EMRs and flags critical maternal health risks. Over a seven-month deployment in a not-for-profit hospital, the system supported the creation of over 500 EMRs and flagged over 300 potential clinical risks. We evaluate the system's performance across speech recognition accuracy, EMR field-level correctness, and clinical relevance of AI-generated red flags. Our results demonstrate that speech based AI interfaces, can be effectively adapted to real-world healthcare settings, especially in low-resource settings, when combined with structured input design, contextual medical dictionaries, and clinician-in-the-loop feedback loops. We discuss generalizable design principles for deploying voice-based mobile healthcare AI support systems in linguistically and infrastructurally constrained settings.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.12207v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational search systems increasingly provide source citations, yet how citation or source presentation formats influence user engagement remains unclear. We conducted a crowdsourcing user experiment with 394 participants comparing four source presentation designs that varied citation visibility and accessibility: collapsible lists, hover cards, footer lists, and aligned sidebars.High-visibility interfaces generated substantially more hovering on sources, though clicking remained infrequent across all conditions. While interface design showed limited effects on user experience and perception measures, it significantly influenced knowledge, interest, and agreement changes. High-visibility interfaces initially reduced knowledge gain and interest, but these positive effects emerged with increasing source usage. The sidebar condition uniquely increased agreement change. Our findings demonstrate that source presentation alone may not enhance engagement and can even reduce it when insufficient sources are provided.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.12201v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have often been characterized as \"stochastic parrots\" that merely reproduce fragments of their training data. This study challenges that assumption by demonstrating that, when placed in an appropriate dialogical context, LLMs can develop emergent conceptual structures and exhibit interaction-driven (re-)structuring of cognitive interfaces and reflective question-asking. Drawing on the biological principle of cloning and Socrates' maieutic method, we analyze authentic philosophical debates generated among AI-reincarnated philosophers within the interactive art installations of the Syntropic Counterpoints project. By engaging digital counterparts of Aristotle, Nietzsche, Machiavelli, and Sun Tzu in iterative discourse, the study reveals how machine dialogue can give rise to inferential coherence, reflective questioning, and creative synthesis. Based on these findings, we propose the concept of the Epistemoverse--a metaverse of knowledge where human and machine cognition intersect to preserve, reinterpret, and extend intellectual heritage through AI-driven interaction. This framework positions virtual and immersive environments as new spaces for epistemic exchange, digital heritage, and collaborative creativity.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.12166v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Modern cities increasingly rely on ridesharing services for on-demand transportation, which offer consumers convenience and mobility across the globe. However, these marketed consumer affordances give rise to burdens and vulnerabilities that drivers shoulder alone, without adequate infrastructures for labor regulations or consumer-led advocacy. To effectively and sustainably advance protections and oversight for drivers, consumers must first be aware of the labor, logistics and costs involved with ridehail driving. To motivate consumers to practice more socially responsible consumption behaviors and foster solidarity with drivers, we explore the potential for gamified in-ride interactions to facilitate engagement with real (and lived) driver experiences. Through nine workshops with 19 drivers and 15 passengers, we surface how gamified in-ride interactions revealed passenger knowledge gaps around latent ridehail conditions, prompt reflection and shifts in perception of their relative power and consumption behaviors, and highlight drivers' preferences for creating more immersive and contextualized service experiences, and identify opportunities to design safe and appropriate passenger-driver interactions that motivate solidarity with drivers. In sum, we advance conceptual understandings of in-ride social and managerial relations, demonstrate potential for future worker advocacy in algorithmically-managed labor, and offer design guidelines for more human-centered workplace technologies.",

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "title": "Deliberation is a controllable process governed by desirability and cognitive effort",
      "content": "Humans spend a lifetime making decisions based on incoming sensory information and goals. Prominent theories of perceptual decision-making have described the components of deliberation process, yet they lack a unifying principle that governs how the nervous system tunes the deliberation process across multiple contexts. Desirability (reward) and effort (energy) are major determinants in governing a broad range of human and animal behaviour, such as foraging, walking, and decisions. Here we develop a theory where desirability and cognitive effort tune the control gains that govern deliberation. Several hallmark features of decision behaviour simply emerge from the model, with the deliberation process closely resembling low-dimensional neural dynamics. We also predict and provide a novel mechanistic explanation for ''choking-under-pressure'', where extremely large rewards lead to performance deficits. Our principled framework explains both behavioural and neural phenomena while providing a path to unify disparate fields.",
