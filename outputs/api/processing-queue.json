      "content": "Prolonged esports play can induce cognitive fatigue by placing sustained demands on executive control, decision-making, and stress regulation. Since the brain relies primarily on glucose as an immediate energy source, we hypothesized that a carbohydrate gel designed to prolong post-ingestion glycaemia stabilizes interstitial glucose, attenuates hunger and cognitive fatigue, and helps preserve performance during extended esports play. Eleven healthy young men completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study with two sessions in which they ingested one of two carbohydrate gels matched for total energy and total carbohydrate but differing in carbohydrate composition (high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]-dominant vs maltodextrin [MDX]-dominant) before gameplay. Interstitial glucose was monitored continuously, while hunger, salivary cortisol, pupil diameter, executive function, and in-game performance were assessed repeatedly. Compared with the control (HFCS-dominant) condition, the glycaemia-prolonging formulation maintained higher interstitial glucose levels during the later phase of gameplay, blunted the progressive increase in hunger, and attenuated cortisol responses. These physiological and subjective advantages were accompanied by better executive control and more adaptive defensive behaviors in-game, including fewer fouls and more interceptions. In contrast, pupil diameter, an index of global arousal, remained unchanged across conditions, suggesting that benefits were not driven by altered arousal but by improved glycaemic stability and appetite regulation. These findings indicate that a carbohydrate formulation that prolongs glycaemia can reduce hunger-linked cognitive fatigue and support task-relevant behavior during prolonged esports play. This low-burden nutritional strategy may help sustain mental performance during prolonged digital activities that impose high cognitive demands.",

      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop responsive neurostimulators, such as the NeuroPace responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system, continuously monitor brain activity and deliver electrical stimulation in response to abnormal electrographic activity in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Practical technical constraints limit the temporal resolution of these devices, reducing the quality of EEG recordings. Approach. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to convert high-resolution intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) obtained from inpatient monitoring into the same format, parameters, and resolution produced by the RNS system, allowing direct comparison of iEEG with RNS system data. We validated this technique using data from patients who had both iEEG and RNS. Electrodes from the iEEG and RNS system were co-registered onto the same 3D coordinate grid, and vector math was applied to determine the iEEG electrodes closest to the operational RNS electrodes. Main results. Through spectral analysis, we derived a transfer function that accounts for all filtering and data processing produced by the RNS system. Comparison of the recorded data using visual and spectral analysis from iEEG and RNS confirmed that EEG characteristics were correctly transformed by the filtering function, allowing analysis of how iEEG signals would appear within the RNS system. We demonstrate two examples from the extreme edges of the spectra, showing how DC shifts and high frequency oscillations would be transformed by the RNS. We provide a tutorial to tune this method to local device parameters, a process that can be applied to other devices as well. Significance. This tool allows researchers and clinicians to extract EEG biomarkers from high-resolution iEEG and determine if/how they can be detected in lower-resolution RNS. This provides an opportunity to develop patient-specific seizure detection parameters and investigate the long-term effects of neurostimulation therapy.",

      "title": "Modular presynaptic assemblages scale to postsynaptic partner number",
      "content": "Behavioral diversification can arise through, and is constrained by, evolutionary and inter-individual differences in neural circuit development. Moreover, alteration of focal neural parameters changes the environment in which cells connect into circuits. In the mushroom body, an associative learning center of arthropods, the number of principal Kenyon cells varies widely across species and among individuals. How such variation is developmentally accommodated by projection neurons, which provide sensory input to Kenyon cells, is not understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, we previously demonstrated that projection neurons scale their presynaptic bouton number to Kenyon cell population size. Here, we identify the developmental mechanisms underlying this input flexibility. Boutons arise from projection neuron axonal collaterals; we find that a projection neuron's collateral number is subtype-specific and serves as the substrate through which bouton number scales to Kenyon cell population size. Independent of projection neuron identity or Kenyon cell number, individual collaterals most often produce just one bouton, suggesting collaterals are modular cell biological bouton units. Developing projection neurons initially overproduce nascent collaterals in the early pupa. The set of nascent collaterals that mature and eventually bear boutons is conditional on Kenyon cell number, thereby executing scaling. Finally, early boutons bear filopodia that frequently contact neighboring projection neuron processes, suggesting that bouton-bouton interactions contribute to shaping these structures.",

      "title": "The modular nature of long-association pathways in the human brain",
      "content": "Human brain functions are organized within large-scale networks, yet the long-range structural pathways that support them remain only partly understood. Diffusion MRI tractography has enabled non-invasive mapping of these connections but its low resolution has also contributed to a view of white matter association bundles as monolithic entities linking distant cortical regions. This contrasts with anatomical studies in non-human primates and humans, which show these bundles act as conduits for complex systems of short- and long-range projections. Here we investigate the dorsal branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF-I), the proposed structural backbone of the dorsal attention network, whose anatomy in humans is debated. Using anatomic tracing, polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography, and in vivo and ex vivo diffusion MRI, we reconstruct the SLF-I across species, modalities, and scales. High resolution tractography (<750 m), consistent with tracer and PS-OCT data, reveals multiple fiber systems of varying lengths rather than uniform parieto-frontal connections observed at more conventional resolution (1.5 mm). Comparative analyses show a consistent organization: the SLF-I carries short-range cortico-cortical projections rostral to area 6 and longer, layered connections extending to parietal regions, while direct parieto-frontal connectivity is mostly supported by the adjacent cingulum bundle. These findings reconcile our understanding of the SLF-I across the scales of non-invasive neuroimaging and invasive anatomic studies and provide an updated framework for future investigations of large-scale networks in health and disease.",
