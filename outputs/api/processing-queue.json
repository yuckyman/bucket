      "title": "Finite element model predicts micromotion-induced strain profiles that correlate with the functional performance of Utah arrays in humans and non-human primates",
      "content": "Objective. Utah arrays are widely used in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) for intracortical brain\u2013computer interfaces, primarily for detecting electrical signals from cortical tissue to decode motor commands. Recently, these arrays have also been applied to deliver electrical stimulation aimed at restoring sensory functions. A key challenge limiting their longevity is the micromotion between the array and cortical tissue, which may induce mechanical strain in surrounding tissue and contribute to performance decline. This strain, due to mechanical mismatch, can exacerbate glial scarring around the implant, reducing the efficacy of Utah arrays in recording neuronal activity and delivering electrical stimulation. Approach. To investigate this, we employed a finite element model to predict tissue strains resulting from micromotion. Main results. Our findings indicated that strain profiles around edge and corner electrodes were greater than those around interior shanks, affecting both maximum and average strains within 50 \u00b5m of the electrode tip. We then correlated these predicted tissue strains with in-vivo electrode performance metrics. We found negative correlations between 1 kHz impedance and tissue strains in human motor arrays and NHP area V4 arrays at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-implantation. In human motor arrays, the peak-to-peak waveform voltage and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spontaneous activity were also negatively correlated with strain. Conversely, we observed a positive correlation between the evoked SNR of multi-unit activity and strain in NHP area V4 arrays. Significance. This study establishes a spatial dependence of electrode performance in Utah arrays that correlates with tissue strain.",

      "title": "Iris 128x: open-source 128 channel headstages for neural stimulation and recording",
      "content": "Objective. Investigation into complex neural circuits necessitates interfaces capable of high channel count recording and stimulation. However, existing commercial neural headstages often have limited scalability, restrictive proprietary designs, and constrained bidirectional capabilities, which worsens accessibility challenges and compels researchers to reinvent tools rather than build on a shared foundation. Approach. Here, we present two open-source, 128 channel headstages\u2014Iris 128B and Iris 128S\u2014designed for integration with microelectrode arrays. The Iris 128B enables fully bidirectional interfacing, with stimulation or recording across all 128 electrode channels, while the Iris 128S provides recording on 128 channels and stimulation on 16 simultaneous channels, which can be assigned to any 16 of the 32 available stimulation channels. Both designs use Intan Technologies\u2019 RHS and RHD series integrated circuits for amplification, filtering, digitization and stimulation, and are available on GitHub. Main results. The headstages were validated through benchtop impedance, noise, and frequency response measurements, as well as acute in vivo recordings in an anesthetized rat. Results demonstrate low noise levels and reliable signal acquisition across all channels. Significance. By releasing fully documented printed circuit board designs for headstages, this work aims to take a step towards broader adoption of bidirectional recording and stimulation systems while increasing channel counts. Future iterations will focus on miniaturization and wireless integration to improve usability in chronic and freely moving small animal experiments.",

      "title": "A gene expression atlas of a juvenile nervous system",
      "content": "Although the fundamental architecture of metazoan nervous systems is typically established in the embryo, substantial numbers of neurons are added during post-natal development while existing neurons expand in size, refine connectivity, and undergo additional differentiation. To reveal the underlying molecular determinants of post-embryonic neurogenesis and maturation, we have produced gene expression profiles of all neuron types and their progenitors in the first larval stage (L1) of C. elegans. Comparisons of the L1 profile to the embryo and to the later L4 larval stage identified thousands of differentially expressed genes across individual neurons throughout the nervous system. Key neuropeptide signaling networks, for example, are remodeled during larval development. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed potential transcription factors driving the temporal changes in gene expression across the nervous system, including a broad role for the heterochronic gene lin-14. We utilized available connectomic data of juvenile animals in combination with our neuron-specific atlas to identify potential molecular determinants of membrane contact and synaptic connectivity. These expression data are available through a user-friendly interface at CeNGEN.org for independent investigations of the maturation, connectivity and function of a developing nervous system.",

      "content": "The human oral microbiome is increasingly recognized as a contributor to brain health, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous work revealed that oral Actinomyces species was enriched in chronic cannabis smokers. Here, we show oral inoculation of cannabis use-associated Actinomyces species, especially A. meyeri, to wildtype C57BL/6 mice leads to anxiety-like behaviors, non-region-specific microglia activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced GABAergic neurotransmission, without evidence of bacterial translocation to the brain, neuroinflammation, and memory decline. Notably, Actinomyces species producing metabolites, i.e., arginine and argininosuccinate, were increased in both oral swabs and brain following inoculation in vivo. These Actinomyces species-producing metabolites induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurons in vitro, indicating a neuropathogenic role and aligning with reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in vivo. Together, these results suggest that oral cannabis-associated dysbiosis impacts behavior through mitochondrial stress and impaired inhibitory signaling, indicating the oral to brain metabolic axis is potentially consequential in neuropsychiatric disorders.",
