      "title": "Age-related inflammatory changes and perineuronal net dynamics: implications for neurodegenerative disorders.",
      "content": "Background: Healthy aging alone can lead to cognitive decline, decreased brain size, protein aggregation, accumulation of senescent cells and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Age-related neuroinflammation, as known as inflammaging, is thought to restrict brain plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular matrix structures surrounding fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, regulate plasticity and protect neurons from oxidative stress. Given the known impact of inflammaging on neural circuits, this study examines age-associated changes in PNN homeostasis, glial activation, and neuroinflammation in two brain regions relevant to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We analyzed young (4-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) C57BL/6J male mice for several behavioral phenotypes [hippocampal-dependent spatial learning using the Barnes maze; locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors using Open field and T-maze]. Using immunostaining, PNNs (Wisteria floribunda agglutinin and aggrecan), PV interneurons, and microglial activation (Iba1) were quantified in both the hippocampus and dorsal striatum. Glial morphology was examined using a battery of cell body, branching, and endpoint analyses. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze changes in the gene expression of inflammatory and extracellular matrix markers. Results: Aged mice exhibited hippocampal-dependent memory deficits without alterations in locomotion or anxiety-related behavior. PNN counts increased in the aged hippocampus, particularly in CA2, with a higher proportion of WFA and aggrecan PNNs. In contrast, PNN homeostasis was maintained in the dorsal striatum. In general, Aged mice showed increases in microglial activation and a subset of inflammatory markers. We report brain region- and age- specific gene expression changes in complement, matrix metalloproteinases, and other inflammatory markers. Aged striatal microglia displayed an activated morphology with larger cell bodies and reduced branching, as well as increased expression of markers for microgliosis (Iba1, TREM2, CD68). Conclusions: These findings suggest that aging differentially affects neuroinflammation and PNN integrity across brain regions. The hippocampus exhibits PNN accumulation, neuroinflammation, and behavioral changes, whereas the striatum maintains PNN homeostasis concurrent with increased microglial activation. This work suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to age-related changes in PNNs and behavior underscoring the importance of region-specific therapeutic strategies targeting PNN regulation.",

      "content": "This paper presents an approach of combining Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) signals to create a hybrid Brain Interface Computer (BCI) device for controlling a hand exoskeleton through classifying the flexion attempt and resting states of the subjects. We analyzed data of 51 healthy and patients with brain lesions that involved the motor cortex and different hand movement disorders. Their EMG and EEG activity were recorded while the subjects attempted to move their index finger. The signals are analyzed through deep neural network, restricted Boltzmann machine and LDA classifier methods to access a reliable accuracy. Further, to evaluate the proposed approach, we designed and implemented a robotic system for rehabilitation of the hand movement to show that it is able to derive assistive control, by detecting flexion movement from the signals as a command and send it to robot. The system is combined with control signals that determine the information of flexion according to measured EMG signals.",

      "title": "Building the blood-brain barrier: a scalable self-assembling 3D model of the brain microvasculature under unidirectional flow",
      "content": "The blood vessels of the central nervous (CNS) system form a tight, protective blood-brain barrier (BBB). This barrier is essential for healthy CNS function but also poses a hurdle in the treatment of increasingly common neurological disorders. Additionally, BBB dysfunction is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, further emphasizing a need for a better understanding of BBB function in health and disease. We present a human self-assembling 3D model of the BBB in a microfluidic cell culture platform that allows culture of 48 models in parallel on one tissue culture plate. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes form highly reproducible BBB vascular networks under unidirectional perfusion and remain viable for a minimum of 14 days. Immunostaining reveals close cell-cell interactions with pericytes and astrocyte end-feet in direct contact with the brain microvasculature. Compared to endothelial monocultures, co-culture with astrocytes or pericytes results in improved barrier function, lower vessel diameters, increased branching, and alignment of the vessels in the direction of fluid flow. These results were most pronounced in tri-cultures containing all three cell types. Unlike similar models previously reported, this brain microvasculature model allows for unidirectional perfusion without the need for pumps and syringes. Combined with its high-throughput nature, this feature renders the model suitable for studies of BBB function in health and disease, and assessment of potential BBB restorative therapies.",

      "title": "Temporal dynamics of neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration in the central auditory system following noise-induced hearing loss: A multimodal imaging and histological study",
      "content": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a sensorineural disorder that triggers profound neuroplastic and neurodegenerative consequences in the central auditory nervous system (CNS). This study examined how neuronal density, axonal integrity and glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission are affected after acute overstimulation in the central inferior colliculus (CIC) and the ventral medial geniculate body of the thalamus (MGV). To achieve this, a correlative multimodal approach combining audiometric, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological biomarkers was performed. Adult mice were noise-exposed to broadband white noise (5-20 kHz) for 3 hours at either high (115 dB SPL) or moderate (90 dB SPL) intensity, while unexposed mice were used as controls. Separate cohorts of mice were investigated 1-, 7-, 56- and 84-days post-exposure using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter density (GMD), diffusion MRI (dMRI) of microstructure and connectivity, and single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) for glutamate and GABA quantification. Frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded at 4, 8, 16 and 32 kHz before and after exposure to examine hearing threshold (HT) shifts. Following imaging, brains were processed for fluorescence immunohistochemistry (FIHC) targeting Neuronal Nuclear Protein (NeuN), 4',6-diamidino-2-fenilindo (DAPI), Neurofilament (SMI312), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and vesicular glutamate transporters 1 (VGLUT1) and 2 (VGLUT2). HTs were significantly elevated 7d, 56d and 84d after 115 dB noise exposure, suggesting a NIHL phenotype. Neurofilament density significantly increased in the CIC and MGV 1d after 115 dB noise exposure, and returned to baseline at later time points. dMRI transient microstructural alterations were observed 7d after 90 dB noise exposure. Glutamate and GABA decreases 84d after 90 dB exposure were also detected. Moreover, correlation analysis between audiometric, histological and MRI datasets revealed scarce relationships between the investigated parameters. These findings advance our understanding of the CNS adaptations of NIHL and emphasizes the need for more sensitive and integrative approaches to identify robust biomarkers of central auditory dysfunction.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",
