      "content": "<p>Hi HN! In the past few months my team and I have been working on Tusk Drift, a system that records real API traffic from your service, then replays those requests as deterministic tests. Outbound I/O (databases, HTTP calls, etc.) gets automatically mocked using the recorded data.<p>Problem we're trying to solve: Writing API tests is tedious, and hand-written mocks drift from reality. We wanted tests that stay realistic because they come from real traffic.<p>versus mocking libraries: Tools like VCR/Nock intercept HTTP within your tests. Tusk Drift records full request/response traces externally (HTTP, DB, Redis, etc.) and replays them against your running service, no test code or fixtures to write/maintain.<p>How it works:<p>1. Add a lightweight SDK (we currently support Python and Node.js)<p>2. Record traffic in any environment.<p>3. Run `tusk run`, the CLI sandboxes your service and serves mocks via Unix socket<p>We run this in CI on every PR. Also been using it as a test harness for AI coding agents, they can make changes, run `tusk run`, and get immediate feedback without needing live dependencies.<p>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli</a><p>Demo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo</a><p>Happy to answer questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637322\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637322</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

Using a chronic interferon-alpha-induced rat model of depression, we show acute psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) reverses impaired reward-induced biases within 24hrs, with effects enduring for at least 7 days. This suggests psilocybin can restore blunted reward processing, an effect which could significantly contribute to its sustained antidepressant effects.",

Developing methods to reopen the CP after its closure could lead to the establishment of effective treatment approaches. The retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) undergo experience-dependent remodeling only during the limited period of development. We investigated the effects of astrocyte manipulation on the restoration of RG synapse plasticity after the CP termination. Astrocytic stimulation with the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) after the CP closure caused RG synapse remodeling in the dark-reared mice but not in those reared in normal conditions. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of dLGN astrocytes implicated the underlying mechanisms of astrocyte-induced RG synaptic plasticity. Therefore, astrocytes can regulate the susceptibility of RG synapses to experience-dependent plasticity after CP termination.",

      "title": "SnapG: An Automated Tool for Myelin g-ratio Measurement with Batch Processing Capability",
      "content": "The g-ratio, calculated as the axon diameter divided by the total myelinated fiber diameter, is widely used to assess the degree of myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Changes in g-ratios accompany demyelinating, hypomyelinating, and remyelinating conditions, and can also result from activity-dependent, adaptive myelination. Although manual tracing from electron micrographs has been the gold-standard to measure g-ratios, this process is laborious and limits throughput. To address this challenge, we developed SnapG, an automated and user friendly software tool to streamline g-ratio analysis from electron micrographs. SnapG implements an end to end pipeline for axon and myelin segmentation on EM images. The tool integrates robust segmentation and post processing steps to extract axon and fiber diameters and generates both per image and cohort level summary statistics. SnapG produces g-ratio distributions that agree well with expert manual annotations and established tools across imaging modalities. It reduces user intervention, supports large image and batch processing, and achieves faster processing times while delivering accurate, reproducible measurements. SnapG's automated reporting thereby facilitates high throughput analyses and improves consistency across experiments. SnapG can accelerate studies of myelin biology and provides a practical alternative to existing tools.",

      "content": "<p>There are 8.2 billion humans on earth.</p>\n<p>We're extremely dynamic. You will meet people all through your life with different personalities, skills, and interests. This individual uniqueness not only makes life more interesting, but it also increases our collective ability to handle a wide range of ideas and problems.</p>\n<p>Despite these capabilities, our differences can also lead to an overwhelming feeling of division in some. Differences often lead to disagreement, anger, hostility, or violence. To say humans don't often inflict cruelty on one another would be a lie. We absolutely have shown our teeth. In innumerable ways, we've caused horror to our own species. We've dehumanized, caused suffering, and in many cases killed one another.</p>\n<p>In many ways, we're still learning. Humanity is still growing. A lot of people are trying to sort right from wrong, fair from unfair, true from untrue. This leads to a lot of confusion, a lot of chaos, and a lot of violence. To see humans go after other humans in such efficient and relentless manners is terrifying and beyond disheartening. It can be easy to lose hope, but the truth is... <em>none of it is necessary.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>None of the violence, none of the hate, none of the inequality is mandatory.</strong></em></p>\n<p>We are allowed to go against the grain of things we know are wrong. <em>We are allowed to improve our world.</em> Never be scared to do what you know is right, even when its hard, even when it might benefit someone else more than yourself. Match relentless selfishness with your own relentless generosity. Resist chaos and confusion with serenity and understanding. Engulf violence with endless harmony.</p>\n<p>Remember that truth doesn't rely on anyone. Truth doesn't ask for our opinions. Truth is eternal, unwavering, and it will always be there, waiting for us to realize what we're capable of together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em><strong>In this world there\u2019s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</strong></em> Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. <em><strong>More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.</strong></em>&quot; - Charlie Chaplin</li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Modafinil Modulation of Oscillatory and Aperiodic Brain Activity in Rats Across Wakefulness and Subsequent Sleep",
      "content": "Cortical states shape sensory processing, decision-making, and behavior, and are characterized by distinct patterns of neuronal oscillatory activity. Pharmacological agents can modulate these states and their underlying electrophysiological signatures. Modafinil is a widely used wake-promoting agent and cognitive enhancer, but its effects on cortical oscillations are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of modafinil on cortical activity during wakefulness and subsequent sleep. Ten male Wistar rats were implanted with electrocorticographic electrodes and recorded following oral administration of modafinil or its vehicle. Our results show that modafinil increased wakefulness in a dose-dependent manner, with doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg producing prolonged wake episodes and reducing hypnogram complexity. During wakefulness, modafinil enhanced gamma-band power in anterior cortices, an effect primarily driven by increases in the aperiodic rather than oscillatory components. Although no sleep rebound was observed, subsequent NREM sleep exhibited increased delta power, particularly in anterior regions, indicating heightened sleep pressure. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that modafinil-induced wakefulness is associated with an enhanced aperiodic gamma band component at the anterior cortices in the EEG. Furthermore, modafinil modulates sleep homeostasis by enhancing NREM sleep intensity rather than extending its duration.",

      "title": "Wasf1 deletion attenuates tau hyperphosphorylation, microglial state transition, and cognitive deficits in P301S tau mice",
      "content": "We previously reported that WAVE1, a major activator of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization, is downregulated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that WAVE1 regulates amyloid precursor protein trafficking and amyloid-{beta} production. However, its role in tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WAVE1 activity is suppressed in P301S tau mice through elevated inhibitory phosphorylation. Strikingly, WAVE1 gene (Wasf1) knockout in P301S tau mice significantly reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and improves cognition, suggesting a compensatory role for WAVE1 suppression in tau pathogenesis. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals that Wasf1 deletion in P301S tau mice reverses microglial state transitions, with minimal impact on other brain cell types. Wasf1 mRNA is highly translated in microglia in non-Tg mice, while its expression is downregulated in P301S tau mice. Wasf1 knockdown in BV2 microglia cells enhances the degradation of engulfed tau fibrils, indicating WAVE1 as an endogenous regulator of microglial function. Additionally, CellChat analysis indicates that Wasf1 deletion alters microglial autocrine signaling and their interactions with other cell types in P301S tau mice. These findings, taken together, suggest that Wasf1 deletion restores homeostatic microglial function, mitigates tau pathology, and alleviates cognitive deficits, highlighting WAVE1 as a potential therapeutic target for tauopathy-related dementias.",
