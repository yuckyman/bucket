      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the effect of enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia (BG-EPVS) on interstitial fluid (ISF) content in white matter and to assess the mediating role of deep medullary vein (DMV) dysfunction in this relationship among patients with cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).MethodsMagnetic resonance imaging and clinical data were collected from 166 patients with CSVD. EPVS score (0\u20134) was evaluated on T2-weighted images on the basis of the number of EPVS in a single slice. DMV score (0\u201318) was assigned on susceptibility-weighted imaging according to signal continuity and clarity. Free water (FW) values, representing ISF content in white matter, were derived from diffusion tensor imaging.ResultsThe mean age of the participants was 63.6 \u00b1 11.1 years. The median score was as follows: BG-EPVS, 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); centrum semiovale EPVS (CSO-EPVS), 1 (IQR: 1\u20132); CSVD score, 1 (IQR: 0\u20132), and DMV, 4 (IQR: 1\u201311). The mean FW values were 0.25 \u00b1 0.02. No significant correlation was observed between CSO-EPVS and FW (r = 0.112, p = 0.119). In contrast, BG-EPVS showed a moderate positive correlation with both DMV score (r = 0.594, p < 0.001) and FW (r = 0.521, p < 0.001). DMV score was also moderate positively correlated with FW (r = 0.557, p < 0.001). These associations remained significant after adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors (all p < 0.05). Mediation analysis confirmed that DMV score significantly mediated the relationship between BG-EPVS and FW, independent of covariates.ConclusionHigher BG-EPVS score is significantly associated with increased ISF content in white matter, with DMV dysfunction serving as a key mediator of this association.",

      "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",

      "title": "Amorphous silicon resistors enable smaller pixels in photovoltaic retinal prosthesis",
      "content": "Objective. Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 \u00b5m pixel width. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material\u2014doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 \u00b5m. Approach. To fit within a few \u00b5m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M\u03a9 range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few 100 k\u03a9 sq\u22121, which translates to resistivity of a few \u03a9 * cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M\u03a9 on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 \u00b5m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A W\u22121, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21%\u201331 % when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54%\u201355 % decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16%\u201322 % with no shunt to 22%\u201334 % with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a M\u03a9 range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100\u202f\u00b5m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.",

      "title": "An interpretable generative multimodal neuroimaging-genomics framework for decoding Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Objective. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. Approach. We propose a multimodal deep learning (DL)-based classification framework where a generative module employing cycle generative adversarial networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features\u2019 relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Main results. Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of (CI [0.90, 0.95]) and (CI [0.70, 0.72]) in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. Significance. Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.",

      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
      "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

      "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

      "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
      "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",
