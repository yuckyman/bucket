      "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",

      "title": "D1R-specific modulation of ACC mitigates chronic neuropathic pain",
      "content": "Maladaptive plasticity within central pain circuits is a defining feature of chronic neuropathic pain, yet the mechanisms governing these changes remain unclear. This study investigates the role of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathway in the neuropathic pain-induced hyperexcitability of dopamine D1 receptor-expressing anterior cingulate cortex (ACCD1R) neurons. We find that infusing D1R agonists in the ACC reverses the mechanical hypersensitivity and negative affective-motivational affect in mice caused by spared-nerve injury (SNI). Although ACC pyramidal neurons are widely presumed to be the principal targets of D1R signaling, ex vivo recordings reveal that D1R agonists suppress the excitability of D1R-expressing pyramidal neurons while enhancing the excitability of D1R-expressing interneurons. Consistently, gene-expression analyses show that D1R-expression is distributed across both excitatory and inhibitory ACC neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the excitability of genetically labeled D1R pyramidal neurons is enhanced by SNI, whereas in interneurons, it is reduced. Chemogenetic manipulation demonstrates that activation of D1R neurons produces robust analgesic and anxiolytic effects, whereas inhibition worsens pain- and anxiety-related behaviours, indicating that inhibitory D1R neurons dominate population-level output. Circuit tracing further delineates diverse afferent and efferent connections linking ACCD1R neurons to sensory and affective pain pathways. Together, these results identify dopaminergic regulation of ACCD1R neurons as a critical determinant of cortical dysfunction in chronic pain.",

      "title": "Microglia stabilize sleep homeostasis via adenosine A3 receptor signaling",
      "content": "Sleep homeostasis maintains the sleep-wake balance through sleep pressure, a process orchestrated by the accumulation of extracellular adenosine (eADO). Microglial Ca2+ activity has been implicated in sleep regulation, but the mechanism whereby microglia sense sleep pressure remains unclear. Here we show that microglia regulate sleep homeostasis through brain state-dependent Ca2+ activity driven by adenosine A3 receptor (A3R) signaling. Using miniaturized two-photon microscopy (mTPM) in freely behaving mice, we demonstrate that microglial Ca2+ activity is rapidly altered by brain-state transitions. Pharmacological experiments reveal that microglial Ca2+ dynamics are predominantly mediated by A3R in response to brain state-dependent eADO oscillations. Microglia-specific deletion of A3R attenuates these state-dependent Ca2+ dynamics, impairs microglial morphological plasticity across sleep-wake cycles, and leads to sleep fragmentation by increasing transitions between wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Together, these findings establish that microglia regulate sleep homeostasis by stabilizing both wakefulness and NREM sleep, a process critically dependent on eADO-A3R signaling.",
