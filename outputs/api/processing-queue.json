      "title": "Tell HN: Regrets. Think carefully about how you spend your time",
      "content": "<p>I'm writing this 38 hours before I go into a surgery on Monday that I may not survive, and while I am told I have a better than 50/50 chance of making it to this time next year, I still feel, though I am too young (early 50s) to deal with these things, that I have wasted too much time. I'd like to impart some lessons.<p>1. A small number of accomplishments really mean something, but you often won't know which ones. I started three companies and two were successes, and even though they comprised more than two decades of my life, I feel like I remember a grand total of six important hours between them. Meanwhile, I still remember the shed I built for my father in the first summer after college. Whatever seems unimportant, you will care about the most.<p>2. The thing you do today, you will probably do tomorrow. I've wasted a lot of time, but most people I know have wasted lots of time, and it's because of the tendency to make an exception of the present day, which either excuses laziness or pathological busyness, which is a form of the same thing. \"I'll do it tomorrow.\" But tomorrow it will be today. It's always today.<p>3. Ethics matter. I don't believe there's any life after this one, but I find myself ruminating on what I've done. In 2015, I had a lot of interaction with a startup incubator you know well, and ended up sitting in the discussions and planning around banning and erasing a young programmer we considered a threat to our financial interests, due to his concerns about authoritarianism in technology. In retrospect, he was harmless, but an example had to be made. The decision was made to ban him here, try to get him fired though I don't know if we succeeded, and attack him with sockpuppets on Reddit, and it seems to have worked because you don't hear his name much.<p>Ten years later, I'm still stuck thinking about this. Am I the kind of person who does shitty things? I was. Am I still? How would I even know?<p>I don't believe that faith is an out, or that you can apologize or donate your way out of past behaviors. You will always be the person who has done what you have done.<p>4. Be kind to animals. There are few joys like having a dog. I always refused when my ex-wife wanted one, and she got one after we separated. For her, it was probably an upgrade.<p>5. I developed a knack for founding companies, but I never learned how to build communities. They aren't the same thing. You might have three hundred people at your company and you truly feel like they are your village, but they're not. Circumstances will change, and people will move, and in five years, most of them will not remember your name.<p>That's probably enough for now. My mind goes between periods of racing and long spells of languid acceptance. All humans end up in the place where I am, and I hope you reach it with fewer regrets than I have.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46092688\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46092688</a></p>\n<p>Points: 84</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve just released <strong>SentinelNav</strong>, a pure Python tool that creates interactive spectral maps of binary files to visualize their internal &quot;geography.&quot; It runs entirely on the standard library (no <code>pip install</code> required).</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Analyzing raw binary files (forensics, reverse engineering, or file validation) is difficult because:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hex Dumps are dense:</strong> Reading 50MB of hex code to find where a text section ends and an encrypted payload begins is mentally exhausting and slow.</li> <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> It is hard to distinguish between compressed data, random noise, and machine code just by looking at values.</li> <li><strong>Dependency Hell:</strong> Many existing visualization tools require heavy GUI frameworks (Qt) or complex environment setups just to perform a quick check.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Solution: SentinelNav</strong></p> <p>I built a deterministic engine that transforms binary data into visual clusters:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Spectral Mapping:</strong> It maps byte values to RGB colors. High-bit bytes (compiled code/media) appear Red, printable ASCII appears Green, and nulls/padding appear Blue. This allows you to visually identify file headers and sections instantly.</li> <li><strong>Architecture Heuristics:</strong> It scans raw binary chunks to detect headers (PE, ELF, Mach-O) and attempts to guess the CPU architecture (x86 vs ARM64) based on instruction alignment and opcode frequency.</li> <li><strong>Entropy Analysis:</strong> It calculates Shannon entropy per block to detect anomalies, such as &quot;Flux events&quot; where data transitions from structured to random (encryption boundaries).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example / How to Run</strong></p> <p>Since it relies on the standard library, it works out of the box:</p> <pre><code># No dependencies to install python3 sentinelnav.py my_firmware.bin </code></pre> <p>This spawns a local web server. You can then open your browser to:</p> <ol> <li>Navigate the file map using <strong>WASD</strong> keys (like a game).</li> <li>Click colored blocks to inspect the <strong>Hex Dump</strong> and <strong>ArchID</strong> analysis.</li> <li>Export the visualization as a <strong>.BMP</strong> image.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Reverse Engineers, CTF players, Security Analysts, and developers interested in file structures.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Binwalk:</strong> Great for extraction, but lacks interactive visualization.</li> <li><strong>Veles / Cantordust:</strong> Powerful but often unmaintained or require complex installations.</li> <li><strong>SentinelNav:</strong> Focuses on being lightweight, zero-dependency, and &quot;drop-and-run&quot; compatible with any system that has Python 3 installed.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Uses <code>concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor</code> to crunch entropy math across all CPU cores.</li> <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Uses an ephemeral <code>sqlite3</code> database to index analysis chunks, allowing it to paginate through files larger than available RAM.</li> <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> A custom HTML5 Canvas rendering engine embedded directly in the Python script.</li> <li><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/smolfiddle/SentinelNav\">https://github.com/smolfiddle/SentinelNav</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FiddleSmol\"> /u/FiddleSmol </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pa91j5/i_built_sentinelnav_a_zerodependency_binary_file/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pa91j5/i_built_sentinelnav_a_zerodependency_binary_file/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Single-channel EEG-based sleep stage classification via hybrid data distillation",
      "content": "Objective. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, more and more researchers have begun developing end-to-end automatic sleep stage classification frameworks. However, these frameworks typically require access to large electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets for training, which imposes a significant computational burden. Furthermore, EEG data contains patient privacy information, and using such data for training raises concerns about privacy infringement. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid data distillation method. We aim to enable single-channel EEG sleep stage classification with less training cost and privacy risk by distilling large real datasets into a tiny, privacy-preserving synthetic set for training from scratch. Approach. We first apply the gradient matching method to optimize the randomly initialized synthetic dataset. The gradient changes in the early stages of model training can quickly reduce the performance gap between the synthetic dataset and the source dataset. Subsequently, to avoid oscillations near the optimal solution during gradient matching, we switch to distribution matching to further optimize the synthetic dataset. This method aligns the data distribution at a global level, enhancing overall consistency. In addition, we adopt a novel mini-batch iteration method to assist the synthetic dataset in learning temporal dependencies. Main results. We validated our framework on three public datasets and achieved robust results. Significance. This study proposes an efficient and robust hybrid data distillation algorithm, providing a feasible approach for implementing sleep stage staging based on privacy protection.",
