      "title": "Brain dynamics of attentional, default-mode and limbic networks are disrupted at rest in Post-COVID-19 Syndrome",
      "content": "Background Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is characterised by persistent fatigue, cognitive impairment, and affective symptoms, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Although resting-state neuroimaging studies have reported alterations in static functional connectivity, such approaches fail to capture the brain's intrinsically dynamic organisation. Cognitive and emotional functions depend on the flexible reconfiguration of large-scale brain networks over time; disruptions in the exploration of, and transitions between, functional brain states may therefore play a key role in PCS pathophysiology. Methods Resting-state functional MRI data were acquired from 20 individuals with PCS (mean age = 41.8 +/- 9.4 years) and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (mean age = 40.6 +/- 8.1 years) using a multi-echo acquisition. Following denoising with multi-echo independent component analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA) was applied to identify recurrent patterns of whole-brain phase synchrony. The optimal number of dynamic brain states was determined using the Dunn index. For each state, probability of occurrence, lifetime, and transition probabilities were quantified, and spatial topographies were mapped onto canonical functional networks. Group differences were assessed using ANCOVAs controlling for age, sex, and handedness. Exploratory associations with clinical symptoms, cognitive performance, and peripheral inflammatory markers were examined using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Results Five recurrent dynamic brain states were identified. Compared with controls, individuals with PCS showed a reduced probability of occurrence and shorter lifetime of a visual/dorsal attention state, alongside an increased probability of a limbic/default mode network (DMN) state. PCS was further characterised by reduced transitions between visual/dorsal attention and frontoparietal/DMN states, and increased transitions from somatomotor/visual states toward the limbic/DMN configuration. Exploratory analyses revealed that greater expression of the limbic/DMN state was associated with poorer global cognitive performance (MoCA) and higher serum interleukin-1 beta levels. Conclusions PCS is associated with a reorganisation of intrinsic brain dynamics, marked by a shift from externally oriented attentional states toward limbic/DMN configurations. This pattern suggests reduced cognitive flexibility and increased weighting of interoceptive or affective signals. The observed associations between dynamic brain-state expression, cognitive dysfunction, and peripheral inflammation support a systems-level mechanism through which immune signalling may influence large-scale neural dynamics in PCS. Dynamic functional connectivity provides a sensitive framework for characterising post-viral brain dysfunction and may inform future mechanistic models and therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Anterior insula activity during alcohol and social reward self-administration and choice in male and female rats",
      "content": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by the prioritization of alcohol over healthier non-alcohol rewards, posing significant challenges for addiction treatment. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving this maladaptive preference is crucial for effective intervention. We previously showed that rats will choose alcohol over social reward in a discrete-choice task. Here, we used fiber photometry to investigate how anterior insula cortex (aIC) activity relates to choice and employed Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) modelling to dissect the underlying decision processes. Male and female rats, transfected with calcium indicator jGCaMP7f in aIC, were trained to lever-press for either social reward or alcohol (20% ethanol) in alternating sessions, followed by discrete-choice sessions, and then punishment of alcohol choices. Rats developed a preference for alcohol over social reward, which was reversed when alcohol choices were punished. Model output successfully described this behaviour with the model-derived 'decision bias' tracking preference across all phases. Photometry recordings showed that, as alcohol preference emerged, increased aIC activity during the cue period preceding alcohol choices (relative to social choices) was significantly correlated with decision bias towards alcohol. During punishment, aIC activity bias was no longer related to decision bias, despite the preference shift. These results demonstrate that aIC activity is linked to alcohol reward and choice and suggest that aIC contributes to alcohol preference by encoding a bias in the evidence accumulation process. This highlights a specific role of aIC in the cognitive mechanisms of alcohol-seeking, and its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions.",

      "title": "A Birdcage Volume Transmit Coil and 8 Channel Receive Array for Marmoset Brain Imaging at 7T",
      "content": "Objective: To design and fabricate a band-pass birdcage volume resonator and eight channel, conformal receive array coil for MRI of both awake and anesthetized marmoset brain at 7T. The coil is compatible with a whole body 7T clinical MRI scanner running in single channel transmit (sTx) mode. Methods: The marmoset head coil included a shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil with 24 legs, as well as 8 overlapped receive elements. Electromagnetic (EM) field simulation was performed for the 24 leg band pass birdcage Tx coil to calculate the B1+ efficiency. The efficacy of both transmit and receive coil designs were evaluated by measuring standard coil performance metrics. This was done while imaging a marmoset head phantom, as well as by acquiring in vivo, anesthetized and awake marmoset images. Results: The transmit coil along with the optimized receive array produced high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic for EPI images; 0.36 mm isotropic for structural images) and high SNR (between 50 and 80) images of the marmoset brain. The simulated B1+ efficiency of the birdcage at the center of the phantom was 2.6 \u00b5T/sqrt (W). Conclusion and significance: A shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil was designed and fabricated for marmoset brain imaging at 7T. An 8-channel receive array consisting of eight overlapped loops, covering the whole brain of the marmoset, was also constructed and applied for signal reception. The system successfully allowed scanning of both young and older marmosets. It is well-suited for longitudinal studies of marmoset brain structure. The coil advantageously allows the study of neurodevelopment and primate brain function.",

      "content": "Objective: To develop a transceiver radio frequency (RF) coil optimized for high resolution small-animal imaging at 14.1 T, aimed at enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Methods: A hybrid distributed capacitance (HDC) birdcage coil was designed, combining conventional endring lumped capacitors with distributed capacitance along the legs, implemented using double-layer copper-clad substrates. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations were employed to optimize the coil's structural parameters and capacitance values for maximum RF performance. The HDC birdcage coil's performance was evaluated against a conventional bandpass (BP) design through electromagnetic simulations, bench tests, and phantom imaging. In vivo validation was performed using mouse imaging. Results: EM simulations demonstrated that the HDC design enhances mean $\\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ and $\\text{B}_{1}^{-}$ field strengths by 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, relative to the conventional BP design. The HDC design also showed reduced electric field (E-field) value in phantom, with 4.2% lower mean and 11.4% lower maximum E-field value. Bench measurements revealed a superior quality factor (Q factor) for the HDC coil, with a 34.2% higher unloaded Q value compared to the conventional design. Phantom imaging confirmed a 41% SNR improvement with the HDC design. The optimized HDC coil enabled mouse brain imaging at 50 $ \\!\\!\\mu \\!\\!\\text{ m}$ resolution.Conclusion: The proposed HDC birdcage coil demonstrated superior receiver sensitivity and Q factor compared to conventional designs, yielding significant SNR improvements in 14.1 T imaging. Significance: The results demonstrated the feasibility of achieving enhanced coil performance through HDC design at ultra-high field strength, providing a promising approach for improving image quality in small-animal MRI applications.",

However, both cocaine- and caffeine-induced locomotor activity can be blocked by non-selective dopamine receptor antagonists, implying that we may not be able to distinguish their locomotor activity at the level of the dopamine receptor-mediated mechanism. With the rationale that this limitation may be due to a lack of sensitivity of current methods, we have developed a new Quantitative Structure of Curve Analytical (QSCAn) model. We hypothesized that QSCAn will be more effective, relative to the current model, in differentiating the dopamine receptor-mediated mechanism of cocaine versus caffeine-induced locomotor activity. Methods: We assessed locomotor activity (quantified as distance traveled in cm over time) due to injections of saline (n = 6), cocaine (10 mg/kg i.p, n = 8) and caffeine (20 mg/kg i.p, n = 6) in male Sprague Dawley rats with and without pretreatment with vehicle and cis-flupenthixol (0.2 mg/kg i.p, non-selective dopamine receptor blocker)(current model). Because distance traveled over time follows an inverted u-shaped time-response curve, we employed gaussian fit of this structure to obtain several behavioral variables (QSCAn model). We compared both models. Results: The current model could not distinguish the locomotor activity profile of cocaine versus caffeine following vehicle and cis-flupenthixol pretreatments. QSCAn model could distinguish cocaine versus caffeine in the presence and absence of non-selective dopamine receptor blockade. Conclusions: The new QSCAn model may be a promising tool to distinguish/characterize different psychostimulant-related effects.",
