      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I wanted to share a code execution framework/library that I recently published, called \u201cdarl\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Mitstake/darl\">https://github.com/mitstake/darl</a></p> <p><strong>What my project does:</strong></p> <p>Darl is a lightweight code execution framework that transparently provides incremental computations, caching, scenario/shock analysis, parallel/distributed execution and more. The code you write closely resembles standard python code with some structural conventions added to automatically unlock these abilities. There\u2019s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.</p> <p>Darl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>The motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>The closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the &quot;Alternatives&quot; section of the README.</p> <p><strong>Quick Demo</strong></p> <p>Here is a quick working snippet. This snippet on it's own doesn't describe much in terms of features (check our the README for that), it serves only to show the similarities between darl code and standard python code, however, these minor differences unlock powerful capabilities.</p> <pre><code>from darl import Engine def Prediction(ngn, region): model = ngn.FittedModel(region) data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() return model + data def FittedModel(ngn, region): data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() adj = {'East': 0, 'West': 1}[region] return data + 1 + adj def Data(ngn): return 1 ngn = Engine.create([Prediction, FittedModel, Data]) ngn.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 4 def FittedRandomForestModel(ngn, region): data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() return data + 99 ngn2 = ngn.update({'FittedModel': FittedRandomForestModel}) ngn2.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 101 # call to `Data` pulled from cache since not affected ngn.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 4 # Pulled from cache, not rerun ngn.trace().from_cache # -&gt; True </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Bar1754\"> /u/Global_Bar1754 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmn6rs/darl_incremental_compute_scenario_analysis/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmn6rs/darl_incremental_compute_scenario_analysis/\">[comments]</a></span>",
