      "title": "Potential of EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation to improve source analysis in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",

      "content": "<p>Google just published details about its Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), an open standard aimed at making shopping work natively with AI agents instead of websites. The idea is to standardize the entire commerce flow\u2014product discovery, pricing, checkout, payment, and post-purchase\u2014so an AI agent can complete purchases directly without custom integrations for every merchant. Merchants remain the seller of record, but expose capabilities through a common protocol, letting agents compare options and execute checkout across many stores. If this takes off, it weakens marketplace lock-in (including Amazon\u2019s) by shifting discovery and checkout out of proprietary UIs and into AI-driven intent flows, similar to how open web protocols reduced the power of early internet portals.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46586413\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46586413</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "Multimodal physiological monitoring in augmented reality teaching environments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "content": "This study investigates the integration of augmented reality (AR) teaching environments with multimodal physiological monitoring for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. We collected EEG, ECG, and eye-tracking data from 115 children (ASD n =\u202f45, ADHD n =\u202f38, SLD n =\u202f32) during AR-enhanced learning tasks. The multimodal fusion approach achieved 89.3% classification accuracy in identifying disorder-specific patterns. Key biomarkers included frontal theta power variations (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), heart rate variability indices (LF/HF ratio), and fixation duration patterns. AR environments reduced cognitive load by 27% compared to traditional settings while maintaining engagement levels. Personalized intervention based on real-time physiological feedback improved attention performance by 31.2% and social interaction scores by 24.8% over 12\u202fmonths. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of combining AR technology with physiological monitoring for adaptive special education.",

      "title": "Potential molecular pathways and therapeutic implications of rapid-acting antidepressants on myelin biology: a scoping review",
      "content": "BackgroundEmerging evidence indicates that rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs)\u2014including ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics- may affect myelin homeostasis, aside from producing fast-onset, sustained improvements in several psychiatric disorders.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Europe PMC, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and Google Scholar was conducted up to October 2025 for studies examining the effects of RAADs on myelination and oligodendrocyte biology, as well as associated molecular and cellular mechanisms.Main bodyForty-one studies met the inclusion criteria: 12 in humans, 21 in animals, 7 in vitro, and one computational/theoretical. Thirty studies investigated ketamine and 11 serotonergic RAADs. Across models, RAADs modulate myelination in a dose- and exposure-dependent manner: therapeutic doses generally promote myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte maturation, while high or repeated doses, or neonatal exposure, can disrupt myelin structure and function, impair oligodendrocyte viability, and produce cognitive, affective, and neurotoxic side effects.ConclusionMyelin regulation may represent a component of RAAD action, indicating that these agents could influence myelin biology. Further research is required to clarify the mechanisms underlying these effects, their potential implications for therapies aimed at preserving or restoring myelin integrity, and potential side effects. Their dose-dependent effects highlight the need for careful consideration of dosing and treatment duration.",
