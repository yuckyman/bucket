      "content": "<p>There are 8.2 billion humans on earth.</p>\n<p>We're extremely dynamic. You will meet people all through your life with different personalities, skills, and interests. This individual uniqueness not only makes life more interesting, but it also increases our collective ability to handle a wide range of ideas and problems.</p>\n<p>Despite these capabilities, our differences can also lead to an overwhelming feeling of division in some. Differences often lead to disagreement, anger, hostility, or violence. To say humans don't often inflict cruelty on one another would be a lie. We absolutely have shown our teeth. In innumerable ways, we've caused horror to our own species. We've dehumanized, caused suffering, and in many cases killed one another.</p>\n<p>In many ways, we're still learning. Humanity is still growing. A lot of people are trying to sort right from wrong, fair from unfair, true from untrue. This leads to a lot of confusion, a lot of chaos, and a lot of violence. To see humans go after other humans in such efficient and relentless manners is terrifying and beyond disheartening. It can be easy to lose hope, but the truth is... <em>none of it is necessary.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>None of the violence, none of the hate, none of the inequality is mandatory.</strong></em></p>\n<p>We are allowed to go against the grain of things we know are wrong. <em>We are allowed to improve our world.</em> Never be scared to do what you know is right, even when its hard, even when it might benefit someone else more than yourself. Match relentless selfishness with your own relentless generosity. Resist chaos and confusion with serenity and understanding. Engulf violence with endless harmony.</p>\n<p>Remember that truth doesn't rely on anyone. Truth doesn't ask for our opinions. Truth is eternal, unwavering, and it will always be there, waiting for us to realize what we're capable of together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em><strong>In this world there\u2019s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</strong></em> Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. <em><strong>More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.</strong></em>&quot; - Charlie Chaplin</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: <a href=\"https://redd.it/1q63cme\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://redd.it/1q63cme</a></p>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to go beyond my basic knowledge of python. So I decided code a tool which lets you copy text from any image directly to your clipboard.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong><br /> It let's you copy text from image from selection and you can copy that text directly to your clipboard.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br /> People who use OCR tools a lot for scanning text. They can use it to easily scan text from images.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> With other OCR text scanners you need to manually save the image and upload it for scan. But this tool allows you to scan text like a snipping tool.</p> <p>It is free and open-source. Currently available for Windows as &quot;.exe&quot; (GitHub repo has build instructions in case anyone wants to compile it from source).</p> <p>I will be improving it in the future making it more accurate and cross-platform.</p> <p>GitHub Repository Link (Star if you find it helpful!):<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/Nabir14/oclip\">https://github.com/Nabir14/oclip</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nabir140\"> /u/Nabir140 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5ia6n/oclip_copy_text_from_image_directly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5ia6n/oclip_copy_text_from_image_directly/\">[comments]</a></span>",
