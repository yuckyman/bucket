      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For the past 4 months, I\u2019ve been working on a full-stack project I\u2019m really proud of called <a href=\"https://pytogether.org\">PyTogether</a> (pytogether.org).</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>It is a real-time, collaborative Python IDE designed with beginners in mind (think Google Docs, but for Python). It\u2019s meant for pair programming, tutoring, or just coding Python together. It\u2019s completely free. No subscriptions, no ads, nothing. Just create an account, make a group, and start a project. Has proper code-linting, extremely intuitive UI, autosaving, drawing features (you can draw directly onto the IDE and scroll), live selections, and voice/live chats per project. There are no limitations at the moment (except for code size to prevent malicious payloads). There is also built-in support for libraries like matplotlib.</p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/SJRiz/pytogether\">https://github.com/SJRiz/pytogether</a></p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>It\u2019s designed for tutors, educators, or Python beginners.</p> <h1>Comparison With Existing Alternatives</h1> <p>Why build this when Replit or VS Code Live Share already exist?</p> <p>Because my goal was simplicity and education. I wanted something lightweight for beginners who just want to write and share simple Python scripts (alone or with others), without downloads, paywalls, or extra noise. There\u2019s also no AI/copilot built in, something many teachers and learners actually prefer. I also focused on a communication-first approach, where the IDE is the &quot;focus&quot; of communication (hence why I added tools like drawing, voice/live chats, etc).</p> <h1>Project Information</h1> <p>Tech stack (frontend):</p> <p>React + TailwindCSS</p> <p>CodeMirror for linting</p> <p>Y.js for real-time syncing and live cursors</p> <p>I use Pyodide for Python execution directly in the browser, this means you can actually use advanced libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib while staying fully client-side and sandboxed for safety.</p> <p>I don\u2019t enjoy frontend or UI design much, so I leaned on AI for some design help, but all the logic/code is mine. Deployed via Vercel.</p> <p>Tech stack (backend):</p> <p>Django (channels, auth, celery/redis support made it a great fit, though I plan to replace the celery worker with Go later so it'll be faster)</p> <p>PostgreSQL via Supabase</p> <p>JWT + OAuth authentication</p> <p>Redis for channel layers + caching</p> <p>Fully Dockerized + deployed on a VPS (8GB RAM, $7/mo deal)</p> <p>Data models:</p> <p>Users &lt;-&gt; Groups -&gt; Projects -&gt; Code</p> <p>Users can join many groups</p> <p>Groups can have multiple projects</p> <p>Each project belongs to one group and has one code file (kept simple for beginners, though I may add a file system later).</p> <p>My biggest technical challenges were around performance and browser execution. One major hurdle was getting Pyodide to work smoothly in a real-time collaborative setup. I had to run it inside a Web Worker to handle synchronous I/O (since input() is blocking), though I was able to find a library that helped me do this more efficiently (pyodide-worker-runner). This let me support live input/output and plotting in the browser without freezing the UI, while still allowing multiple users to interact with the same Python session collaboratively.</p> <p>Another big challenge was designing a reliable and efficient autosave system. I couldn\u2019t just save on every keystroke as that would hammer the database. So I designed a Redis-based caching layer that tracks active projects in memory, and a Celery worker that loops through them every minute to persist changes to the database. When all users leave a project, it saves and clears from cache. This setup also doubles as my channel layer for real-time updates and my Celery broker; reusing Redis for everything while keeping things fast and scalable.</p> <p>Deployment on a VPS was another beast. I spent ~8 hours wrangling Nginx, Certbot, Docker, and GitHub Actions to get everything up and running. It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.</p> <p>If you\u2019re curious or if you wanna see the work yourself, the source code is here.
