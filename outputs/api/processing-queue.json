      "title": "SynTEF1 restores the functional disease phenotype of SCA27B in an hiPSC-derived neuronal disease model",
      "content": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia 27B (SCA27B), caused by a deep-intronic GAA-TTC repeat expansion in FGF14, has recently been identified as one of the most frequent genetic ataxias. Yet its underlying disease mechanism remains largely unknown, and disease-modifying treatments targeting upstream disease mechanisms are lacking. Here we hypothesized that (i) SCA27B is caused by transcriptional repression of FGF14, leading to reduced neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission strength; (ii) which can be restored by a synthetic elongation transcription factor (Syn-TEF1). We assessed FGF14 mRNA levels by qPCR, and neuronal function by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in network and autaptic cultures of SCA27B patient iPSC-derived NGN2-neurons. Change in all read-outs was then assessed also upon Syn-TEF1 treatment. FGF14 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in both heterozygous and biallelic SCA27B patient-derived neurons. This was associated with decreased neuronal excitability and decreased peak current density of voltage-gated sodium channels. Moreover, SCA27B neurons showed reduced synaptic transmission with decreased excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes. Treatment with SynTEF1 restored FGF14 mRNA levels, thereby restoring neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. These insights into SCA27B pathophysiology and its amelioration by SynTEF1 open new translational avenues for the development of disease-modifying gene-targeted therapies for SCA27B.",

      "title": "A scaffold attachment factor PHM-2 regulates synaptic transmission through SLO-2 potassium channel in C. elegans",
      "content": "Scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) proteins are evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA binding proteins that are involved in multiple processes of gene expression. These proteins are broadly expressed with particular high expression observed in the nervous system. However, their physiological roles in neurons are largely unclear. Here we show that PHM-2, the sole SAFB ortholog in C. elegans, regulates synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions through an effect on SLO-2 potassium channel. We found that phm-2 knockout suppresses a sluggish phenotype of worms expressing a hyperactive SLO-2 channel, greatly reduces SLO-2-mediated neuronal whole-cell currents, and enhances neuromuscular synaptic transmission. In addition, we found that PHM-2 genetically interacts with another DNA/RNA binding protein, HRPU-2/hnRNP U, to control SLO-2 expression through a posttranscriptional mechanism. These results reveal a novel function of a SAFB protein in regulating neuronal activity, and may help understand the physiological roles of SAFB proteins in the nervous system of other species.",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "title": "A Theory of Thalamocortical Loops in Evidence Accumulation and Decision-Making",
      "content": "A prominent property of the neocortex is that it forms reciprocal excitatory loops with the thalamus. Here, we propose a function for the loops between layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons in the cortex and matrix-type relay cells in the thalamus, which is based on known anatomy and biophysics. This pathway forms an amplifier circuit with a gain less than unity in the resting condition. However, descending cortical input to apical tufts of L5 neurons can raise the gain of these neurons, boosting the thalamocortical loop into either an integrating or an amplifying regime. Multiple thalamocortical loops compete via lateral inhibition in the thalamus, resulting in a winner-take-all global dynamic among the motor commands encoded by each loop. When L5 neurons are driven by sensory inputs, the integration regime closely resembles the drift-diffusion model of decision-making. We explore basic relationships among parameters of this model and compare broadly against neurophysiological data.",
