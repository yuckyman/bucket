      "title": "Reduced belief updating impairs adaptive step initiation in older adults",
      "content": "Ageing is associated with declines in mobility and balance that threaten independence and increase the risk of falls. Although these changes are often attributed to deterioration of muscular and sensory systems, growing evidence suggests that age-related alterations in cognitive control also contribute to postural instability and gait impairments. Here, we examined whether shifts in cognitive control strategy underlie impaired gait initiation in older adults by modelling how individuals update beliefs about upcoming actions. Older and younger adults performed a choice-stepping go/no-go task in which the likelihood of initiating a step was manipulated across trials. We measured anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), the preparatory shifts in body weight that precede stepping, and modelled age-related differences in APA onset using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Older adults initiated APAs more slowly than younger adults, particularly following repeated go trials. Computational modelling revealed reduced learning rates and heightened sensitivity to uncertainty in older adults. These findings identify altered belief updating as a cognitive mechanism shaping age-related changes in adaptive stepping behaviour.",

      "content": "Astrocytes shape synapses and circuits, yet human basal ganglia astrocyte diversity is incompletely defined. We built a multimodal atlas by integrating single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and chromatin accessibility with DNA methylation, 3D chromatin conformation, and spatial transcriptomics, then mapped basal ganglia programs onto a whole-brain reference. Astrocytes segregated into three anatomical subgroups spanning striatal gray matter, extra-striatal gray matter, and white matter, with subgroup-biased neurotransmitter transporters and synapse-associated programs consistent with differences in dominant afferent input. Within striatum, dorsal and ventral astrocyte populations aligned with distinct microcircuits and were conserved in nonhuman primates. A deep learning sequence model identified subgroup-associated enhancer code and, when benchmarked against published enhancer-AAV datasets, supported the design of candidate viral tools to target basal ganglia astrocyte programs in vivo. Together, these data define major axes of human astrocyte specialization and provide a framework for cell type-specific dissection of basal ganglia function.",

      "title": "Characterization and application of hyperthermia-evoked seizures in a mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia",
      "content": "Rodent models of drug-resistant epilepsy are widely used to uncover mechanisms of seizures and to test the efficacy of treatments; however, the stochastic and relatively infrequent nature of spontaneous seizures in these models makes it challenging to observe and manipulate peri-ictal activity, and to rapidly screen therapeutics. As fever has been identified as a clinical seizure trigger, we investigated the ability of induced hyperthermia to trigger seizures in a mouse model of focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a common cause of drug-resistant epilepsy. Experimental mice were generated via in utero electroporation of a gain-of-function RHEB variant (RHEBp.P37L). In adult Rheb-FCD mice, hyperthermia elicited behavioral seizures ~80% of the time, with a mean temperature threshold of ~40 {degrees}C. Using this acute paradigm, as a proof-of-concept, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of a subset of excitatory neurons within the dysplasia significantly elevated the threshold for hyperthermia-evoked seizures. We then confirmed the relevance of this acute finding to spontaneous epileptiform activity, using repeated chemogenetic inhibition across chronic recordings to confirm a reduction of spontaneous seizures as well as interictal spikes. Overall, our data demonstrate that hyperthermia-evoked seizures can be readily elicited in Rheb-FCD mice, offering a tractable platform for evaluating therapeutic interventions targeting seizure susceptibility in focal epilepsy.",

      "title": "Dopaminergic Control of Retinal Oscillations Driving Infantile Nystagmus",
      "content": "Infantile nystagmus is a debilitating involuntary eye movement disorder often associated with retinal diseases such as Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB). The oscillating eye movements of infantile nystagmus come with reduced visual acuity, strongly impairing quality of life. No cure exists for this condition. Previously, we demonstrated that nystagmus in the CSNB mouse model Nyxnob has a retinal cause. Specifically, we found that synchronized oscillations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are transmitted to the accessory optic system, triggering compensatory eye movements. The RGC oscillations appear to originate from a specific retinal cell type, the AII amacrine cell (AII AC), making these cells the preferred target for treatment. Here we found that pharmacologically activating the dopaminergic input to AII ACs in Nyxnob mice completely suppresses the pathological oscillations of both AII ACs and RGCs and improves the signal fidelity of RGCs. Moreover, our retinal network simulations confirm that the experimentally observed changes to AII AC voltage-gated currents are sufficient to account for the dopamine-dependent abolishment of these oscillations. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic understanding of the retinal mechanism underlying infantile nystagmus as well as the associated low visual performance. Consequently, they offer the first pharmacological therapeutic strategy for this disorder.",

      "title": "Canonical cortical architecture supports the emergence of noise-invariant auditory representations",
      "content": "Neurons in the auditory system must represent behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise (BN) to support noise-invariant perception and behavior. Although primary auditory cortex (ACtx) has been implicated in constructing noise-invariant representations, it remains unclear which excitatory subpopulations within ACtx carry out this transformation from noise-dependent to noise-invariant coding. To address this, we presented pure tones with and without continuous BN to head-fixed mice and used two-photon calcium imaging to record sound-evoked activity from three major excitatory subpopulations in ACtx: layer (L)2/3 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons, L5 IT neurons, and L5 extratelencephalic (ET) neurons. L2/3 IT neurons exhibited strong noise dependence at the level of single-neuron responses, pairwise interactions, and population representations. In contrast, deep-layer pathways showed greater noise invariance, with L5 IT neurons preserving stable representations most consistently and L5 ET neurons exhibiting more limited invariance at the population level. These findings reveal a functional division of labor in ACtx, in which superficial neurons remain noise-dependent and deep-layer broadcast pathways, particularly L5 IT, preferentially carry noise-invariant representations, suggesting that excitatory subpopulations contribute differentially to the construction and propagation of noise-invariant codes.",

      "title": "Knockout of Rab27b exacerbates neuropathology in alpha-synuclein mouse models",
      "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies are characterized by the formation of inclusions comprised of alpha-synuclein (syn) among other proteins, but the mechanisms by which these inclusions form and cause toxicity are not well understood. We have previously reported that the small GTPase Rab27b modulates autophagic-lysosomal function in neurons and supports lysosomal degradation of syn across multiple syn cellular models. Knockout (KO) and knockdown of Rab27b damage lysosomal degradative capacity and exacerbate syn pathology, while Rab27b overexpression is conversely protective in cellular syn models. Elevations of Rab27b seen in human synucleinopathies suggest a compensatory role for Rab27b in these disorders. Here, we examined the role Rab27b plays in vivo in the context of both A53T genetic syn overexpression and viral AAV syn overexpression mouse models. Rab27b knockout in A53T+ mice did not alter motor behavior or survival. However, Rab27b knockout increased proteinase-K resistant syn in the cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra of A53T mice starting as early as six months of age. Additionally, Rab27b KO increased phosphorylated S129 syn in the cortex and nigra. Astrocyte and microglial activation were also observed upon Rab27b KO in the A53T model. In the AAV syn model, Rab27b KO resulted in accelerated dopaminergic cell loss in the nigra. Collectively, we report that loss of Rab27b results in elevated neuropathology in PD-relevant brain regions, validating its role as a therapeutic target in synucleinopathies.",

      "title": "Distributed disruption and remodelling of synaptome architecture following traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "A single cortical impact in mice altered the number and molecular composition of excitatory synapses across 222 brain regions. Early effects targeted synapses with rapid protein turnover, followed by changes in slow-turnover synapses. This injury-induced remodelling of synaptome architecture mirrors responses to genetic mutation, ageing, sleep deprivation and experience, suggesting that reorganisation of excitatory synapse populations is a shared mechanism underlying brain plasticity across diverse conditions.",

      "title": "Shapes of synaptic protein distributions distinguish brain architectures",
      "content": "Neuronal activity is the result of the orchestrated actions of multitudes of synapses, acting and evolving not as individuals, but as populations. We therefore collected, for millions of synapses, a functionally relevant proxy for their strengths. Namely, we measured postsynaptic protein content by deploying a fluorescent PSD95 variant. Then we summarized, by statistical moments, the shapes of the distributions of protein contents, over local synaptic populations. In this way we explored the hypothesis that such collective properties inform on brain architectures. Our measurements cover complete parasagittal sections of the mouse brain, in animals one week to 18 months old. We identified a hierarchical organization of regions along the anterior-posterior axis, with three main clusters of divergent synaptic population shapes. One includes telencephalic regions, one is centered in the midbrain and hindbrain, and one comprises mainly the thalamus and the cerebellum. The structure emerging from our approach aligns with discoveries in studies of regional patterns of cellular gene expressions. Our results suggest that synaptic populations are dynamically regulated over the lifespan. Regions which at three months of age have thinner tails largely conserve their distribution shapes later in life, whereas heavy tails in other regions strikingly grow ever more so.",

      "title": "Lysosomal escape and TMEM106B fibrillar core determine TDP-43 seeding outcomes",
      "content": "Frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) shows striking clinical and neuropathological heterogeneity, yet a systematic analysis of subtype-specific features and inter-patient variability was missing. We treated human neurons and neuron-like cells with 30 postmortem brain samples and quantified neoaggregate formation, loss of function and changes in the TDP-43 interactome to define determinants of seeding outcomes. Potent FTLD-TDP-A seeds drove a progressive collapse of physiological TDP-43 interactions accompanied by functional loss. Beyond the burden of pathological TDP-43, we identified the fibrillar core of the lysosomal protein TMEM106B as a critical pro-seeding factor. Transient lysosomal injury markedly enhanced neoaggregation and loss of function, likely by promoting fibril interactions with native TDP-43. Our work establishes a mechanistic link between TMEM106B and TDP-43 aggregation, identifies lysosomal escape as a key driver of pathology and introduces the strongest model yet for seeded TDP-43 aggregation and loss of function, to enable discovery of disease modifiers.",
