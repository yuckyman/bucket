      "title": "An auditory \"low road\" for threat in humans sensitive to fast temporal cues",
      "content": "Rapid threat processing is crucial for survival. In vision, neural models of emotion propose the existence of direct pathways, or \"low roads\", from visual thalamus to the amygdala, which may rely on magnocellular inputs and thereby enable rapid processing of threat signals. In audition, evidence from non-human animals points to the existence of a similar fast direct pathway, but its presence in humans remains unknown. Building on animal evidence that high-rate amplitude-modulated (highAM) sounds preferentially engage magnocellular processing, we used behavioral, physiological, and neuroimaging measures to search for an auditory \"low road\" for threat in humans responsive to magnocellular-associated features. Specifically, we tested whether highAM threat cues elicit rapid affective responses, and whether highAM threat processing aligns with structural thalamo-amygdala connectivity. We recorded electroencephalography and pupillometry from participants while they detected voices during fear conditioning. Emotional voices presented at highAM rates, as opposed to lowAM, elicited threat-related responses during the earliest post-stimulus window. A further study combining functional and diffusion-weighted imaging revealed that selective amygdala responses to highAM threatening voices were functionally associated with individual fiber density of an auditory thalamo-amygdala pathway. These results provide convergent functional and anatomical evidence supporting a subcortical pathway for auditory threat processing, consistent with evolutionarily conserved emotional systems.",

      "title": "Conditional-longitudinal brain growth charts detect MRI changes with birth weight and psychopathology",
      "content": "Key Points: Question: How do differences in brain maturation trajectories, quantified by novel conditional-longitudinal models, relate to perinatal factors and mental health in adolescence? Findings: In this longitudinal analysis of neuroimaging data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, conditional-longitudinal normative models revealed that trajectories of brain maturation in adolescence are associated with birth weight, and with longitudinal changes in mental health. Meaning: Conditional-longitudinal models detect inter-individual variability in brain maturation, which is related to both perinatal factors and concurrent changes in psychopathology. Importance: Brain maturation varies between individuals, particularly during dynamic developmental periods like adolescence. Directly assessing differences in longitudinal trajectories can reveal deviations from normative patterns. Objective: We present novel conditional-longitudinal normative models that characterize variability in brain maturation. We utilize these models to examine whether differences in longitudinal trajectories are associated with birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), and longitudinal psychopathology scores derived from behavioral assessments. Design: Cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal normative models were developed for brain volumes derived from the first two neuroimaging timepoints from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. Conditional-longitudinal models index an individual's expected brain volume at follow-up, conditioned on their baseline measurement. Models were fit with split-half cross-validation on demographically matched samples. Setting: The ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site, population-based, longitudinal cohort study. Participants: Participants were excluded based on imaging quality flags and missing data, leaving 10,830 at baseline and 7,262 at follow-up. Exposures: BW and GA were derived from parent-report questionnaires. General psychopathology scores were calculated using a bifactor model. Main Outcomes and Measures: We calculated cross-sectional and conditional-longitudinal centiles, respectively quantifying individual deviations in size and change between timepoints. Sensitivity analyses included covariates for parental income and education as well as current weight and height. Results: The sample was 10,830 at baseline (48.2% F, age 9-10y) and 7,262 at follow-up (46.6% F, age 11-13y). Conditional-longitudinal centiles were sensitive to individual differences in brain change between timepoints. Lower BW was associated with lower conditional-longitudinal centiles, suggesting larger decreases in brain volumes over time (27 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.08). Lower conditional-longitudinal centiles were associated with greater increases in psychopathology scores, suggesting with increased psychopathology brain volumes show greater decrease (37 regions pfdr<0.05, {beta}max=0.06). Notably, changes in psychopathology were not related to brain size at either timepoint, indexed by cross-sectional centiles. Conclusions and Relevance: Models that capture individual-level deviations from expected growth trajectories, rather than static positions on a growth curve, are particularly informative for assessing developmental change. Novel conditional-longitudinal models address this gap in lifespan brain imaging. Using this framework, we demonstrate robust associations between individual trajectory deviations, perinatal adversity, and longitudinally assessed mental health symptoms. Conditional-longitudinal models hold promise for applications across psychiatric neuroscience, from development to aging.",

      "title": "Inferotemporal cortex encodes formation and termination of perceptual decisions",
      "content": "Visually guided behavior requires transforming sensory inputs into decisions based on behavioral goals. Inferotemporal cortex (IT) is traditionally seen as a perceptual stage that provides object representations for downstream decision circuits. Here, we show that neurons in anterior IT (area TEa) reflect core elements of decision formation. Using a face categorization task with stochastic visual features, we disentangled momentary evidence, accumulated evidence, and choice commitment in the same neural population. TEa neurons integrated task-relevant features over time, suppressed responses after commitment, and dynamically filtered relevant from irrelevant inputs. These are hallmarks of bounded evidence accumulation, typically attributed to frontoparietal regions. Unlike frontoparietal regions, TEa encoded the decision variable in a novel format -as a running average- enabling signal-to-noise ratio improvements without ramping. These findings challenge the view of IT as a passive perceptual buffer, positioning TEa as a decision-aware hub that transforms visual inputs to support flexible, goal-directed behavior.",

      "title": "Rhythmicity Revisited: Evidence from Robust Behavioral Oscillations",
      "content": "Rhythmic fluctuations in neuronal excitability, called neural oscillations, pervade brain activity. If these oscillations have a functional role in behavior, they should also be expressed in a behavioral signature. However, identifying such a behavioral signature has remained controversial: evidence for behavioral oscillations is not yet firmly established, and aperiodic components can be misidentified as rhythmic. To test their existence while controlling for aperiodic dynamics, we applied a state-of-the-art autoregressive (AR) approach on two datasets: one published dataset, and a new dataset collected with a revised dense-sampling design. In both datasets, AR modeling recovered reliable behavioral oscillations in the theta band. Reanalyses of the published dataset also reproduced the reported theta shift with task demands, with more difficult tasks showing slower theta. In contrast, despite clear rhythmicity, the new dataset showed no consistent frequency shift across conditions. Overall, this study establishes rigorous and robust detection of behavioral oscillations. It also suggests that the frequency modulation of behavioral oscillations by task difficulty requires further study.",

      "title": "Optimal parameters for measuring multiband auditory brainstem responses to continuous speech",
      "content": "Accurate clinical hearing assessment depends on efficient, engaging measures designed to evaluate ecologically relevant stimuli. Often brief tones or narrowband noise stimuli are used, providing a useful but limited snapshot of hearing function. Including dynamic speech offers a means to capture how the hearing system encodes complex sounds critical for everyday communication. Here we describe the optimal parameters for using audiobook continuous speech with the multiband peaky speech paradigm to measure frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) to standard audiological octave bands from 500-8000 Hz in each ear simultaneously. Using computational modeling and direct human ABR testing in adults with normal hearing, we demonstrate that continuous speech signals with a chirp phase profile and fundamental frequency (f0) lowered to the range of 90-110 Hz evoke the largest ABR wave V amplitudes. This amplitude boost occurs when any narrator's f0 is lowered to this optimal range, but the largest responses occur for narrators with original f0s below 170 Hz. We also confirmed that different narrator speech stimuli with these optimized parameters can evoke similarly sized ABRs, but some minor differences remain for testing time. Ultimately, optimizing phase-f0 parameters substantially sped up the median testing time to obtain robust audiobook-based multiband ABRs to within 14 minutes, thereby making this paradigm more feasible for future research and clinical translation.",

      "content": "Mitochondria and nucleotide metabolism are critical for cellular and developmental homeostasis, yet their potential interdependence and role in neurodevelopmental disease remain unclear. In MECP2 Duplication Syndrome (MDS), we identify a conserved correlation between mitochondrial function and purine metabolism that is disrupted across human, organoid, and mouse models. Multiomics integration reveals Complex III as the focal point of mitochondrial collapse, leading to redox stress, DNA damage, and hyperactivation of the de novo purine biosynthesis via purinosome assembly. The breakdown of mitochondria-purinosome coupling compromises genome stability, impairs radial glia proliferation, and delays neuronal maturation. By linking a defined genetic dosage imbalance to metabolic network failure, our study positions the mitochondria-purinosome coordination as a fundamental control axis for neurodevelopment and a therapeutic entry point across metabolic and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "content": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact quantum sensors that can measure the magnetic fields generated by muscle activity (magnetomyography, MMG) without skin contact. This contact-free alternative to surface electromyography (EMG) has remained mostly confined to magnetically shielded rooms and simple tasks, limiting translation. Here, we show that a portable OPM-MMG system operated inside a compact magnetic shield can robustly decode fine finger movements and recover EMG-like muscle activation patterns. Eight participants executed flexion- extension combinations spanning 15 finger actions while we recorded triaxial MMG and bipolar EMG concurrently. MMG supported robust multi-class and finger-specific decoding, recovering a representational geometry that closely matched EMG. Orientation analyses showed that components orthogonal to the muscle axis contributed most significantly to discriminability, providing actionable guidance for OPM array design. Our results show that OPM-MMG in a portable shielded environment preserves task-relevant neuromuscular information and approaches EMG-level structure without skin contact or a magnetically shielded room. Our findings open a path toward hygienic, rapid-setup assessment and human-machine interfacing in clinics and rehabilitation settings.",

      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "content": "A prominent property of the neocortex is that it forms reciprocal excitatory loops with the thalamus. Here, we propose a function for the loops between layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons in the cortex and matrix-type relay cells in the thalamus, which is based on known anatomy and biophysics. This pathway forms an amplifier circuit with a gain less than unity in the resting condition. However, descending cortical input to apical tufts of L5 neurons can raise the gain of these neurons, boosting the thalamocortical loop into either an integrating or an amplifying regime. Multiple thalamocortical loops compete via lateral inhibition in the thalamus, resulting in a winner-take-all global dynamic among the motor commands encoded by each loop. When L5 neurons are driven by sensory inputs, the integration regime closely resembles the drift-diffusion model of decision-making. We explore basic relationships among parameters of this model and compare broadly against neurophysiological data.",
