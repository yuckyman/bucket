      "title": "Substantia nigra pars reticulata regulates prefrontal cortex via ventromedial thalamus",
      "content": "The ventromedial thalamus (VM) innervates layer 1 (L1) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to influence executive function and arousal. Thalamocortical (TC) cells in VM process inputs from cortex that are important for generating persistent activity in closed reciprocal loops. However, little is known about connectivity and influence of subcortical inputs to TC cells, and how they are routed through VM to circuits in the mPFC. Here we use anatomical tracing, electrophysiology, and optogenetics to investigate subcortico-thalamo-cortical circuits in mouse VM. We first characterize the morphology and physiology of TC cells in VM and determine their main subcortical input arises from substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). We then show how SNr inputs make strong inhibitory connections onto TC cells, which are mediated by GABAA receptors and effectively suppress action potential firing. Lastly, we utilize intersectional approaches to show how SNr inputs are channeled via TC cells in VM to engage specific inhibitory networks in L1 of mPFC. Together, our results indicate how subcortical inputs engage higher-order thalamus to influence the frontal cortex, highlighting differences from equivalent circuits in motor systems.",

      "title": "KCC2 Activation Reverses Neurophysiological and Behavioral Deficits in Female Rett Mice",
      "content": "Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from mutations in the MeCP2 gene, leading to intellectual disability, impaired motor coordination, decreased sociability, and seizures. Central to the underlying pathophysiology are deficits in synaptic inhibition, which are mediated by hyperpolarizing GABAAR currents. These events develop postnatally and are dependent upon increased neuronal Cl- extrusion mediated by SLC12A5 (KCC2). Therefore, we tested whether its activation modifies the disease phenotypes evident in female MeCP2+/- mice, using OV350, a direct activator of KCC2. OV350 rapidly induced a sustained reduction in EEG power, accompanied by a decrease in the severity of epileptic discharges. Increased motor coordination, sociability, and spatial memory were also observed. Deficits in KCC2 phosphorylation were also seen in MeCP2+/- mice, consistent with reductions in its activity that were also ameliorated by OV350. Thus, KCC2 activation may be efficacious in limiting the impact of Rett syndrome and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Striatal Acetylcholine Dip-Rebound Is Induced by Direct Pathway Neurons and Encodes Action-Outcome Contingency",
      "content": "Learning contingencies between actions and outcomes is pivotal in adaptive behavior and requires ongoing flexible sensory, motor, and reward information integration. The striatum is central to the integration. However, it remains unclear how the striatal neurons interact with each other to facilitate learning. Here we show that in the dorsomedial striatum, direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs), but not dopamine (DA), inhibit cholinergic interneurons, inducing a characteristic acetylcholine (ACh) dip-rebound, encoding action-outcome (A-O) contingency. Using genetically encoded sensors and in vivo fiber photometry, we find that dMSN activation, ACh dip-rebound, and DA transients emerge only after mice acquire the contingency. dMSN activity and ACh dynamics persist even when rewards are probabilistic, adapt in time as the learned relationship between action and reward evolves, and vanish when the contingency is degraded. Ex vivo recordings and in vivo optogenetics further show that dMSN activity is both sufficient and required to generate the ACh dip-rebound through GABAergic inhibition of cholinergic interneurons. Disrupting the dip-rebound slows acquisition and accelerates extinction. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized dMSN-ACh circuit mechanism that encodes contingency during instrumental learning, operating alongside DA signals that track reward outcomes.",

      "title": "Autism associated mutation in Cacna1d causes perseverative behavioral phenotype in mice",
      "content": "Behavioral inflexibility and perseveration are core features of autism spectrum disorder and are frequently modeled in mice using reversal learning and repetitive behavior assays. Mutations in CACNA1D, which encodes the L-type calcium channel Cav1.3, have been linked to autism, yet their behavioral consequences remain incompletely characterized. We examined mice carrying the autism-associated Cacna1dG407R gain-of-function mutation across a battery of assays assessing learning, flexibility, and repetitive behavior. Mutant mice learned spatial discriminations and instrumental contingencies at rates comparable to wild-type controls but exhibited deficits during reversal learning following intermediate and extended overtraining, as well as under probabilistic reinforcement. Across ethological assays, mutant mice showed increased grooming, marble burying, and nestlet shredding, consistent with enhanced perseverative behavior. Anxiety-related measures and general locomotion were largely unaffected. These results identify Cav1.3 gain-of-function as a selective regulator of behavioral flexibility and support a role for calcium-dependent corticostriatal plasticity in autism-associated perseveration.",

      "title": "Predictive coding narrows the gap between convolutional networks and human brain function in misspelled-word reading",
      "content": "Humans can readily recognize words even when they are misspelled, though with slower responses, demonstrating remarkable robustness in reading. The computational mechanisms underlying this combination of robustness and cost in reading remain unclear. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to model primate visual and human word processing. However, standard CNNs lack recurrent and feedback connections abundant in the ventral visual stream, which are thought to support robust vision. Here, we incorporated brain-inspired predictive coding dynamics into a CNN to investigate whether predictive coding can enhance brain-likeness in misspelled-word reading. The CNN backbone was trained to classify images of a 1000-word Finnish vocabulary (supervised), and the predictive coding modules were trained to reconstruct the activity in the previous layer (unsupervised). The model, with and without the predictive coding dynamics, was then evaluated using the same real and misspelled word stimuli presented to human participants during a magnetoencephalography (MEG) recording. Predictive coding improved model performance on misspelled words, particularly reducing the accuracy gap between real and word-like misspelled words, mirroring human behavioral patterns. Furthermore, representational similarity and ridge regression analyses showed stronger correspondence between model activations and human MEG responses. These findings provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that predictive coding dynamics narrows the gap between CNN performance and human brain function in misspelled-word reading, offering a biologically plausible computational mechanism for the brain's robust reading ability.",

      "title": "Dynamic engagement of the motor cortex in controlling movement",
      "content": "Neural circuits do not contribute equally or continuously to behavior. In mice, the motor cortex can be essential or dispensable for movement in different contexts, but how it is dynamically recruited as behavioral demands evolve remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that motor cortical involvement in movement exhibits rapid, discrete state transitions even during movements that otherwise appear continuous. While robust and reproducible across animals, the timing and presence of these state transitions are highly sensitive to task structure. We find that motor cortical engagement is sustained under conditions of sensorimotor uncertainty and dissipates rapidly when sensorimotor contingencies are resolved and actions and outcomes thus become predictable. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized layer of fast-timescale flexibility in the neural control of movement and offer a conceptual framework for understanding how cortical circuits dynamically govern behavior as demands evolve.",

      "title": "Mapping memory-guided saccade population receptive fields reveals principles of cortical organization along the human intraparietal sulcus",
      "content": "The intraparietal sulcus is a central hub for motor planning and sensorimotor integration. Its responses are known to support coordinate transformations across reference frames and modalities for example, eye position gain fields that convert retinotopic, fovea centred signals into head centred representations. In the oculomotor domain, the human intraparietal sulcus is sensitive to eye movement planning and has been extensively studied using memory-guided saccade paradigms. These classic approaches have revealed topographic organization and contralateral sensitivity for preferred direction in saccade planning and execution. However, such designs provide detailed information about preferred direction; they do not probe tuning width: how narrowly or broadly a given cortical location responds around its preferred direction. At present, it remains unclear whether and how tuning width is organized along the human intraparietal sulcus. Critically, neurophysiological studies in non human primates do not offer systematic and extensive measurements of tuning width. Moreover, the relationship between tuning width and preferred direction at the population level in human intraparietal cortex is unknown. Here, we address these questions using a forward modelling approach combined with high field (7 Tesla) functional MRI. We observe contralateral preference for preferred direction in saccade planning and execution, as well as a novel large scale organization of preferred saccade tuning width, in vivo, in humans.",

To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",
