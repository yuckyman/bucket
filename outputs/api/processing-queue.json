      "title": "White-Matter BOLD Mediates Time-Varying Cortico-Cortical Functional Connectivity",
      "content": "Functional connectivity (FC) measurements in the brain using BOLD fMRI have largely focused on correlations between gray-matter (GM) BOLD signals, ignoring the possible relevance of white-matter (WM) in delineating neural networks. We first employed a tract-informed mediation framework to test whether WM pathways contribute indirect, bundle-specific effects to cortico-cortical coupling. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we quantified pathway-level mediation effects across GM-WM-GM units and found that WM BOLD signals significantly mediated GM-GM associations, with clear tract-dependent heterogeneity. Building upon this, we examined how dynamic features of WM BOLD signals relate to time-varying intra-cortical FC. We found that temporal variability of WM signals, rather than their mean amplitudes, more closely tracked fluctuations in GM-GM dynamic connectivity, with correlations reaching approximately 0.4 across specific tracts. Together, these results indicate that WM BOLD signals are related to how cortical regions interact, underscoring their integral role in large-scale brain network organization.",

      "title": "Master clock-thalamic-prefrontal circuit controls circadian social priority",
      "content": "Social behaviors arise from complex brain operations that adapt to intricate targets and varying states. Achieving a singular social goal requires an extensive social brain network, of which computation is malleable and subject to modulation by diverse internal factors. However, how the brain leverages its internal state to navigate competing social goals is elusive. Here we show that the priority between competing instincts-social novelty versus sexual preference-exhibits a distinct circadian pattern. This is controlled by a two-component circuit linking the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key brain region in the social brain network. Specifically, SCNVIP neurons project to Vipr2-expressing neurons within the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE), which in turn projects to the mPFC to mediate this behavior. The function of Vipr2 in the RE is critical for shaping the circadian pattern of both appetitive and consummatory social behaviors. This allows higher social functions to be engaged in a timely manner, appropriately aligning prioritized social behaviors with the body's clock-regulated reproductive system. Overall, this SCN-RE-mPFC circuit provides a neural principle through which the master clock coordinates the prefrontal cortex to resolve a conflict of motivated behaviors by referencing an internal state.",

      "title": "Modeling the Action-Perception Loop and its role in Phantom Limb Pain using Active Inference",
      "content": "Phantom limb pain is among the most prevalent and distressing consequences of limb amputation. Theories regarding its underlying mechanisms remain disputed, contributing to challenges in effectively treating the pain. In recent years, mathematical models grounded in the Bayesian inference framework have been used to describe various aspects of pain perception. However, pain is not only passively inferred but actively shaped through interactions with the environment--a dimension that classical Bayesian approaches typically do not capture. Because amputation disrupts both sensory input related to the limb and the ability to perform actions, a model incorporating both sensory and active components of pain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain. To this end, we developed a model within the active inference framework, which extends Bayesian inference to include action selection. The model provides a conceptual account of how loss of limb control, ambiguity in sensory input pertaining to limb position, residual noxious input, and preamputation pain may contribute to the emergence and persistence of phantom limb pain. Furthermore, it offers insight into the possible mechanisms underlying common interventions and may help account for their variable efficacy across individuals.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Behavioral orienting but not novelty activates dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Novel stimuli have a profound impact on brain function and behavior. They evoke attention, arousal and sensory exploration and induce synaptic plasticity in brain regions related to learning and memory. Many of these effects have been attributed to novelty-evoked activation of the dopaminergic midbrain and dopamine (DA) release in major projection targets in the striatum. However, it remains controversial if individual DA neurons respond to novel stimuli. To address this question, we recorded and manipulated DA neurons in mice exposed to novel and familiar odors while monitoring orienting behaviors including exploratory sniffing, facial movements, and pupil dilation. We found that DA neurons were activated by orienting behaviors, rather than by novelty itself. Moreover, their activity was causally involved in generating the orienting responses. Finally, we identified a major input region to the dopaminergic midbrain which couples orienting to DA firing. Activity in the mediodorsal pons (mdPons) correlated tightly with sniffing and facial movements. Consequently, optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic mdPons neurons induced both orienting and DA firing. Our findings suggest that DA neurons do not respond to novelty per se but are activated through descending glutamatergic projections from the mdPons. This mechanism links salient sensory events to DA release, providing a basis for novelty-evoked exploration and plasticity.",

      "title": "P2CSL: cross-subject EEG classification by subspace class prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling",
      "content": "Objective. Domain adaptation (DA) has achieved remarkable performance in cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding by mitigating the inter-subject data distribution discrepancies. However, when exploring the feature alignment subspace and performing self-supervised pseudo-labeling in an iterative way, two difficulties are often encountered: one is that unreliable target labeling results inevitably mislead the domain-free feature learning process in the early stage and the other is that the contribution of source and target samples should be balanced in the later stage. Approach. To address both issues, this paper proposes prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling (P2CSL) method to use subspace class prototypes to assist in labeling target samples under the unified framework of domain-invariant EEG feature learning and the self-supervised target sample labeling, and progressively incorporate confident target samples into DA model fitting. The underlying rationality is that early-stage pseudo-labels from unconverged models are prone to error propagation, requiring auxiliary mechanisms to ensure their reliability and stabilize training. With the gradual alignment of cross-subject features, the estimated pseudo-label information of target domain will be more reliable, meaning that more target samples should be involved in model training. Main results. Experiments on emotion recognition and inner speech decoding demonstrate the competitive performance of P2CSL in cross-subject EEG classification in comparison with SOTA methods. Significance. Our study indicates the effectiveness of jointly considering the reliability of target samples and their contribution to model training in the context of DA. In addition, some fine-grained results including the sample confidence allocation strategy, the DA effects, and the dynamic model optimization process are provided to further illustrate the model execution details.",
