      "title": "Lightweight deep learning models for EEG decoding: a review",
      "content": "Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices by decoding electroencephalography (EEG)signals into actionable commands. As a noninvasive and portable modality, EEG-based BCIs hold promise for applications ranging from neurorehabilitation to assistive technologies. However, their performance depends critically on the accurate extraction of relevant neural features and the reliable recognition of underlying patterns. Deep learning has transformed this process. By automatically learning complex, task-relevant representations from raw or minimally processed EEG data, deep neural networks have surpassed many traditional handcrafted feature approaches in both accuracy and adaptability. Yet, the substantial computational and memory demands of many deep learning architectures limit their deployment in portable or real-time BCI systems. This challenge has motivated a growing interest in lightweight models-architectures optimized to reduce complexity while preserving or even enhancing performance. This paper provides a systematic review of such lightweight deep learning models for EEG signal classification. To organize this landscape, existing approaches are categorized into three main strategies: (1) information integration strategies based on multi-scale feature fusion, (2) hidden layer optimization strategies, and (3) hybrid improvement strategies based on structural optimization. The review synthesizes recent advances, identifies emerging trends, and outlines potential directions for future research. These insights aim to inform the design of efficient and robust EEG classification architectures capable of meeting the practical demands of real-world BCI applications.",

      "title": "Evaluating the clinical readiness of artificial intelligence in EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis",
      "content": "Objective. Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based epilepsy diagnosis has reported near-perfect accuracies for almost two decades on a benchmark dataset, yet virtually no system is used in routine care. We critically re-examined this translation gap by reproducing five widely cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) models spanning statistical feature extraction, classical machine-learning and deep-learning paradigms, and assessed their ability to generalise from the benchmark dataset to a newly curated, clinically verified scalp-EEG cohort. Approach. All models were implemented as originally described and trained with ten-fold cross-validation on the benchmark dataset. External validation was performed on our independently curated dataset made publicly available, comprising 30 subjects (15 epilepsy, 15 healthy) recorded with 19-channel scalp EEG under standard clinical protocols. We further examined the influence of subject-level data leakage by contrasting performance when training/testing samples overlapped with those when completely independent patient partitions were enforced. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of ROC (with 95% Confidence Intervals) were the primary metrics. Main results. When transferred unchanged to the external cohort, overall accuracy fell from 94% on the benchmark dataset to 42%\u201353%, with sensitivities as low as 0.97% for the deep convolutional neural network and specificities dropping to 4% for time-frequency methods. Permitting subject overlap artificially elevated accuracy to 59%\u201396%, whereas strict patient separation reduced it to 41%\u201353% in 95% Confidence Interval. Deep-learning models exhibited the steepest decline, confirming over-fitting to subject-specific artefacts. Statistical feature\u2013based approaches, though less affected, still under-performed clinically acceptable thresholds. Significance. Our results expose key translational barriers in AI for EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis\u2013data leakage, acquisition bias, and overfitting to patient idiosyncrasies\u2013leading to severe performance erosion on clinical data. Rigorous patient-independent validation, transparent reporting (aligned with CARE principles), and well-curated multi-channel scalp-EEG datasets are essential to ensure clinically dependable AI tools for epilepsy diagnosis.",

      "title": "Physiological Arousal as a Predominant Source of Individual Differences in Functional Brain Networks",
      "content": "Individual differences in brain network function and organization are promising targets for fMRI-based biomarkers in precision psychiatry, yet the sources of individual variability remain poorly understood. We show that arousal, assessed by systemic low-frequency oscillation (sLFO) amplitude in the fMRI signal, accounts for a substantial portion of variance in brain network properties (e.g.: R= 0.70 for default mode network (DMN)-dorsal attention connectivity; R= -0.63 for DMN dynamics). These relationships replicated across sessions, across independent samples, and when assessed with traditional arousal indices. Critically, associations persisted after sLFO denoising, indicating a genuine brain-physiology relationship rather than hemodynamic artifact. Pharmacological manipulation showed that drug-induced sLFO-assessed arousal changes were accompanied by corresponding shifts in network connectivity and dynamics. This work identifies arousal as a prominent determinant of variability in functional brain networks, providing a new perspective on brain-based individual differences while offering an approach to measure arousal directly from fMRI data.",

      "title": "Distinct neural temporal architectures encode rapid social expressions and sustained internal mood states",
      "content": "Affective processing operates across multiple temporal scales, from rapid social signaling through facial expressions to sustained internal mood states, yet the neural computational principles governing these different timescales remain unclear. Understanding how the brain implements distinct temporal architectures for momentary versus persistent affective phenomena is important to comprehending emotional processing and developing objective biomarkers for psychiatric conditions. Here, we introduced a multimodal approach combining automated facial expression monitoring and continuous intracranial electroencephalography in 2,037 electrode contacts across 16 epilepsy patients, over multiple days. Of these, 15 and 12 patients met criteria for facial expression and for mood analysis, respectively. Among patients meeting criteria, we captured 1,396 naturalistic smiles, and 3,746 neutral expressions, separated by at least 10 seconds, alongside 336 periodic mood assessments. This paradigm revealed distinct behavioral and neural computational architectures. Aperiodic neural activity in the lateral temporal cortex (79.5% accuracy) encoded facial expressions with high cross-participant generalizability. Mood states, however, showed different encoding patterns. Facial expressions provided no consistent mood indicators across participants. Critically, low-gamma power dynamics in limbic regions encoded mood states in only a subset of individuals (5 of 12 participants) with expression-mood behavioral correlations, suggesting a distinct encoding phenotype. Cross-domain analysis confirmed computational independence: neural features optimized for facial expression decoding failed to predict sustained mood states, and vice versa. These findings suggest that multiple neural mechanisms may influence underlying affective processing, with variations in their contributions between individuals. The results provide a framework for understanding individual differences in neural mood representation and establish methodological approaches for objective measurement of naturalistic affective behaviors.",

      "title": "Single-cell perturbations reveal adaptive, stimulus-dependent recurrence in visual cortex",
      "content": "Cortical processing must adapt dynamically to the strength of sensory inputs, integrating information when signals are weak and refining representations when they are strong. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest this adaptation involves recurrent cortical circuits through cooperative amplification and competitive interactions within functional networks. Recent studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) have begun to support this idea, consistent with novel circuit motifs whereby excitatory and inhibitory cells are strongly connected. Despite these advancements, neither models or data provide a clear picture of the behavior of cortical columns within circuits with functional topography. Here, neighboring cells (excitatory and inhibitory) are selective for similar features in visual space, raising the question as to whether cortical columns act as amplifiers or engage in feature competition. Moreover, columnar network models make a strong prediction: cortical circuits should engage in functional amplification during weak sensory drive, transitioning to suppressive interactions with increasing sensory drive-a prediction not yet directly tested. Using single-cell perturbations in ferret V1, we show that cortical networks switch between amplification and suppression, depending on stimulus strength. Combining two-photon optogenetic stimulation with a generalized linear model (GLM) to quantify perturbations, we uncovered spatially broad suppressive influence modulated by stimulus contrast. At low contrast, we observed amplification between functionally-coupled cells. At high contrast, these networks switched to suppression. This reversal emerged in a recurrent network model with strong inhibitory-excitatory connectivity and weaker excitatory-excitatory connections. This class of models predicts markedly stronger suppressive influences from inhibitory cells onto excitatory populations, which we confirmed with cell-specific perturbations. Our results show that cortical recurrence with functional topography toggles between amplification and suppression, providing direct evidence long-predicted by normative and mechanistic circuit models of visual cortex.",

      "title": "Musical training improves planning and robustness of sequence learning",
      "content": "Musicians demonstrate advantages in acquiring motor sequences, showing faster learning and better explicit sequence knowledge than non-musicians. However, it is unclear whether this advantage extends beyond acquisition to the consolidation phase, which is when newly learned skills stabilize and become resistant to interference. Additionally, while interference from executing competing motor tasks is well-established, less is known about whether purely sensory information presented after learning can disrupt consolidation of a bimodal motor sequence. We investigated how post-acquisition sensory interference affects performance of a learned audio-visual sequence, and whether musical training moderates this vulnerability. Participants first learned an explicit sequence in a serial reaction time task using synchronous, informative audio-visual cues. After a brief consolidation period, they were randomly assigned to one of four observational conditions that manipulated the relationship between auditory and visual streams. Motor performance was then reassessed. Post-acquisition sensory interference significantly impaired subsequent motor performance, but this effect was modality-specific: it was driven primarily by manipulations to the task-relevant visual stream, while auditory interference alone had no credible effect. Distributional analysis revealed that learning involved a strategic shift from reactive to anticipatory responding. Critically, participants with musical training made this shift significantly faster than those without, demonstrating a more rapid adoption of predictive motor control. These findings demonstrate that newly formed sensorimotor memories are selectively vulnerable to interference in task-relevant modalities. Furthermore, our work provides a mechanistic explanation for the musician advantage in sequence learning, linking it to faster development of predictive motor strategies during consolidation.",
