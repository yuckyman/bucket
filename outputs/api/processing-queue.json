      "title": "Impaired development of the medial olivocochlear system in a KCNQ4-deficient mouse model.",
      "content": "The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system modulates outer hair cell (OHC) excitability and protects cochlea from overstimulation. Cholinergic activation of alpha9alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) triggers Ca+2 influx, activating BK and SK2 Ca+2-dependent K+; channels, and K+ extrusion through KCNQ4 to restore membrane potential. KCNQ4-loss causes chronic depolarization, OHC dysfunction, and hearing loss. Here, we investigated how KCNQ4 deficiency affects cochlear efferent synapse development and organization. Using confocal immunofluorescence, we analyzed efferent innervation in the organ of Corti of Kcnq4-/- (KO) and Kcnq4+/+ (WT) mice at 2, 3, 4, and 10 postnatal weeks (W). At 2 W, efferent terminals were similarly distributed between basal and lateral OHC membrane domains in both genotypes. During maturation, WT mice exhibited complete relocation of MOC terminals to the basal domain, whereas KO mice showed delayed maturation, with some terminals laterally displaced up to 10 W. KCNQ4 absence was associated with reduced number and volume of efferent boutons on OHCs. Milder morphometric alterations were observed in efferent boutons within the inner hair cell region. At the molecular level, qPCR revealed downregulation of alpha10 nAChR subunit, BK, and SK2 transcripts in KO at 4 W, with recovery to 10 W. Despite this recovery, BK protein showed reduced expression, mislocalization, and disorganized synaptic plaques in OHCs. KO also displayed age-dependent upregulation of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and calretinin, suggesting compensatory responses to altered Ca+2 homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate that KCNQ4 is essential for OHC repolarization, maturation and maintenance of cochlear efferent synapses.",

      "title": "Beyond the Focus of Expansion: Retinal curl as a functional signal for heading estimation",
      "content": "Prevailing models aiming at explaining heading assume that humans need to recover the Focus of Expansion (FOE) while filtering out rotational flow (curl) caused by eye movements. We propose an alternative: the visual system utilizes retinal curl directly to estimate heading, rendering the explicit recovery of the FOE unnecessary. Stationary participants viewed simulated walking paths on a large screen while fixating on ground targets at varying eccentricities -a natural behavior inducing sustained retinal curl. Participants continuously reported perceived heading. To isolate the role of rotational flow, we employed a real-time manipulation that kept translational flow constant while the foveal curl component was either intact, cancelled, or overcancelled. Under natural conditions, participants exhibited systematic heading biases opposite the direction of gaze. Crucially, these biases vanished in the 'cancelled curl' condition, identifying retinal curl as the specific driver of perceptual bias. We modeled these results using a simple feedback controller and a ring-attractor neural network featuring gaze-contingent inhibition and a 'straight-ahead' prior. These findings suggest the brain exploits the geometry of gaze stabilization to simplify navigation, treating retinal curl as a functional signal rather than noise to be filtered.",

      "title": "The loss of Tau in the adult brain triggers neuroplastic, epigenetic and behavioral deficits",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION: Accumulation of pathological Tau precipitates neuronal malfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the impact of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain, independently of Tau aggregates, remains unclarified. METHODS: We used a mouse model with conditional mapt knocking-down in forebrain of 5-7 months old animals (cTau-KO), a virus-driven selective Tau knockdown in wild-types (WT) and Tau re-expression approaches, accompanied by neurostructural, epigenetic, proteomic, electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral analyses. RESULTS: Loss of Tau in the adult brain of cTau-KOs triggers neuronal atrophy and malfunction, epigenetic as well cognitive and mood deficits. Importantly, these perturbations were confirmed by selective Tau loss in WT adult brain and reverted by Tau re-expression or pharmacologically-induced epigenetic correction in cTau-KOs. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the contribution of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain malfunction that could be relevant in diverse brain pathologies beyond AD, associated to Tau and its dysfunction.",

      "title": "Data quality biases normative models derived from fetal brain MRI",
      "content": "Normative modeling is increasingly used to characterize typical growth trajectories and identify atypical neurodevelopment, including early brain development using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired before birth. Recent work has emphasized the importance of large sample sizes for accurate and robust centile estimation. In this study, we investigate how image quality influences fetal brain normative models, a critical factor in this context where MRI is acquired on a moving fetus in utero. Using a multi-centric cohort of 635 fetal MRI scans, we applied a standardized visual quality control (QC) protocol with continuous quality ratings. We fit normative models for multiple brain structures under progressively relaxed QC stringency, and quantified the deviations in centile estimates relative to a high-quality reference subgroup. Our results showed that including lower-quality data systematically biased normative centiles, with the strongest effects observed in the outer centiles, particularly the lower tail (1st-10th). Bias increased progressively as QC stringency was relaxed and could not be attributed solely to the number of subjects used to fit the models. Quality-induced bias was structure-dependent, and often not visually apparent at the segmentation level. These findings highlight that image quality is an important source of bias in normative fetal brain modeling, and that increasing sample size at the expense of quality may systematically affect centile estimates, potentially jeopardizing the utility of the model.",

      "title": "Biophysically realistic network-level transport model of tau progression with exosome-mediated release and uptake processes",
      "content": "The spatiotemporal progression of tau aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's follows the brain's structural connectome, yet a profound gap exists between the slow macroscopic spread observed over years and the rapid protein kinetics occurring over hours. Current graph-diffusion models fail to reconcile this timescale disparity or incorporate the cellular mechanisms driving transmission. Here, we advance the Network Transport Model (NTM) to bridge these scales by integrating directional active transport along microtubules, continuous toxic tau production, and exosome-mediated trans-neuronal release and uptake. This framework constitutes one of the most mechanistically complete and biologically detailed models of tau spread on the whole brain to date, representing a significant innovation in how multiscale proteinopathies are simulated. To overcome the computational complexity of the underlying partial differential equations, we developed a quasi-static approximation that separates fast axonal transport from slow network-wide exchange. Simulations on the whole-brain mouse connectome demonstrate that this framework emergently replicates empirical tau propagation patterns without the need for case-specific empirical fitting. Our results identify trans-neuronal release and uptake rates as the primary mechanistic \"bottleneck\" on macroscopic spread, providing a biologically grounded explanation for the disease's slow progression. Furthermore, we find that high aggregation rates can paradoxically sequester tau within neurons, limiting global transmission, while transport polarity (anterograde vs. retrograde) fundamentally dictates spatial patterning. By linking molecular mechanics to system-wide pathology, this model provides a predictive \"in-silico\" framework to evaluate how cellular-targeted interventions might alter the trajectory of tauopathic dementias.",

      "content": "There is a pressing need for effective alternatives to opioid analgesics, the development of which requires the identification of novel anti-nociceptive drug targets. Here, we have further investigated the anti-nociceptive properties of a GPR35 agonist, cromolyn, in an in vitro model of inflammatory sensitisation. We used ratiometric Ca2+ imaging of cultured sensory neurons to examine the effect of cromolyn on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated sensitisation of the pro-nociceptive ion channel, transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1). The sensitisation of TRPV1 by PGE2 was inhibited by cromolyn in a GPR35-dependent manner. These observations provide further evidence in support of an anti-nociceptive role for GPR35, highlighting the potential use of GPR35 agonists as analgesics.",

      "title": "A novel protocol for the efficient generation of all three major hippocampal neuronal sub-populations from human pluripotent stem cells",
      "content": "The diverse computational functions of the human hippocampus rely on coordinated interactions among dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subfields, yet generating all three neuronal identities in vitro - particularly CA1 - has remained challenging. Here we establish a reproducible and modular differentiation protocol that directs human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through dorsomedial telencephalic progenitors to yield DG, CA3, and CA1 neuronal subtypes together with hippocampal regionally specified astrocytes. Early tri-inhibition combined with Sonic hedgehog suppression produced dorsal forebrain progenitors (FOXG1+, PAX6+), while FGF2 treatment supported progenitor maintenance and induced TBR2+ intermediate progenitors. Controlled WNT activation using CHIR99021 drove progressive enrichment of PROX1 hippocampal progenitors across two independent donor lines. Terminal differentiation produced MAP2+/TAU+ neurons that expressed DG (PROX1), CA3 (GRIK4), and CA1 (WFS1, OCT6) markers, with maturing synaptic puncta. Defined progenitors generated long-lived (>400 days) hippocampal organoids exhibiting mixed neuronal-glial populations and spontaneous activity characterized by increased firing rates, high information entropy, and hub-like causal connectivity relative to monolayers, whereas astrocytes-supplemented monolayers displayed intermediate maturation. Population level electrophysiological analysis was also conducted to explore the dynamics of these different cultures. This platform enables systematic experimental control over neuron-astrocyte ratios, culture geometry, and developmental timing, providing a foundation for mechanistic studies of human hippocampal development, circuit function, and disease.",

      "title": "CaMKII\u03b1 holoenzymes self-organize into worm-like mesoscale clusters",
      "content": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is highly enriched in dendritic spines at concentrations comparable to those of cytoskeletal proteins and plays a central role in synaptic plasticity. During long-term potentiation (LTP), CaMKII further accumulates in spines. However, the mechanisms governing its higher-order organization remain poorly understood. Here, we use high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize inter-holoenzyme interaction of CaMKII at mesoscopic scales (5-500 nm). Under freely diffusible conditions, CaMKII holoenzymes do not form stable clusters. In contrast, when spatially confined, they assemble into worm-like chain clusters mediated by kinase-domain interactions. These clusters expand upon activation, concomitant with the dissociation of the regulatory segment. Notably, the CaMKII P212L mutant associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, forms extensive clusters even in the basal state. Together, our findings demonstrate that CaMKII-CaMKII interactions drive mesoscale cluster formation and that precise regulation of cluster size and activation-dependent growth might be critical for synaptic signaling.",

      "content": "The role of the choroid plexus (CP) as the primary source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains controversial. Here, we used dynamic indirect D2O magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4T to investigate whole-brain CSF dynamics in rats. Spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) was performed during intravenous D2O infusion with a temporal resolution of 10.69 s and an in-plane resolution of 150 * 150 um. An echo time of 150.0 ms was employed to effectively suppress signals from brain parenchyma, blood, and interstitial fluid, resulting in preferential visualization of CSF. The ambient and supracerebellar cisterns (AC+SC) exhibited the greatest signal attenuation, reaching 47.32 +- 15.70% of baseline, whereas the lateral ventricles (LV1, LV2) showed smaller reductions (68.73 +- 18.72%-72.64 +- 15.07% of baseline). CSF production rates were quantified using a one-compartment perfusion model. Estimated secretion rates were 0.11 and 0.13 uL/min in the lateral ventricles and 1.30 uL/min in the AC+SC region, indicating a 5.42-fold higher CSF production outside the ventricles. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence that the lateral ventricles are not the primary site of CSF production. The proposed D2O-based dynamic SE-EPI approach is safe, non-invasive, cost-effective, and suitable for widespread application.",

      "content": "The shoulder complex is a unique musculoskeletal structure capable of versatile motor behaviour yet requiring delicate control. The purpose of our work was to better understand the nature of musculoskeletal redundancy at the shoulder accounting for biomechanical demands and motor control strategies. Using a biomechanical model of the shoulder, we simulated a series of static exertions. Joint moment results from inverse dynamics were combined with an iterative sampling method to survey the landscape of feasible muscle activity patterns. By repeating the sampling process across different numbers of degrees of freedom at the shoulder, we demonstrate how emergent solutions are shaped by the biomechanical demands at each of the shoulder joints. Furthermore, we observed that the degree of musculoskeletal redundancy appears to be higher among the scapulohumeral muscles than the thoracohumeral and thoracoscapular muscles. Finally, we found that many of the muscle activity patterns requiring similar effort costs as the minimal effort solution have similar activation profiles, but there can be a wide range of possibilities especially at greater task intensities. Altogether, the simulations provide insight into neuromuscular control and musculoskeletal model decision-making process for the shoulder.",
