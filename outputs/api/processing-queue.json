      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
      "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

      "title": "SimulScan and Partial Least Squares: Visualizing swallowing through functional and dynamic imaging correlations",
      "content": "Purpose: Swallowing is a complex function involving the precise coordination of muscles, nerves, and brain areas, and can be disrupted in a variety of neurological conditions. Current imaging studies to visualize the central control of swallowing cannot examine both the biomechanics of the swallow and the brain activity associated with swallow events. An updated version of SimulScan is introduced that provides high-quality and high-speed dynamic imaging, together with fMRI acquisitions, to enable data-driven analysis of swallowing function through a partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis. Methods: Integrating updated dynamic imaging approaches, SimulScan can achieve dynamic MRI at 23.75 frames per second and BOLD fMRI at a 1.6 s TR. Five subjects were recruited and scanned with SimulScan twice and with videofluoroscopy to compare the preliminary reliability of measuring swallowing biomechanics and the test-retest relationship in correlated functional and dynamic components of PLSC. Results: High reliability of biomechanical measures of swallowing were achieved across the two SimulScan runs. In addition, these showed moderate correlation with videofluorscopy measures. Correlations between dynamic and functional imaging across runs also showed high reliability indicating that SimulScan with PLSC can extract maps of linked correlations between the brain and the oropharyngeal region. Conclusion: The updated version of SimulScan with PLSC analysis enables the study of central control of swallowing, providing simultaneous biomechanical visualization of the swallow along with brain functional signals.",

      "title": "Symmetry breaking and avalanche shapes in modular neural networks",
      "content": "Modularity is as a key characteristic of structural and functional brain networks across species and spatial scales. We investigate the stochastic Wilson-Cowan model on a modular network in which synaptic strengths differ between intra-module and inter-module connections. The system exhibits a rich phase diagram comprising symmetric (SL and SH) and \"broken symmetry\" (B1, B2, ...) phases. The phase SL (SH) is characterized by the same low (high) activity in all the modules, while the Bm phases are characterized by a high activity in m modules and low activity in the remaining modules. Between SL and SH, and between SL and B1, there are two lines of critical points, where the system shows a critical behaviour, with power law distributions in the avalanches. Along these lines, avalanche shapes differ systematically: they are symmetric or right-skewed at the SL-SH transition, but can become left-skewed over intermediate durations along the SL-B1 critical line. These results provide a theoretical framework that accounts for both symmetric and left-skewed neural avalanche shapes observed experimentally, linking modular organization to critical brain dynamics.",

      "title": "The Impact of Different Learning Processes on Acquisition, Transfer, and Proprioception in Complex Motor Tasks",
      "content": "Motor skill learning involves multiple mechanisms, including use-dependent learning (UDL), reinforcement learning (RL), and error-based learning (EBL). These operate over different time scales and neural pathways, contributing uniquely to skill acquisition, consolidation, and transfer. Here we asked how these mechanisms support the acquisition of a spatially complex maze navigation task in five groups of healthy young adults. Groups received one of five types of feedback during training of their unseen dominant hand: UDL (no feedback), RL (binary success/failure feedback with a static threshold), RLA (binary feedback with an adaptive threshold), RLB (binary feedback with adaptive threshold and brief flash of cursor feedback), or EBL (continuous real-time cursor feedback). Skill, transfer, and proprioceptive acuity were assessed pre- and post- training using a speed-accuracy function (SAF) for each hand and a two-alternative forced-choice shape discrimination task. Results showed that UDL and RL groups exhibited no improvement post-training, while EBL, RLA, and RLB groups demonstrated accuracy improvements. EBL and RLB participants experienced a significant reduction in movement variability, with EBL showing a greater decrease compared to UDL. The left-hand SAF revealed improvements in accuracy across all groups except UDL. All groups showed reduced variability in the left hand, suggesting intermanual transfer, with EBL transferring more variability improvements than UDL. No significant proprioceptive changes were observed in any group. These findings provide new insights into motor skill learning, emphasizing that even minimal feedback can facilitate complex skill acquisition and transfer and has significant implications for studies where error-based learning may not be applicable.",

      "title": "Evidence for an Active Handoff between Hemispheres during Target Tracking",
      "content": "<p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This \"handshaking\" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>",
