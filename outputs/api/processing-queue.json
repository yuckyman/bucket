      "title": "The impact of dynamic reversal potential on the evolution of action potential attributes during spike trains",
      "content": "Action potentials (AP) are the basic elements of information processing in the nervous system. Understanding AP generation mechanisms is a critical step to understand how neurons encode information. However, an individual neuron might fire APs with various shapes even in response to the same stimulus, and the mechanisms responsible for this variability remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed four AP attributes including AP rapidity and threshold during consecutive bursts from three neuron types using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. In response to consecutive current steps, the AP attributes in evoked spike trains show two distinctive patterns across different neurons: (1) The first APs from each train always have comparable properties regardless of the stimulus strength; (2) The attributes of the subsequent APs during each pulse monotonically change during the burst, where the magnitude of AP attribute change during each pulse increases with increasing stimulation strength. Various conductance-based models were explored to determine if they replicated the observed AP bursts. The observed patterns could not be replicated using the classical HH-type models, or modified HH model with cooperative Na+ gating. However, adding ion concentration dynamics to the model reproduced the AP attribute variation, and the magnitude of change during a pulse correlated with change in dynamic reversal potential (DRP), but failed to replicate the first AP attributes pattern. Then, the role of cooperative Na+ gating on neuronal firing dynamics was investigated. Inclusion of cooperative gating restored the first APs\u2019 attributes and enhanced the magnitude of modeled variation of some AP attributes to better agree with observed data. We conclude that changes in local ion concentrations could be responsible for the monotonic change in APs attributes during neuronal bursts, and cooperative gating of Na+ channels can enhance the effect. Thus, the two mechanisms could contribute to the observed variability in neuronal response.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "content": "Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interface (MI-BCI) has garnered considerable attention due to its potential for neural plasticity. However, the limited number of MI-EEG samples per subject and the susceptibility of features to noise and artifacts posed significant challenges for achieving high decoding performance. To address this problem, a Data-Augmented Multi-Scale Temporal Attention Convolutional Network (AMANet) was proposed. The network mainly consisted of four modules. First, the data augmentation module comprises three steps: sliding-window segmentation to increase sample size, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extraction of discriminative spatial features, and linear scaling to enhance network robustness. Then, multi-scale temporal convolution was incorporated to dynamically extract temporal and spatial features. Subsequently, the ECA attention mechanism was integrated to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weights of different channels. Finally, depthwise separable convolution was utilized to fully integrate and classify the deep extraction of temporal and spatial features. In 10-fold cross-validation, the results show that AMANet achieves classification accuracies of 84.06 and 85.09% on the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, respectively, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Incep-EEGNet. On the High-Gamma dataset, AMANet attains a classification accuracy of 95.48%. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of AMANet in motor imagery decoding tasks.",

      "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "content": "Objective: This article aimed to examine the psychometric properties of a measure of youth fear-avoidance of concussive symptoms. Method: Fear-avoidance is thought to be a risk factor for prolonged concussion recovery; however, current measures of fear-avoidance focus on pain rather than broader symptoms. We adapted the Fear of Pain Questionnaire to be relevant to concussion symptoms with a new version called the Fear of Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (FOCSQ). We assessed the psychometrics of this scale with a sample of <em>N</em> = 115 youth with persistent postconcussive symptoms (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 15.1 years, 58% female, 70% non-Hispanic White, 15% Hispanic, <em>M</em> = 79.2 days since injury), including reliability, construct validity, and cross-informant reliability. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor model was a good fit for youth report (fear and avoidance) and a three-factor model for parent proxy (fear, school/social avoidance, and movement avoidance). Reliability was excellent, with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for both youth report and parent proxy of 0.93 (95% CI [0.91, 0.95]). Construct validity indicated moderate correlation between youth-report FOCSQ and concussive symptoms 0.55 (95% CI [0.41, 0.66]), headache severity 0.37 (95% CI [0.19, 0.53]), depression 0.62 (95% CI [0.49, 0.72]), and anxiety 0.64 (95% CI [0.51, 0.73]). Criterion-related validity was supported by an inverse correlation between FOCSQ and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: \u22120.64 (95% CI [\u22120.74, \u22120.52]). Youth report and parent proxy were moderately correlated, with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient <em>r</em> = 0.60 (95% CI [0.47, 0.71]). Conclusions: The FOCSQ is a reliable and valid measure of fear-avoidance in youth with concussion, and future research might explore whether this measure could be used to identify youth at risk for prolonged recovery.

      "title": "Phonological networks remain intact in multiple sclerosis.",
      "content": "Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition characterized by white and gray matter decline that leads to slower motor function and cognitive impairment. Although language remains relatively intact, individuals with MS often have word retrieval difficulties. Previous research suggests that these difficulties may be related to vocabulary, the number of words an individual knows, and other semantic aspects of language. However, few studies have examined phonological aspects of speech. Method: We examined speech in 89 individuals with MS and 88 age-matched neurotypical adults using a phonemic verbal fluency task. We took a network science approach, building a phonological network from participants\u2019 responses and their close phonological neighbors. We then examined the local network characteristics (degree, clustering coefficient) of participants\u2019 responses to assess whether responses differed between the groups. Results: Although individuals with MS produced fewer responses during the task, the network characteristics of their responses were similar to neurotypical adults, the control group. Moreover, lexical characteristics such as word length and lexical frequency were also similar between groups (model <em>R</em>\u00b2 values < 1%). Finally, a forward flow analysis, which quantifies the phonological similarity between adjacent responses and provides a metric of how people search phonemic space, did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that phonological aspects of speech remain stable in individuals with MS. Word retrieval difficulties in MS may arise from neurological changes in semantic processes, in combination with other cognitive abilities such as speed of processing and executive function, which are common in MS.

      "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",
