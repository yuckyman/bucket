      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> PyVq is a Python library for vector quantization. It helps reduce the size of high-dimensional vectors like vector embeddings. It can help with memory use and also make similarity search faster.</p> <p>Currently, PyVq has these features.</p> <ul> <li>Implementations for BQ, SQ, PQ, and TSVQ algorithms.</li> <li>Support for SIMD acceleration and multi-threading.</li> <li>Support for zero-copy operations.</li> <li>Support for Euclidean, cosine, and Manhattan distances.</li> <li>A uniform API for all quantizer types.</li> <li>Storage reduction of 50 percent or more for input vectors.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> AI and ML engineers who optimize vector storage in production. Data scientists who work with high-dimensional embedding datasets. Python developers who want vector compression in their applications. For example, to speed up semantic search.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> I'm aware of very few similar libraries for Python. There is a package called vector-quantize-pytorch that implements a few quantization algorithms in PyTorch. However, there are a few big differences between the PyVq and vector-quantize-pytorch. PyVq's main usefulness is for storage reduction. It can help reduce the storage size for vector data in RAG applications and speed up search. Vector-quantize-pytorch is mainly for deep learning tasks. It helps speed up model training.</p> <p><strong>Why I Made This</strong> I started PyVq because it is an extension of its parent project Vq (which is a vector quantization library for Rust). More people are familiar with Python than Rust, including AI engineers and data scientists, so I made PyVq to make Vq available to a broader audience and make it more useful.</p> <p><strong>Source code</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/CogitatorTech/vq/tree/main/pyvq\">https://github.com/CogitatorTech/vq/tree/main/pyvq</a></p> <p><strong>Installation</strong></p> <pre><code>pip install pyvq </code></pre> <p>pip install pyvq</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Pomegranate7508\"> /u/No_Pomegranate7508 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlm4hf/pyvq_a_vector_quantization_library_for_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qlm4hf/pyvq_a_vector_quantization_library_for_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",
