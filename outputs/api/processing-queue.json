      "title": "Anxious vision: Trait-like visual cortical hyperactivity in trait anxiety",
      "content": "Sensory processing varies across individuals, often manifesting as distinct traits. Some traits, particularly sensory hypersensitivity, even to basic non-valenced stimuli, are closely linked to emotional traits and implicated in a diversity of psychiatric disorders. Extant theories attribute this sensory-emotion linkage to limbic and prefrontal modulation, but empirical support remains limited. Meanwhile, it is increasingly recognized that sensory cortex supports flexible, value-based processing beyond labeled-line sensory analysis. Assaying early visual cortical activity (using visual evoked potentials/VEPs) across four high-density electroencephalogram (hd-EEG) experiments, involving three independent samples (N = 150) and repeated assessments (up to three waves), we identify a reliable and generalizable pattern of visual cortical hyperactivity related to high trait anxiety. Notably, this effect was specific to the parvocellular (vs. magnocellular) pathway, emerging as early as 46 ms and localized to V1. Underscoring its trait-like stability, the effect was reproducible across different arousal states, neutral and negative stimuli, extended time intervals, and varied experimental paradigms. Moreover, its ecological validity was affirmed by its presence in response to both basic low-level stimuli (Gabor patches) and complex real-world images. Crucially, an excitation-inhibition (E/I) ratio (indexed by the resting-state EEG aperiodic exponent; 1/f slope) predicted parvocellular VEP magnitude in subjects with low but not high trait anxiety, suggesting disrupted E/I modulation in trait anxiety underpins this hyperactivity. We conclude that in trait anxiety, early visual processing deviates from strict fidelity to physical-world input or mere subservience to top-down modulation, instead adapting to an individual biological propensity at the earliest processing stage.",

      "title": "A Neurodevelopment-Inspired Deep Spiking Neural Network for Auditory Spatial Attention Detection using Single Trial EEG",
      "content": "This study presents a deep probabilistic spiking neural network designed to extract discriminative spatiotemporal features from EEG signals associated with rightward and leftward auditory attention. The network self-organizes its synaptic weights and inter-layer connectivity through a biologically inspired learning rule shaped by probabilistic feedback inhibition and spike-based synchronization dynamics. To characterize the model behavior and identify optimal operating conditions, we systematically examined the effects of key parameters including inhibition strength, synchronization parameters, and preprocessing thresholds on network stability and classification performance. Simulation results show that feedback inhibition is essential for preventing uncontrolled synaptic growth, maintaining sparse connectivity, and enabling stable learning. Strong inhibition suppresses connectivity and weight development, whereas weak inhibition leads to excessive synaptic expansion. An intermediate inhibition regime achieves a balance between adaptability and stability, resulting in the most effective feature extraction. Output-layer neurons exhibited heterogeneous activation dynamics, reflecting diverse encoding of EEG input patterns. The excitatory firing probability was tightly modulated by the inhibition parameter, confirming its central role in shaping network responses. Synchronization parameters further influenced synaptic dynamics, producing nonlinear effects on spike coordination and weight evolution. Classification accuracy peaked at intermediate synchronization levels, revealing an optimal regime where inhibition and synchronization jointly support efficient classification of rightward and leftward EEG data. Additional analyses demonstrated that synaptic pruning substantially improves accuracy across all inhibition levels and that the model performs best when input spikes are generated using a preprocessing threshold of 0.3. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that the developed neural network model achieves an average accuracy of 90% while utilizing only 10% of the available EEG data. Overall, the findings show that the proposed spiking neural network achieves its highest classification performance under moderate inhibition, intermediate synchronization, sparse connectivity, and appropriate pruning. These results highlight the promise of biologically inspired spiking architectures for decoding EEG-based attentional states, particularly in settings with limited training data and strong temporal structure.",

      "title": "Explainable 3D CNNs link regional and network level disruption in early Parkinson's MRIs to symptom progression",
      "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population over 65. Clinical diagnosis typically depends on tracking gradually developing motor symptoms as the disease progresses, underscoring the need for early detection methods to aid intervention while symptoms are still minor. Inexpensive and widely available imaging modalities such as T1-weighted MRI (T1w MRI) have potential for early PD diagnosis but lack established systematic biomarkers of PD pathology. In this study, a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) was trained on 100 predominately early-state PD and 100 control T1w MRIs from Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), achieving a classification accuracy of 84.5%. Misclassified subjects were majority unmedicated and particularly early PD (< 3 years since first symptoms). To interrogate the biological basis behind the model's decisions, novel explainability methods were applied to generate regional saliency maps from both PD and control classifications. Regional saliency across subjects correlated best with cognitive and motor scores in nigrostriatal and other subcortical regions, as well as in temporal and insular cortices, indicating changes in these areas were best connected with symptom progression. The model was also sensitive to changes in the left frontal cortex across many subjects, which exhibited the greatest raw saliency magnitude. Pairwise saliency correlation was most pronounced between areas within the same functional network, suggesting the CNN was sensitive to network level changes in structural MRI. These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable 3D CNNs to identify network and regional biomarkers of early PD from T1w MRI.",

      "title": "Chronic cervical vibration ameliorates depression-like behavior in Wistar-Kyoto rats",
      "content": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric condition, and a substantial proportion of patients exhibit inadequate responses to conventional pharmacotherapy. Somatosensory processing abnormalities and altered thalamo-cortical connectivity have been implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, raising the possibility that targeted somatosensory stimulation may modulate affective circuits. Here, we examined whether chronic cervical vibration improves depression-like behaviors in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, a well-established model of treatment-resistant depression. Rats received repeated vibration stimulation applied to the cervical region. Behavioral effects were evaluated using the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and the forced swim test (FST). Swimming activity was quantified during the late-phase of the FST to exclude early panic-like behavior. Immunohistochemistry for c-Fos was performed in the dorsal raphe (DR), lateral habenula (LHb), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Vibration-treated rats showed significantly shorter feeding latencies in the NSFT and significantly increased swimming distance during the analysis period of the FST. No significant group differences in c-Fos expression were observed in DR, LHb, PVN, or PFC. These findings indicate that chronic cervical vibration produces reproducible improvements in depressive-like behavior in WKY rats. Because c-Fos activity remained unchanged, the behavioral effects may reflect gradual changes in broader network processing rather than acute activation of monoaminergic or habenular-prefrontal pathways. Cervical vibration represents a simple, non-invasive sensory intervention with translational potential. Additional mechanistic studies are warranted.",

Traditionally, a two-level approach is used to model the behavior of a group of participants, where psychometric functions are first fitted to individual participant data, followed by hypothesis testing across participants on parameters of interest. Recent studies have introduced alternative approaches based on hierarchical models, such as Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Models within the Bayesian Hierarchical Framework (BHF), to analyze in a single framework the responses from multiple participants. These two approaches can be effectively implemented in R, thanks to its flexibility and robust statistical capabilities. Here, we provide a tutorial on how to model and analyze data from psychophysical experiments in R, using both two-level and hierarchical frameworks. Our goal is to provide researchers with a practical guide for building a complete and reproducible analysis pipeline, using core R functionalities together with custom packages, and facilitate rigorous and efficient data analysis in psychophysics.",
