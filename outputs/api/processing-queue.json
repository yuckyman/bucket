      "title": "A system for high-throughput axonal imaging of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human i3Neurons",
      "content": "Neurons have long, thin axons and branched dendritic processes which rely on an extensive microtubule network that functions as a cellular scaffold and substrate for cargo transport. Microtubule defects are a defining pathological feature of neurological disorders. The highly arborized, long, polarized neuronal processes pose challenges for imaging-based assays. Available methods use either dispersed cultures, which are inefficient for compartment-specific analyses, or microfluidic chambers, which allow clear separation of somatodendritic and axonal compartments but are expensive and difficult to maintain. Here, we introduce an i3Neurosphere culture model of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human cortical i3Neurons that enables high-throughput imaging of hundreds of axons without specialized equipment. We characterize neurite outgrowth, polarization, microtubule dynamics, and motility of diverse cargo, providing a reference for future work on microtubule processes in this system. The high-throughput compartment-specific imaging we present, combined with facile genetic engineering in i3Neurons provides a powerful tool to study human neurons.",

      "title": "Neurometabolic signatures of gastrointestinal symptoms in the insula of Crohn\u2019s disease patients: explorative findings from a 7T MRS study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe bidirectional communication between the brain and gut in Crohn\u2019s disease is increasingly acknowledged, highlighting how gut inflammation can influence brain function and psychological health, and vice versa, through the gut-brain axis. The insula is critical for processing pain, its emotional evaluation, and for regulating neurometabolites involved in these processes. The role of insular neurometabolites in gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly pain, in Crohn\u2019s disease patients, however, is not well-understood, highlighting the need for further investigation. Therefore, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the connection between Crohn\u2019s disease and brain function by investigating neurometabolic profiles in the insula of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease.MethodsIn this study, 7 Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was utilized to examine the left insular cortex in 14 individuals with Crohn\u2019s disease and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls during resting state. Participants also completed neuropsychological evaluations, including the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS).ResultsNo significant differences were found in the absolute concentrations of insular neurometabolites between Crohn\u2019s disease patients and healthy controls. However, in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, GSRS scores were negatively correlated with the neurometabolites aspartate (Asp) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) in the insula. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between scores on the PCS magnification subscale and concentrations of neurometabolites\u2014namely glutamine (Gln) and the combined glutamate and glutamine signal (Glx) \u2014as measured by (1H-MRS).ConclusionThe neurometabolic alterations observed in the insular cortex of Crohn\u2019s disease patients suggest increased insular activity, which may enhance interoceptive awareness and pain sensitivity, potentially contributing to heightened pain catastrophizing.",

      "title": "Chronotype-specific impacts of sleep-wake schedule on behavioral, physiological and psychological parameters",
      "content": "Diurnal variations in human performance are known to be associated with chronotype, which reflects individual differences in preferred sleep -wake cycles. Early chronotypes (ECs) exhibit superior motor and cognitive functions in the morning, whereas late chronotypes (LCs) tend to perform better in the evening. However, previous studies have examined these patterns under socially imposed nighttime sleep schedules, without considering individuals' preferred sleep timing. Thus, it remains unclear whether these chronotype-dependent performance peaks persist when individuals follow their preferred sleep schedules. To address this question, we measured subjective states, sleep pressure (using electroencephalography), and motor and cognitive functions at 1.5 and 12.5 hours after awakening under two conditions: the Clock-Time condition (10:30 PM - 6:30 AM sleep aligned with social rhythms) and the Self-Time condition (8 hours of sleep aligned with individual preferences). The results revealed distinct chronotype-specific patterns. ECs exhibited increases in fatigue and sleepiness dependent on awake duration, showing typical sleep pressure accumulation . LCs were more affected by sleep timing and showed atypical patterns of sleep pressure accumulation compared with ECs. Motor ability tended to improve in the afternoon in both chronotypes, irrespective of sleep-wake schedule, whereas cognitive performance peaked at different stages of wakefulness -earlier for ECs and later for LCs- independent of the time of day. These findings suggest that chronotype-aligned sleep-wake schedules could help optimize fatigue management, cognitive performance, and motor control. Diurnal variations in performance cannot be attributed to clock time alone but emerge from the combined effects of chronotype, awake duration, and sleep-wake regulation.",

      "title": "Consistent Neural Representation of Affective States between Watching and Recall using fNIRS",
      "content": "People tend to recall similar feelings when remembering the same event. Yet the neural mechanisms by which emotional valence and arousal are represented during perception and later recall remain unclear. Here, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record prefrontal cortex activity while participants viewed and then freely recalled short video clips designed to elicit four affective states (amusement, calmness, disgust, and sadness). Multidimensional scaling revealed that both modality-general (shared across viewing and recall) and modality-specific (unique to each phase) dimensions of valence and arousal were significant, and cross-modal classification successfully decoded valence and arousal. Our results support a hierarchical model in which a stable core affect is preserved across perception and memory, while context-dependent refinements adapt emotional representations during recall. This work highlights fNIRS as a useful tool for studying emotional memory in ecologically valid settings and lays groundwork for multimodal imaging of affective replay.",
