      "title": "Brain-wide Organization of Post-Synaptic Sites: Three Principles",
      "content": "Synapses are fundamental units of neural computation and structural plasticity in the brain, yet their brain-wide spatial organization in mammals remains largely unknown. Building on our previous mapping and modeling of dendritic spines and axonal boutons, we developed a statistical approach to generate over 17.99 million predicted post-synaptic sites based on the potential arbor contacts (PPSSPAC) across the dendritic arbors of 155,743 neurons spanning the entire mouse brain. By analyzing the topological features of these sites, we identified three key organizational principles. First, PPSSPAC exhibits a distinct region-specific spatial pattern at the dendritic branch level, preferentially enriching near the distal ends of dendritic segments, in contrast to the valley-like distribution of pre-synaptic sites along axonal branches. Cross-species validation against independent electron microscopy datasets from mouse and human brains, revealed a conserved and previously unquantified pattern of synaptic organization. Second, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC effectively captures variations across cell types in the hippocampus, enabling neuron classification based on synaptic architecture. This serves as a complementary mesoscale descriptor to existing classifications based on global neuronal connectivity (source-target relationships) or local dendritic microenvironments. Third, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC, rather than synapse density, shows remarkable correlation with independent whole-brain electrophysiological activity. The spatial organization of PPSSPAC also correlates with several gene expression datasets. These results suggest the post-synaptic pattern could be mediator linking molecular signatures, neural dynamics, and connectivity types of cells. Our study reveals, for the first time, a structural substrate for hierarchical information processing in the brain, providing new insights into neural computation and a foundation for brain digital twin models to support next-generation AI infrastructure.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "Neuronal excitability and parameter variability in the Hodgkin-Huxley model",
      "content": "Biophysically detailed neuron models are often built as a one-way pipeline in which voltage-clamp data are reduced to a single set of best-fit channel parameters, which are then combined into a deterministic spiking model. This practice discards experimentally observed variability and obscures the mechanisms by which robustness and degeneracy arise in excitable systems. Here, we reintroduce parameter variability into the Hodgkin-Huxley model and embed uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis into model construction. We digitized sodium and potassium rate constant data from the original Hodgkin and Huxley figures and used bootstrap resampling to estimate the variability of the voltage-dependent kinetic parameters. We then propagated these uncertainty estimates through a spatially extended squid axon cable model using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. At the channel level, first-order Sobol sensitivity indices revealed that all kinetic parameters contribute to output variance in a strongly time-dependent manner, with distinct parameters controlling transient and steady-state behavior for potassium and sodium conductances. At the level of neuronal excitability, sampling hundreds of thousands of parameter sets produced a heterogeneous population of firing behaviors, including non-firing, phasic, regular, and spontaneous activity. Across stimulus amplitudes, the dominant firing mode was a single spike at stimulus onset. At the same time, the regularly firing subpopulation exhibited a broad distribution of firing rates, with a mean that matched the classic Hodgkin-Huxley prediction. In the phasic subpopulation, action potential propagation and conduction velocity varied widely yet remained consistent with experimental ranges. Finally, global sensitivity analysis during spiking shows uniformly small first-order indices but large total-order indices, indicating that excitability is primarily governed by strong interactions among parameters rather than by any single conductance or kinetic parameter. These results support a population-based view of conductance-based modeling in which biologically relevant behavior emerges from structured regions of parameter space.",
