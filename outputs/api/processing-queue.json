      "title": "Impaired development of the medial olivocochlear system in a KCNQ4-deficient mouse model.",
      "content": "The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system modulates outer hair cell (OHC) excitability and protects cochlea from overstimulation. Cholinergic activation of alpha9alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) triggers Ca+2 influx, activating BK and SK2 Ca+2-dependent K+; channels, and K+ extrusion through KCNQ4 to restore membrane potential. KCNQ4-loss causes chronic depolarization, OHC dysfunction, and hearing loss. Here, we investigated how KCNQ4 deficiency affects cochlear efferent synapse development and organization. Using confocal immunofluorescence, we analyzed efferent innervation in the organ of Corti of Kcnq4-/- (KO) and Kcnq4+/+ (WT) mice at 2, 3, 4, and 10 postnatal weeks (W). At 2 W, efferent terminals were similarly distributed between basal and lateral OHC membrane domains in both genotypes. During maturation, WT mice exhibited complete relocation of MOC terminals to the basal domain, whereas KO mice showed delayed maturation, with some terminals laterally displaced up to 10 W. KCNQ4 absence was associated with reduced number and volume of efferent boutons on OHCs. Milder morphometric alterations were observed in efferent boutons within the inner hair cell region. At the molecular level, qPCR revealed downregulation of alpha10 nAChR subunit, BK, and SK2 transcripts in KO at 4 W, with recovery to 10 W. Despite this recovery, BK protein showed reduced expression, mislocalization, and disorganized synaptic plaques in OHCs. KO also displayed age-dependent upregulation of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and calretinin, suggesting compensatory responses to altered Ca+2 homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate that KCNQ4 is essential for OHC repolarization, maturation and maintenance of cochlear efferent synapses.",

      "title": "Long-Term Expression and Safety of AAV1-Mediated PI3K\u03b4 Overexpression in the Adult Rat Cortex",
      "content": "Mature CNS neurons are incapable of sufficiently regenerating their axons following spinal cord injury (SCI). This is largely due to developmental changes in epigenetic control leading to suppression of axon growth transcriptomic profile, leading to a shift towards synapse function support. Recently, manipulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway through PI3K{delta} overexpression in cortical neurons enhanced axonal regeneration of corticospinal tract axons, which was accompanied by functional recovery monitored for up to 16 weeks. However, PI3K is more widely known for its role as an oncogene, and since overexpression is achieved by the use of AAVs, valid safety concerns are raised as it is unknown what the long-term consequences of sustained PI3K{delta} expression in the brain are, which may be necessary to achieve complete re-establishment of the motor pathway. In this study, AAV1-hSYN-PIK3CD was injected into the motor cortex of rats, which survived for 1 year. Comparison with uninjected control animals reveal stable PI3K{delta} expression and sustained pathway activation through increased pS6. PI3K{delta}-treated animals show absence of tumour formation, neural soma hypertrophy, glial cell activation, or haematological or biochemical abnormalities. Thus, long-term neuronal PI3K{delta} expression appears to be well tolerated and may provide a safe and durable strategy to promote functional repair following SCI.",

      "title": "Beyond the Focus of Expansion: Retinal curl as a functional signal for heading estimation",
      "content": "Prevailing models aiming at explaining heading assume that humans need to recover the Focus of Expansion (FOE) while filtering out rotational flow (curl) caused by eye movements. We propose an alternative: the visual system utilizes retinal curl directly to estimate heading, rendering the explicit recovery of the FOE unnecessary. Stationary participants viewed simulated walking paths on a large screen while fixating on ground targets at varying eccentricities -a natural behavior inducing sustained retinal curl. Participants continuously reported perceived heading. To isolate the role of rotational flow, we employed a real-time manipulation that kept translational flow constant while the foveal curl component was either intact, cancelled, or overcancelled. Under natural conditions, participants exhibited systematic heading biases opposite the direction of gaze. Crucially, these biases vanished in the 'cancelled curl' condition, identifying retinal curl as the specific driver of perceptual bias. We modeled these results using a simple feedback controller and a ring-attractor neural network featuring gaze-contingent inhibition and a 'straight-ahead' prior. These findings suggest the brain exploits the geometry of gaze stabilization to simplify navigation, treating retinal curl as a functional signal rather than noise to be filtered.",

      "title": "The loss of Tau in the adult brain triggers neuroplastic, epigenetic and behavioral deficits",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION: Accumulation of pathological Tau precipitates neuronal malfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the impact of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain, independently of Tau aggregates, remains unclarified. METHODS: We used a mouse model with conditional mapt knocking-down in forebrain of 5-7 months old animals (cTau-KO), a virus-driven selective Tau knockdown in wild-types (WT) and Tau re-expression approaches, accompanied by neurostructural, epigenetic, proteomic, electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral analyses. RESULTS: Loss of Tau in the adult brain of cTau-KOs triggers neuronal atrophy and malfunction, epigenetic as well cognitive and mood deficits. Importantly, these perturbations were confirmed by selective Tau loss in WT adult brain and reverted by Tau re-expression or pharmacologically-induced epigenetic correction in cTau-KOs. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the contribution of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain malfunction that could be relevant in diverse brain pathologies beyond AD, associated to Tau and its dysfunction.",

      "title": "Data quality biases normative models derived from fetal brain MRI",
      "content": "Normative modeling is increasingly used to characterize typical growth trajectories and identify atypical neurodevelopment, including early brain development using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquired before birth. Recent work has emphasized the importance of large sample sizes for accurate and robust centile estimation. In this study, we investigate how image quality influences fetal brain normative models, a critical factor in this context where MRI is acquired on a moving fetus in utero. Using a multi-centric cohort of 635 fetal MRI scans, we applied a standardized visual quality control (QC) protocol with continuous quality ratings. We fit normative models for multiple brain structures under progressively relaxed QC stringency, and quantified the deviations in centile estimates relative to a high-quality reference subgroup. Our results showed that including lower-quality data systematically biased normative centiles, with the strongest effects observed in the outer centiles, particularly the lower tail (1st-10th). Bias increased progressively as QC stringency was relaxed and could not be attributed solely to the number of subjects used to fit the models. Quality-induced bias was structure-dependent, and often not visually apparent at the segmentation level. These findings highlight that image quality is an important source of bias in normative fetal brain modeling, and that increasing sample size at the expense of quality may systematically affect centile estimates, potentially jeopardizing the utility of the model.",

      "title": "Biophysically realistic network-level transport model of tau progression with exosome-mediated release and uptake processes",
      "content": "The spatiotemporal progression of tau aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's follows the brain's structural connectome, yet a profound gap exists between the slow macroscopic spread observed over years and the rapid protein kinetics occurring over hours. Current graph-diffusion models fail to reconcile this timescale disparity or incorporate the cellular mechanisms driving transmission. Here, we advance the Network Transport Model (NTM) to bridge these scales by integrating directional active transport along microtubules, continuous toxic tau production, and exosome-mediated trans-neuronal release and uptake. This framework constitutes one of the most mechanistically complete and biologically detailed models of tau spread on the whole brain to date, representing a significant innovation in how multiscale proteinopathies are simulated. To overcome the computational complexity of the underlying partial differential equations, we developed a quasi-static approximation that separates fast axonal transport from slow network-wide exchange. Simulations on the whole-brain mouse connectome demonstrate that this framework emergently replicates empirical tau propagation patterns without the need for case-specific empirical fitting. Our results identify trans-neuronal release and uptake rates as the primary mechanistic \"bottleneck\" on macroscopic spread, providing a biologically grounded explanation for the disease's slow progression. Furthermore, we find that high aggregation rates can paradoxically sequester tau within neurons, limiting global transmission, while transport polarity (anterograde vs. retrograde) fundamentally dictates spatial patterning. By linking molecular mechanics to system-wide pathology, this model provides a predictive \"in-silico\" framework to evaluate how cellular-targeted interventions might alter the trajectory of tauopathic dementias.",
