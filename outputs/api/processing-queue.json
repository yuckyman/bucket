      "content": "<p>Hi folks! Iman and I (Fabian) have been building Specific for a while now and are finally opening up our public beta.<p>Specific is a platform for building backend APIs and services entirely through natural-language specifications and tests, without writing code. We then automatically turn your specs into a working system and deploy it for you, along with any infrastructure needed.<p>We know a lot of developers who have already adopted spec-driven development to focus on high-level design and let coding agents take care of implementation. We are attempting to take this even further by making the specs themselves the source of truth. Of course, we can\u2019t blindly trust coding agents to follow the spec, so we also support adding tests that will run to ensure the system behaves as expected and to avoid regressions.<p>There is so much ground to cover, so we are focusing on a smaller set of initial features that in our experience should cover a large portion of backends:<p>- An HTTP server for each project. Authentication can be added by simply stating in the spec how you want to protect your endpoint.<p>- A database automatically spun up and schema configured if the spec indicates persistence is needed.<p>- External APIs can be called. You can even link out to API docs in your specs.<p>You currently can\u2019t see the generated code, but we are working on enabling it. Of course, we don\u2019t claim any ownership of the generated code and will gladly let you export it and continue building elsewhere.<p>Specific is free to try and we are really eager to hear your feedback on it!<p>Try it here: <a href=\"https://app.specific.dev\">https://app.specific.dev</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45595760\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45595760</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "A multimodal brain phantom for noninvasive neuromodulation",
      "content": "Noninvasive neuromodulation enables brain stimulation without surgery but requires precise optimization of stimulation parameters to ensure efficacy and safety. Direct testing on human or animal subjects is costly, time intensive, and constrained by ethical and safety considerations. To address these challenges, a low-cost, versatile brain phantom was designed to emulate key biophysical properties across multiple neuromodulation modalities. The phantom was fabricated using ground beef, sodium alginate, and starch, and cast within a custom 3D printed mold. A multimodal test platform was created and validated by integrating established principles from low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and thermal phantom design. Numerical simulations predicted a LIFU peak negative pressure of 0.631 MPa, closely matching the target Pr.3 value, with negligible temperature elevation (<0.01 {degrees}C). Consistent with prior reports, tDCS exposure did not induce lasting alterations in the phantoms physical or electrical properties. The electrical conductivity was 0.11{+/-}0.02 S/m, reflecting water saturation within the phantom matrix; the thermal conductivity averaged 0.557 W/(mK), consistent with reported values for brain tissue analogs. This study primarily evaluated LIFU and tDCS performance; future work should extend characterization to additional modalities such as deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Further assessment of the phantoms optical properties would also facilitate photobiomodulation and photoacoustic imaging studies. Overall, this inexpensive, easily fabricated phantom presents a practical and adaptable platform for multimodal neuromodulation research and parameter optimization.",

      "content": "In human-AI collaboration, task delegation is a critical component. Ideally, if a person believes they are capable of completing a task, they should do so themselves; otherwise, the task should be delegated to the other party. Such delegation decisions are influenced by individuals' assessments of their own abilities, which are shaped by metacognition-the capacity to evaluate one's own capacities. High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive brain...",
