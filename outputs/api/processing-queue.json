I don't provide IO or parallelism however (which is something that polars can do way better and for which my library is designed to interoperate fluently, see some examples in the website)</li> <li>Compared to fit_it , I'm fully typed and provide much more functionalities (collection types, interoperability between types)</li> <li>Compared to streamable (which seems like a solid alternative) I provide different types (Result, Option, collection types), should be faster for most operations (streamable reimplement in python a lot of things, I mostly delegate to cytoolz (Cython) and itertools (C) whenever possible with as less function call overhead as possible). I don't provide async functionnalities (streamable do) but it's absolutely something I could consider.</li> </ul> <p>The biggest difference in all cases is that my Iterator methods are designed to also interoperate with Option and Result when it make sense.</p> <p>For example, <code>Iter.filter_map</code> will behave like Rust filter_map (hence for Iterators of Option types).</p> <p>If you need filter_map behavior as you expect in Python, you can simply call .filter.map.<br /> This is all exhaustively documented and typed anyway.</p> <p><strong>For monads/results/returns libraries</strong>:</p> <p>There's a lot of different ones, and they all provide their own opinion and functionnalities.<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/dbrattli/Expression\">https://github.com/dbrattli/Expression</a> for example says it's derived from F.<br /> There's also Pymonad, returns, etc... all with their own API (decorators, haskell-like, etc...) and at the end of the day it's personal taste.</p> <p>My goal is to orient it as close as possible to Rust API.</p> <p>Hence, the most closely related projects are:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/rustedpy/result\">https://github.com/rustedpy/result</a> -&gt; not maintained anymore. There's a fork, but in all cases, it only provides Result and Option, not Iterators etc...</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/MaT1g3R/option\">https://github.com/MaT1g3R/option</a> -&gt; doesn't seem maintained anymore, and again, only provides Option and Result<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/rustedpy/maybe\">https://github.com/rustedpy/maybe</a> -&gt; same thing<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/mplanchard/safetywrap/blob/master/src/safetywrap/_impl.py\">https://github.com/mplanchard/safetywrap/blob/master/src/safetywrap/_impl.py</a> -&gt; same thing</p> <p>In all cases it seems like I'm the only one to provide all types and interoperability.</p> <p>Looking forward to constructive criticism!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beginning-Fruit-1397\"> /u/Beginning-Fruit-1397 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q61bzg/pyochain_rustlike_iterator_result_and_option_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q61bzg/pyochain_rustlike_iterator_result_and_option_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Grey matter microstructural alterations distinguish cognitive impairment in Lewy body diseases",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION. Despite widespread cortical involvement in Lewy body diseases, conventional grey matter MRI measures have limited sensitivity. Microstructural measures from diffusion MRI may be more sensitive to early changes. METHODS. We examined grey matter microstructure in 197 participants across the Lewy body diseases spectrum: 88 Lewy body dementia (LBD), 109 Parkinson's normal cognition (PD-NC), and 46 controls. We compared tissue-weighted neurite density (tNDI), orientation dispersion index (tODI), and free water fraction (FWF) cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We examined relationships between microstructure, disease severity and plasma p-tau217. RESULTS. LBD participants showed widespread cortical and subcortical tODI and FWF increases compared to controls and PD-NC, despite minimal atrophy. These changes correlated with cognitive (but not motor severity) and with p-tau217. In 100 Parkinson's patients followed-up over 3 years, cortical FWF increased in those developing cognitive decline. DISCUSSION. Microstructural measures capture early grey matter changes, offering a sensitive marker of grey matter integrity in Lewy body diseases.",

      "title": "Reactive Astrocytes Drive Extracellular Acidification to Mediate \u03b1-Synuclein Neurodegeneration",
      "content": "Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as key players in neurodegeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they drive disease remain elusive. Here, we uncover a fundamental pathway in which reactive astrocytes fuel neurodegeneration in -synucleinopathies-including Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia-by acidifying the brain's extracellular environment. We demonstrate that both human patient tissue and a gut-to-brain -synuclein mouse model exhibit accumulation of reactive astrocytes and extracellular acidosis. Mechanistically, we show that astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis releases acidic contents, driving a drop in pH that activates neuronal acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), resulting in neuronal loss and behavioral decline. Blocking this pathway-either by inhibiting astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis or genetically or pharmacologically targeting neuronal ASIC1a-mitigates pathology and rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo. These findings provide a conceptual advance by establishing a mechanistic link between glial inflammation, acid-base homeostasis, and neuronal vulnerability, and suggest that targeting astrocyte-driven acidification or ASIC1a signaling could offer new avenues for disease modification in -synucleinopathies.",

      "title": "Disrupted dynamics of brain structure function coupling link genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease and aging to cognitive decline in 34,067 adults",
      "content": "Understanding how a stable structural connectome supports flexible cognition, especially in aging, is a fundamental question in neuroscience. While static structure function coupling (SFC) is well-studied, the dynamic decoupling of functional activity from structural constraints, dynamic SFC (DSFC), remains poorly understood. Leveraging MRI data from 34,067 UK Biobank participants (ages 45~82), we characterized the distinct roles of SFC and DSFC in aging, cognition, and health. We found that SFC and DSFC followed spatially divergent aging trajectories: SFC declined primarily in sensorimotor systems, whereas DSFC decreased most prominently in higher order networks. Both SFC and DSFC in higher-order networks were positively correlated with cognitive performance (e.g., fluid intelligence). However, the associations with mental and physical health diverged between the two measures: reduced DSFC was predominantly linked to health burdens in high-order default/limbic networks, whereas weakened SFC was primarily associated with health burdens in low-order sensory-motor networks. Genetic analyses revealed that Alzheimer's risk, specifically APOE4 dosage, significantly reduced DSFC in higher-order cognitive networks and SFC in visual cortex. Mediation analyses further demonstrated that aging and APOE4-linked cognitive decline were mediated via visual SFC and ventral attention DSFC. These findings position static and dynamic coupling as complementary mechanisms: static SFC preserves network robustness, while dynamic SFC enables transient reconfiguration for complex integration. Together, our results highlight these dual mechanisms as crucial for maintaining cognitive flexibility, providing potential biomarkers for age-related neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Maximum entropy model reveals frequent brain state switching in psychotic disorders in a multiversal brain function analysis",
      "content": "Background: Regional activation and pairwise correlation are mainstay neuroimaging methods. Yet, neither approach fully captures how brain networks evolve and interact over time. The maximum entropy model (MEM), which integrates regional and inter-regional activity, represents a promising integrative approach to examine dynamically evolving functional networks. Methods: Activation-only, pairwise-coactivation-only analyses and an MEM framework were applied to the Human Connectome Project-Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset (109 patients, 56 controls). Using the 360-node HCP/Glasser atlas to define brain regions from the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks, group differences were quantified in nodal frequency band power, functional connectivity (FC), and MEM features such as transition rates between basins in energy landscapes and their associations with cognitive and psychopathological measures were examined. Results: Psychosis was associated with reduced first-order BOLD frequency band power and FC graph metrics. Findings specific to the MEM demonstrated a wider variety of DMN and DAN activation/deactivation patterns, with more frequent switching between them during the resting state in psychosis. Network configuration differences were more pronounced in sub-systems comprised of both DMN and DAN nodes. While BOLD frequency band power of a few regions correlated with working memory, none of the graph metrics correlated. However, basins transitions and energy correlated negatively with working memory. Conclusion: MEM provides unique information unavailable from other analyses. Results converge among first-order-only, second-order-only, and MEM analyses, suggesting attenuated inter-network connectivity with less stability of DMN and DAN brain states in psychosis. Such changes may underlie cognitive impairments, specifically basin transitions rates in psychosis.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Embex is a universal ORM for vector databases. It provides a unified Python API to interact with multiple vector store providers (currently Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, LanceDB, Milvus, Weaviate, and PgVector).</p> <p>Under the hood, it is not just a Python wrapper. I implemented the core logic in <strong>Rust</strong> using the &quot;BridgeRust&quot; framework I developed. This Rust core is compiled into a Python extension module using <strong>PyO3</strong>.</p> <p>This architecture allows Embex to perform heavy vector math operations (like cosine similarity and dot products) using SIMD intrinsics (AVX2/NEON) directly in the Rust layer, which are then exposed to Python. This results in vector operations that are roughly <strong>4x faster</strong> than standard scalar implementations, while keeping the Python API idiomatic and simple.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This library is designed for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>AI/ML Engineers</strong> building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines who want to switch between vector databases (e.g., local LanceDB/Chroma for dev, Pinecone for prod) without rewriting their data access layer.</li> <li><strong>Backend Developers</strong> who need a consistent interface for vector storage that doesn't lock them into a single vendor's SDK.</li> <li><strong>Performance enthusiasts</strong> looking for Python tools that leverage Rust for low-level optimization.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>vs. Native SDKs (e.g.,</strong> <code>pinecone-client</code><strong>,</strong> <code>qdrant-client</code><strong>):</strong> Native SDKs are tightly coupled to their specific backend. If you start with one and want to migrate to another, you have to rewrite your query logic. Embex abstracts this; you change the provider configuration, and your <code>search</code> or <code>insert</code> code remains exactly the same.</li> <li><strong>vs. LangChain VectorStores:</strong> LangChain is a massive framework where the vector store is just one small part of a huge ecosystem. Embex is a standalone, lightweight ORM focused solely on the database layer. It is less opinionated about your overall application architecture and significantly lighter to install if you don't need the rest of LangChain.</li> <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Because the vector operations happen in the compiled Rust core using SIMD instructions, Embex benchmarks at 3.6x - 4.0x faster for mathematical vector operations compared to pure Python or non-SIMD implementations.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Links &amp; Source</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust\">https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong> <code>pip install embex</code></li> <li><strong>Docs:</strong><a href=\"https://bridgerust.dev/embex/introduction\">https://bridgerust.dev/embex/introduction</a></li> </ul> <p>I would love feedback on the API design or the PyO3 bindings implementation!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent-Dance-34\"> /u/Maleficent-Dance-34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Show HN: An LLM response cache that's aware of dynamic data",
      "content": "<p>Raymond here from Butter.dev, an LLM response cache built as a chat-completions proxy. Today we're launching a key feature for the platform: the ability to generalize on dynamic, templated inputs.<p>Caching at the HTTP request level has the obvious problem of generalizability. Nearly no request is identical, due to templated variables (like names) and metadata (like timestamps), so exact-match cache lookups rarely hit. We solve this at Butter by using LLMs to detect dynamic content in requests and derive their inter-relationships, allowing the cache entry to be stored as a template + variables + deterministic code. This allows future requests to contain different variable data, yet still serve from cache.<p>We've found this approach greatly improves cache hit rate, and believe it could be useful for agents performing repetitive back-office tasks, computer use, or data transformations where input data is frequently of the same shape.<p>- You can see a demo of learning patterns here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA</a><p>- We wrote more about the technical approach here: <a href=\"https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-response-caching\">https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-...</a><p>- It's free to try out here: <a href=\"https://butter.dev/auth\">https://butter.dev/auth</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
