      "title": "Stable fusion of bone marrow-derived cells with Purkinje neurons enables long-term nuclear integration and neuronal repair",
      "content": "Developing effective strategies to replace or restore injured neurons could significantly revolutionise the treatment of currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Studies have shown that bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can migrate into the brain and fuse with damaged Purkinje neurons (PNs), restoring their structure and function. Yet, despite over two decades of research, the temporal dynamics and functional stability of these fusion events in vivo remain poorly defined, largely due to reliance on static, post-mortem histological analyses that provide only a single snapshot in time. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging of the intact cerebellum in EGFP-bone marrow chimeric mice, we visualised the dynamics of BMDC-PN interactions both in real time and longitudinally to monitor the physiological characteristics of fused PNs. Notably, we provide definitive evidence that fused cells are not transient but remain stable over extended periods in the living brain. Moreover, we demonstrate sustained transcriptional activity of donor-derived genes within fused PNs, indicating partial or complete functional integration of the BMDC nucleus. Given their accessibility and genetic tractability, BMDCs represent a practical and promising platform for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to PNs, opening new avenues for treating neurodegenerative disease.",

      "title": "Distinct neural processing of real versus unreal optic flow in the human brain",
      "content": "Visual perception of self-movement relies on optic flow, a global motion pattern generated by self-movement in a rigid 3D environment. Such optic flow conveys both 2D features (e.g., radial velocity fields and centers of motion) and 3D structural information (e.g., motion perspective). However, many previous neuroimaging studies have used simplified 2D radial motion as \"real\" optic flow, leaving it unclear whether such \"unreal\" stimuli adequately capture how the brain processes ecologically valid self-movement information. Previous behavioral work has shown that sensitivity to expansion and contraction reverses depending on whether optic flow is ecologically valid (L. Li et al., 2025), raising the question of how such differences are represented in the human brain. We conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments to systematically compare cortical processing of real versus unreal optic flow. The two stimulus types were strictly matched in 2D global features and local motion signals, differing only in whether they preserved 3D structure consistent with self-movement. To minimize task-related influences, participants performed a task-irrelevant fixation point color-change detection task during scanning. Experiment 1 used a block design in which participants viewed expanding and contracting optic flow at different motion coherence levels. Experiment 2 presented real and unreal optic flow within the same scanning session to directly test neural sensitivity to ecological validity. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that, among multiple visual and optic flow-responsive regions, the human dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST) exhibited robust and consistent sensitivity to the ecological validity of optic flow. Specifically, under real optic flow, decoding accuracy for motion coherence in MST was significantly higher for expansion than for contraction, whereas this preference was reversed under unreal optic flow. Neural threshold estimates derived from fMR-metric functions further supported this pattern reversal, indicating systematic modulation of MST sensitivity by ecological structure. Experiment 2 further demonstrated that, regardless of motion pattern, MST reliably distinguished real from unreal optic flow, with decoding accuracy increasing as motion coherence increased. These findings indicate that MST encodes not only motion patterns themselves but also whether optic flow conforms to the ecological structure of self-movement. Together, these results indicate that MST responses are not determined solely by 2D radial motion features, but are modulated by whether optic flow preserves 3D structure consistent with self-movement. This work clarifies a long-standing conflation between simplified radial motion and real optic flow and highlights the importance of ecological structure in shaping dorsal-stream motion representations related to self-movement perception.",

      "content": "Volume electron microscopy (vEM) has become a powerful tool for 3D ultrastructural analysis of neural circuits, yet its application to human brain organoids remains limited, particularly for connectomic studies. Here, we established a comprehensive and scalable workflow for applying vEM to human cortical organoids, integrating correlative light and electron microscopy, large-area SEM mosaic imaging, focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) validation. By systematically comparing two embedding protocols in use, we demonstrated that the DeFelipe and Fairen (1993)/Cano-Astorga et al. (2024) method provides optimal compatibility with toluidine blue-stained semithin sectioning and enables reliable synapse segmentation and neurite tracing. In contrast, the Deerinck et al. (2010) protocol offers enhanced membrane contrast but limits postsynaptic density visualization. Using FIB-SEM imaging of peripheral, neuropil-like regions of cortical organoids, we achieved accurate 3D reconstruction of synapses, neurites and intracellular organelles, enabling quantitative assessment of synaptic apposition surfaces, neurite trajectories, and organelle distribution across defined cellular compartments. Together, our results demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of micro-connectomic reconstruction in human cortical organoids at nanometer resolution. This methodological framework expands the applicability of vEM to organoid systems and provides a robust foundation for future studies of human brain development, disease modeling, and therapeutic evaluation at the synaptic and subcellular level.",

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge.
