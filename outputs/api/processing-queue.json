      "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

      "title": "Stimulus-specific recruitment of human amygdala neurons predicts episodic memory encoding success",
      "content": "Controlling whether a given experience is encoded into long-term memory and thus later remembered is a crucial component of our memory system whose failure is often at the root of memory disorders. One brain area that takes part in controlling which experiences are remembered is the amygdala, but the mechanisms by which it does so remain poorly understood. Here we examined single-neuron activity and local field potentials as human participants performed recognition memory tasks with visual stimuli. Category-selective amygdala neurons exhibited elevated firing rates during encoding of later remembered items versus forgotten items. This subsequent memory effect was restricted to images of the preferred category of a given cell, was stronger and appeared earlier in the amygdala compared to the hippocampus, and did not depend on the valence and arousal of the stimuli. In contrast, category selective cells immediately upstream in the ventral temporal cortex did not exhibit a subsequent memory effect, highlighting specificity to the amygdala. Successful memory formation was accompanied by enhanced spike-field coherence between the activity of category cells in the amygdala and hippocampal field potentials. These findings, replicated in two large independent datasets with two different tasks, demonstrate that recruitment of stimulus-specific amygdala representations predicts episodic memory formation, particularly in the right amygdala. This data suggests category cells in the right amygdala as a cellular target for interventions to treat memory disorders in humans.",
