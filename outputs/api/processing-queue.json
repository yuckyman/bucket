      "title": "From Stability to Complexity: A Systematic Review of Long-term Divergence Exponents in Nonlinear Gait Analysis",
      "content": "Background Divergence exponents (DE), or maximum Lyapunov exponents, computed from stride-to-stride fluctuations have traditionally been interpreted as measures of gait stability. However, evidence suggests this measure may also reflect gait complexity and automaticity. This systematic review evaluated examined empirical support for reinterpreting long-term DE as a complexity measure. Methods We systematically searched Web of Science databases through August 2024 for studies applying Rosenstein's algorithm to human gait. We systematically extracted experimental conditions, and participant characteristics from each study. Study quality was assessed using a framework evaluating analytical rigor, outcome reporting, and sample size adequacy. We conducted a meta-analysis examining correlations between long-term DEs and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling exponents, and synthesized evidence from perturbation (environmental disturbances), cueing (external rhythmic stimuli), and between-subject (clinical vs control) studies. Results Fifty-six studies published between 2000 and 2024 met inclusion criteria, with 43% achieving high overall quality scores. Meta-analysis from six datasets (209 participants) revealed a positive correlation between long-term DE and DFA scaling exponents (r=0.64, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.82; I{superscript 2}=82%). Perturbation studies consistently showed and increased short-term DE (lower local stability) while simultaneously decreasing long-term DE by up to 64%. External auditory and visual cueing interventions induced long-term DE decreases (up to -86%) while minimally affecting short-term DEs. Between-subject comparisons revealed heterogeneous patterns, with clinical populations exhibiting both increases and decreases in long-term DE depending on pathology. Conclusions Converging meta-analytic and experimental evidence supports reinterpreting long-term DE as the Attractor Complexity Index--a measure of gait complexity and automaticity rather than stability. Reduced long-term DE during controlled gait conditions reflects suppression of low-frequency variations in gait variability, which constrains phase space exploration and accelerates divergence curve saturation. The measure's sensitivity to prefrontal cortex engagement and attentional demands reveals that long-term DE captures the degree of gait automaticity, with lower values indicating a shift from automatic subcortical control to executive function-mediated regulation. This attention-dependent control reorganization explains patterns observed in aging, clinical populations, and experimental perturbations. This paradigm shift establishes long-term DE as a complementary biomarker for motor-cognitive aspects of gait control, with implications for fall risk assessment, disease monitoring, and rehabilitation evaluation.",

      "title": "A Naturalistic Study on the Combined Neural and Psychological Effects of Psilocybin and Compassion Focused Imagery",
      "content": "Psilocybin is a classic psychedelic drug known to alter subjective experience and elicit long-term psychological changes, enhancing cognitive flexibility and reducing rigid self-related beliefs. Combined with compassion motivational primes that involve generating mental representations of compassion, it may increase the potential for activating the care-affiliative motivational systems, linked to several important biopsychosocial processes underpinning social safeness, social connection and mental wellbeing. We investigated the synergetic effects of psilocybin and compassion imagery with self-reported questionnaires and functional resonance imaging data (fMRI) in a sample of 105 participants. Participants were primed with either attention to breathing or a short compassion focused imagery prime. We found a long-term synergetic effect of compassion imagery and psilocybin on cognitive absorption, as well as changes relative to baseline self-compassion and decentering. Based on functional interactions between attentional, executive and default mode networks, fMRI-based classifiers detected participant engagement in compassion focused imagery before psilocybin intake and distinguished compassion imagery vs. attention to breathing priming only the high dose of psilocybin. Our results support the potential for synergistic effects from combinations of psilocybin and compassion-based interventions to induce long-term psychological changes, reshaping the functional organization of large-scale brain networks. Future confirmatory studies of our exploratory analyses should be conducted to determine whether the combination of psilocybin and compassion-based practices promotes increases in caring and contemplative abilities, enhanced psychological flexibility and well-being.",

      "title": "Frontoamygdala hyperconnectivity predicts autonomic dysregulation and persisting symptoms in sports-related concussion",
      "content": "OBJECTIVE: We investigated longitudinal trajectories of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI), autonomic function, and symptoms after sport-related concussion (SRC). BACKGROUND: Limbic circuitry may be particularly vulnerable to traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could explain the affective and autonomic dysfunction some patients develop. Relatively few studies have performed longitudinal rsfMRI analyses in concussion and fewer have combined imaging with autonomic and symptom data. We leveraged published limbic rsfMRI networks centered on the amygdala that include central autonomic structures in frontal and temporal lobes and their visceromotor targets. We hypothesized that frontoamygdala connectivity would differentiate athletes with SRC from matched, in-sport controls (ISC), predict autonomic function, and predict symptom recovery. DESIGN/METHODS: Using independent-samples t-tests, we compared rsfMRI connectivity strength in amygdala networks in college athletes with SRC (SRC: n=31, female=14) at three time points after concussion (T1[&le;]4 days, T2=10-14 days, T3=60-90 days) and healthy, matched controls without a concussion in the same sport (ISC: n=36, female=17). RESULTS: SRC athletes showed significantly greater frontoamygdala connectivity compared to ISCs at the acute and subacute post-injury time points (T1 p=0.003, T2 p=0.014) that normalized to control-level connectivity by the chronic time point (T3 p=0.182). When testing whether autonomic function interacts with network connectivity trajectory, we found that opposing trajectories of frontoamygdala connectivity between SRC athletes with higher versus lower acute heart rate variability (HRV), as measured by pNN50 (percentage of intervals between successive normal sinus beats greater than 50ms). SRC athletes with higher HRV acutely post-injury had significantly greater acute frontoamygdala connectivity compared to ISCs at T1; connectivity in these high-HRV SRC athletes normalized to control level over time (T1 p=0.001, T2 p=0.055, T3 p=0.576). SRC athletes with lower HRV acutely post-injury had control-level frontoamygdala connectivity at T1; connectivity in these low-HRV SRC athletes significantly exceeded control-level connectivity at T3 (T1 p=0.429, T2 p=0.050, T3 p=0.002). Furthermore, those SRC athletes with the greatest frontoamygdala connectivity at T3, had the most persistent symptoms on the graded symptom checklist at T3 (r=0.635, p=0.001). Differences in diffusion-tensor-imaging-based measures of structural connectivity in the uncinate fasciculus, the fiber bundle most critical to our frontoamygdala network, could not account for these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that increased connectivity in amygdala circuitry acutely after a concussion and its normalization over time may be protective or compensatory; acute measures of amygdala network connectivity and measures of HRV may be valuable biomarkers for predicting symptom persistence.",

      "title": "Presynaptic Actin Nanostructures: A Reproducibility Case Study",
      "content": "In an effort to assess the reproducibility of bioimage analyses in current publications, we took part in a Global BioImage Analysts' Society (GloBIAS) initiative to try and reproduce results from published articles. We attempted to reproduce core findings from the work of Bingham et al., which investigates the actin organisation in presynaptic structures by using diffraction-limited and super-resolution microscopy. While the original paper unveiled clear biological insight, it lacked sufficient detail in the bioimage analysis methodological approach, limiting the depth of reproducibility we could achieve. Through frequent contacts with the corresponding author, we managed to replicate qualitative aspects of the analysis of actin nanostructures in bead-induced presynapses. We performed image reconstruction from super-resolution microscopy data, automatic image registration and visual inspection, followed by manual annotation of structures of interest in ~35 images. Our experience with this exercise highlights the importance of transparent data sharing and accessibility, as well as the need to adhere to bioimage analysis standards that ensure the reproducibility of nowadays complex biological image analysis studies. It also shows how crucial interdisciplinary collaboration is, since many biology labs are simply unaware of these standards, which are often easy to implement and would likely be widely adopted if their value was better understood or known",

      "title": "Telomerase mRNA-Lipid nanoparticles attenuate neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury in mice",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of chronic neurological disability, yet no disease-modifying therapy exists. Emerging evidence indicates that TBI activates cellular aging programs, including telomere erosion and persistent inflammation, that contribute to progressive neurodegeneration. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) preserves telomere homeostasis and provides cytoprotective effects in the central nervous system, but has not been therapeutically targeted after TBI. Here, we developed an mRNA nanotherapy consisting of mouse TERT mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mTERT-LNPs) and evaluated it in a controlled cortical impact model of moderate TBI. We first established that TBI transiently disrupts TERT biology, with reduced cortical TERT mRNA and shortened telomeres at 3 days post-injury (dpi), followed by partial recovery by 14 dpi. mTERT-LNPs were well tolerated in vitro and in vivo. Following intravenous delivery in the acute post-injury window, LNPs localized to the injured brain and displayed expected peripheral biodistribution. A single systemic dose increased cortical TERT mRNA and protein and partially restored telomere length at 3 dpi. TERT mRNA delivery significantly reduced Iba1+ microglial activation and suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines, with modest increases in anti-inflammatory markers. Systemically, mTERT-LNPs lowered serum C-reactive protein and malondialdehyde, indicating reduced peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress, without adverse effects on body weight or peripheral organ histology. Several outcomes showed sex-dependent patterns. Collectively, these data provide the first in vivo evidence that telomerase therapy can modulate telomere biology and neuroinflammation after TBI, supporting mRNA-LNP-mediated TERT restoration as a scalable, mechanistically grounded strategy for disease modification in TBI and related disorders.",

The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "content": "Elucidating the relationship between large-scale and small-scale spatial abilities is fundamental to advancing our understanding of spatial cognition, with training transfer effects across tasks offering a direct means of exploration. This study investigated how large-scale spatial navigation training influences both large- and small-scale spatial abilities and their underlying neural mechanisms. Participants completed 20 days of real-world campus navigation training and performed large-scale (distance judgment) and small-scale (paper folding) spatial tasks before and after training. The training group showed significant improvements in both tasks, whereas the control group did not. Brain imaging revealed increased activation in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) during large-scale task performance after training. In contrast, improvements in the small-scale task were associated with reduced deactivation in the right postcentral gyrus (PoCG), right precuneus, and left superior temporal gyrus (STG). Overall, these findings indicate that large-scale navigation training enhances spatial ability across scales through distinct neural mechanisms, supporting the partial dissociation model and highlighting the contribution of negatively activated regions to spatial processing.",
