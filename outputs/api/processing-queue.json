      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "title": "Dream content and slow waves benefit preys against predators in a video game confrontation",
      "content": "Every studied animal species exhibits some form of sleep, a state evolved under the sustained influence of prey and predator behaviors. Dreams have been proposed to have evolved as offline mental simulations able to warn against impending threats from the environment, such as predators. To assess how the roles of prey and predator interact with sleep and dreaming, we used a first-person shooter game as a proxy for predator-prey confrontations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were recorded from 30 human adults paired and simultaneously recorded while 1) playing a video game round against each other, in which one participant was armed with a gun and the other was not, 2) taking a nap, 3) reporting dreams and/or thoughts, and 4) playing another round with the same gun assignment. We found that the participants in the prey role were highly affected by sleep and dreaming. Their score gains were positively correlated with slow wave activity during the nap, with how much the dreams were related to the game, and with heart rate variability during the first round. In contrast, no significant correlations were found for participants in the predator role. The results suggest that slow wave activity and game-related dream content during sleep improve the post-sleep performance of individuals under stressful, prey-like situations.",

      "title": "Unifying spatial and episodic representations in the hippocampus through flexible memory use",
      "content": "A key question in neuroscience is why the hippocampus is essential for episodic memory in humans, while dominantly exhibiting spatial representations in a number of other species. Some accounts suggest that spatial representation is the primary hippocampal function. Here, we propose that the primary function is storing and retrieving episodic memories, and spatial representations emerge due to this memory function. To demonstrate this, we adopt a computational model that autonomously learns to store information in memory and retrieve it to solve a variety of tasks. In memory tasks, the model develops associations and categorical representations akin to concept cells. In navigation tasks, the model forms representations of the spatial structure, performs geometric computations, and even learns representations of unique events similar to recently discovered barcodes. Our model predicts that the hippocampus represents any task-relevant variable, if the animal learns the task, suggesting that space is not special for the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Chronic delivery of buprenorphine during abstinence decreases incubation of heroin seeking and neuronal activation in medial prefrontal cortex and striatum in male and female rats",
      "content": "Rationale and Objective: Buprenorphine is an FDA-approved medication for opioid addiction, but the brain regions underlying its therapeutic effects remain unknown. We previously found that chronic buprenorphine treatment decreases several relapse-related behaviors in rats. Here, we tested whether chronic buprenorphine decreases the time-dependent increase (incubation) in heroin seeking during abstinence. We also used the activity marker Fos to test whether buprenorphine inhibition of incubation of heroin seeking is associated with decreased activation of cortical and striatal regions. Methods: We trained Oprm1-Cre rats and their wild-type littermates to self-administer heroin for 12 days (6 h/day). On abstinence Day 1, we tested for heroin seeking under extinction conditions. On Day 14, we implanted osmotic minipumps containing saline or buprenorphine (6 mg/kg/day). On abstinence Days 21-22, we tested the rats (or not tested, baseline condition) for incubation of heroin seeking, after which brains were collected for Fos immunohistochemistry. Results: Oprm1-Cre rats did not differ from wild-type littermates in heroin self-administration or non-incubated heroin seeking on abstinence Day 1. In both genotypes, chronic buprenorphine decreased incubated heroin seeking on Days 21-22. Buprenorphine also decreased incubation-related neuronal activation in several cortical areas (anterior cingulate and dorsal peduncular, but not prelimbic, infralimbic, or orbitofrontal cortex) and striatal areas (dorsolateral and dorsomedial striosomes and nucleus accumbens core, but not shell). Conclusions: Chronic buprenorphine decreased incubation of heroin seeking, supporting the predictive validity of the rat model. This effect was associated with decreased neuronal activity in specific subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum.",

      "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Optimization of Perceived Realism of Multi-Modal Haptic Rendering Under Conflicting Sensory Cues",
      "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

      "title": "The Impact of Stimulation Parameters on Reaction Times Following Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation in the Lower Leg",
      "content": "The growing need for human-machine interfaces (HMIs) underscores the importance of sensory feedback, with electrical stimulation offering efficient interaction in various applications. While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

      "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
      "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",
