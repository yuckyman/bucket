      "title": "Longitudinal Changes in Cortical Response Dynamics with Deep Brain Stimulation to the Subcallosal Cingulate for Treatment-Resistant Depression",
      "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) is a promising intervention for treatment-resistant depression, yet objective biomarkers that track recovery remain limited. This study examined longitudinal changes in stimulation-evoked potentials (SEPs) to characterize how SCC-driven cortical communication evolves during treatment. Ten patients across three SCC-DBS trials underwent high-density EEG recordings at 4 and 24 weeks. SEP features were extracted from source-localized SCC signals and related to clinical outcomes and fractional anisotropy (FA) of midcingulate cingulum fibers. Cortical responses showed a consistent reduction in latency and an increase in magnitude over time, indicating faster and stronger electrocortical signaling with chronic stimulation. Higher baseline midcingulate FA predicted greater latency acceleration, linking SEP timing to white-matter integrity. These findings identify temporal SEP dynamics as candidate mechanistic biomarkers that reflect circuit engagement during SCC-DBS and offer a pathway toward physiology-guided optimization of neuromodulation for depression.",

      "content": "<p>I've worked at several companies during the past two decades and I kept encountering the same issues with internal technical proposals:<p>- Authors would change a spec after I started writing code<p>- It's hard to find what proposals would benefit from my review<p>- It's hard to find the right person to review my proposals<p>- It's not always obvious if a proposal has reached consensus (e.g. buried comments)<p>- I'm not notified if a proposal I approved is now ready to be worked on<p>And that's just scratching the surface. The most popular solutions (like Notion or Google Drive + Docs) mostly lack semantics. For example it's easy as a human to see a table in a document with rows representing reviewers and a checkbox representing review acceptance but it's hard to formally extract meaning and prevent a document from \"being published\" when criteria isn't met.<p>RFC Hub aims to solve these issues by building an easy to use interface around all the metadata associated with technical proposals instead of containing it textually within the document itself.<p>The project is still under heavy development as I work on it most nights and weekends. The next big feature I'm planning is proposal templates and the ability to refer to documents as something other than RFCs (Request for Comments). E.g. a company might have a UIRFC for GUI work (User Interface RFCs), a DBADR (Database Architecture Decision Record), etc. And while there's a built-in notification system I'm still working on a Slack integration. Auth works by sending tokens via email but of course RFC Hub needs Google auth.<p>Please let me know what you think!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46109843\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46109843</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Neural Responses Underlying Interaural Time Difference Discrimination as a Function of Sensory Reliability in the Barn Owl",
      "content": "<p>Discrimination of sensory stimuli is fundamentally constrained by the information encoded in neuronal responses. In the barn owl, interaural time difference (ITD) serves as a primary cue for azimuthal sound localization and is represented topographically in the midbrain auditory space map in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). While prior studies have demonstrated a correspondence between spatial tuning and behavioral acuity, it remains unclear how changes in sensory reliability influence this relationship. Here, we examined how behavioral and neuronal ITD discrimination thresholds vary with binaural correlation (BC), which manipulates ITD cue reliability. Using the pupil dilation response as a behavioral metric in head-fixed owls of either sex, we found that ITD just-noticeable differences increased exponentially as BC decreased. In contrast, the widths of ICx ITD tuning curves increased more modestly, indicating that tuning resolution alone does not account for behavioral discrimination performance. By computing the Fisher information from ICx neuronal responses, we showed that the average neuronal discriminability predicts behavioral thresholds across BC values. A habituation-based model incorporating BC-dependent changes in tuning width, firing rate, and response variability successfully accounted for both direction and ITD discrimination. These findings support a model in which perceptual acuity is governed by the combined influence of neuronal tuning and variability and provide a unified framework for understanding how midbrain auditory representations underlie adaptive spatial hearing.</p>",

      "title": "Active Zone Maturation Controls Presynaptic Output and Release Mode and Is Regulated by Neuronal Activity",
      "content": "<p>Synapse formation requires the accumulation of cytomatrix proteins and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) at presynaptic active zones (AZs). At <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larval neuromuscular junctions, a sequential process of AZ maturation is observed, with initial incorporation of early scaffolds followed by arrival of late scaffolds and VGCCs. To examine how AZ maturation regulates presynaptic output, serial imaging of AZ formation and function was performed at time-stamped synapses of male larvae expressing glutamate receptors linked to the photoconvertible protein mMaple. Quantal imaging demonstrated older synapses have higher synaptic efficacy and sustain greater release across development, while immature sites lacking VGCC accumulation supported spontaneous fusion. To examine how activity regulates AZ maturation, the effects of cell autonomous disruptions to neurotransmitter release were analyzed. Decreased synaptic transmission reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of material at existing AZs. Generation of an endogenous photoconvertible version of the AZ scaffold protein BRP revealed neuronal silencing decreased the protein's turnover. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in <i>rab3</i> mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Endogenous tagging of the Unc13B early AZ scaffold and the Unc13A late AZ scaffold revealed activity reduction decreased seeding of both early and late scaffolds, in contrast to <i>rab3</i> mutants. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation regulates presynaptic release mode and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.</p>",
