      "title": "Shaped by meaning, weighted by reliability: New insights into multisensory integration",
      "content": "In everyday perception, sensory information is rarely interpreted in isolation. Instead, observers generate expectations about what is likely to occur next, using contextual information to guide decisions, particularly when sensory input is weak, ambiguous, or uncertain. These expectations can facilitate behaviour when they align with incoming evidence, but impose costs when they conflict, shaping how information from different senses contributes to behaviour. However, it remains unclear what kind of multisensory process is engaged when meaning guides decisions, and whether multisensory facilitation and non-independence reflect a single integrative mechanism or distinct routes shaped by context. Here, we examined how semantic context, visual clarity, and the relationship between auditory and visual signals jointly shape behaviour in a semantic correspondence task using dynamic, naturalistic events. Participants judged whether a target matched a preceding concept prime, establishing an expectation at the level of meaning. Targets were auditory-only, visual-only (clear or blurry), or audiovisual (AV), with AV components conveying either the same or different meanings across modalities. AV facilitation was not a general consequence of stimulus redundancy. When the prime accurately predicted the target and auditory and visual signals conveyed the same meaning, degrading visual input increased the contribution of auditory information, leading to faster responses and violations of the race-model inequality. By contrast, when the prime indicated the target but auditory and visual signals conveyed competing meanings, AV stimulation produced robust behavioural costs relative to vision. When the prime did not match the target, congruent and incongruent audiovisual events produced comparable effects, and race-model violations were observed even when auditory and visual signals encoded different concepts, indicating convergence at the level of the response rather than shared perceptual content. Finally, exploratory clustering revealed two participant subgroups with comparable overall response speed but systematically different multisensory profiles when semantic expectations did not allow reliable anticipation of the upcoming event. Together, these findings show that multisensory effects in semantic decisions are shaped by meaning and arise through two functionally distinct routes: one in which reduced sensory reliability promotes joint use of congruent audiovisual information, and another in which perceptually different signals converge on the same response when semantic expectations are not met.",

      "title": "Zebrin molecular identity and cerebellar location determine Purkinje cell vulnerability in Christianson syndrome mice",
      "content": "Ataxia is a major characteristic feature in Christianson syndrome, where Purkinje cells in the anterior cerebellar vermis are vulnerable to degeneration while those in the posterior vermis are resilient. Here, we provide a temporal study of changes in Purkinje cell function, cell vulnerability and innervation of cerebellar nuclei in a mouse model of Christianson syndrome. Purkinje cells express certain molecules in a patterned manner across the cerebellum, such as aldolase C/zebrin-II (zebrin). We show that zebrin patterning appears normal before disease onset in Christianson syndrome mice with no apparent cell death, similar to what has been reported in patients. We observe rapid Purkinje cell death in the anterior lobe of Christianson syndrome mice that is exclusive to zebrin-negative Purkinje cells, with zebrin-positive Purkinje cells showing resilience. Intrinsic firing deficits exclusively in the anterior cerebellum are observed at the same time as the first observed cell death in the anterior cerebellum. In contrast, posterior Purkinje cells degenerated later, but zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive cells were equally susceptible to degeneration. Purkinje cells' innervation in the cerebellar nuclei was also lost in Christianson syndrome mice in a region-specific manner: neurons in the anterior cerebellar nuclei, with predominantly zebrin-negative Purkinje cells' inputs, displayed dramatic loss of Purkinje cells' innervation, while neurons in the posterior cerebellar nuclei, innervated by both zebrin-negative and zebrin-positive terminals, showed greater resiliency. Together, our results highlight that cerebellar location and zebrin molecular identity appear important to the vulnerability of Purkinje cells and their innervation in the cerebellar nuclei in Christianson syndrome.",

      "title": "HONeD-in on Brain Activity: Deconvolving Passive Diffusion on the Structural Network from Functional Brain Signals",
      "content": "Brain regions perform distinct computations, and their signals propagate through the whole-brain white matter network. Yet, mathematical models that describe this signal propagation via purely passive diffusion can predict a considerable amount of the observed functional connectivity between regions. This raises a critical question: if so much functional connectivity can be explained by a passive process, how can we isolate the active process? Here, we calculate in closed-form an estimate for such an active signal in functional MRI by spatially deconvolving the effect of passive signal spread over the brain's structural connectivity using a higher-order network diffusion (HONeD) model. Across 770 Human Connectome Project subjects, we show that the resulting HONeD-innovation (HONeD-in) signal 1) sparsifies functional connectivity while retaining a well-connected network, 2) remodels resting-state networks (RSNs), 3) mixes the unimodal--multimodal hierarchical organization of RSNs into a circle with no clear hierarchy, and 4) deblurs task-activation maps. Together, our results highlight HONeD deconvolution as a generalizable new way to study resting-state and task fMRI brain signals.",
