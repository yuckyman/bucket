      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I've been using Python for a while now and it's my main language. It is such a wonderful language. Guido had wonderful design choices in forcing whitespace to disallow curly braces and discouraging semicolons so much I almost didn't know they existed. There's even a synonym for beautiful; it's called <em>pythonic</em>.</p> <p>I will probably not use the absolute elephant dung that is NodeJS ever again. Everything that JavaScript has is in Python, but better. And whatever exists in JS but not Python is because it didn't need to exist in Python because it's unnecessary. For example, Flask is like Express but better. I'm not stuck in callback hell or dependency hell.</p> <p>The only cross-device difference I've faced is sys.exit working on Linux but not working on Windows. But in web development, you gotta face vendor prefixes, CSS resets, graceful degradation, some browsers not implementing standards right, etc. Somehow, Python is more cross platform than the web is. Hell, Python even runs on the web.</p> <p>I still love web development though, but writing Python code is just the pinnacle of wonderful computer experiences. This is the same language where you can make a website, a programming language, a video game (3d or 2d), a web scraper, a GUI, etc. </p> <p>Whenever I find myself limited, it is never implementation-wise. It's never because there aren't enough functions. I'm only limited by my (temporary) lack of ideas. Python makes me love programming more than I already did.</p> <p>But C, oh, C is cool but a bit limiting IMO because all the higher level stuff you take for granted like lists and whatever aren't there, and that wastes your time and kind of limits what you can do. C++ kinda solves this with the &lt;vector&gt; module but it is still a hassle implementing stuff compared to Python, where it's very simple to just define a list like [1,2,3] where you can easily add more elements without needing a fixed size. </p> <p>The C and C++ language's limitations make me heavily appreciate what Python does, especially as it is coded in C. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JeffTheMasterr\"> /u/JeffTheMasterr </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qirtk9/i_really_enjoy_python_compared_to_other_coding/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qirtk9/i_really_enjoy_python_compared_to_other_coding/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Effectiveness of transcranial electrical stimulation combined with dual-task training in stroke, mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson\u2019s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
      "content": "AimIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) combined with dual task training (DTT) on physical and cognitive functions in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and stroke disorders.MethodWe conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for English-language literature on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of tDCS, tACS, or tRNS combined with DTT in adults with MCI, PD, and stroke. The search covered studies from the inception of each database up to November 21, 2025. The initial screening of selected articles was conducted independently by two researchers (YLQ and WLW).ResultsA total of twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising individuals with stroke (n\u202f=\u202f4), MCI (n\u202f=\u202f3), and PD (n\u202f=\u202f5). Meta-analysis revealed that active tDCS+DTT yielded no significant overall improvement in global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): SMD\u202f=\u202f0.09, 95% CI [\u22120.49, 0.66], p =\u202f0.77, I2 =\u202f72%). A large, highly homogeneous benefit was observed for executive function (TMT-B: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.33, 95% CI [\u22122.39, \u22120.27], p =\u202f0.01), driven exclusively by the MCI subgroup (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22122.35, 95% CI [\u22123.20, \u22121.51], I2 =\u202f0%). Timed Up and Go cognitive-motor dual-task (TUG CMDT) cadence improved overall (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.58, 95% CI [0.09, 1.08], p =\u202f0.02, I2 =\u202f39%) in both MCI and stroke subgroups. TUG motor dual task (MDT) speed improved modestly (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.42, 95% CI [0.02, 0.83], p =\u202f0.04, I2 =\u202f34%), and CMDT speed showed a strong trend (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.49, p =\u202f0.09), only significant in stroke (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.42, p =\u202f0.002). However, this generalized finding must be nuanced by specific efficacy observed in individual PD studies, which reported significant gains in force-tremor decoupling, postural stability, and CMDT accuracy.ConclusionThe meta-analysis suggests that the effects of tDCS combined with DTT are remarkable in certain populations and for specific outcomes. While substantial improvements are confirmed for executive function and dual-task gait in MCI and stroke, the overall limited efficacy in PD highlights the critical influence of heterogeneity and intervention specificity. Future research should prioritize disease-specific electrode montages and the integration of tACS or tRNS to optimize outcomes across diverse neurological populations.",

      "content": "Cortical folding is a defining feature of human brain development, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms that produce regionally specific cortical folding remain incompletely understood. Here we combined high-resolution in-utero T2-weighted and diffusion MRI atlases (23-38 weeks of gestational age) with prenatal transcriptomic profiles to map regional macrostructural and microstructural features of cortical folding to underlying gene expression. We found genes whose expression patterns correlated with cortical curvature were enriched for neurogenesis, progenitor proliferation and radial glia guided neuronal migration, and localized to ventricular zone/subventricular zone progenitor cell subtypes, supporting for the protomap hypothesis of areal specification. By contrast, cortical microstructural markers-associated gene sets were implicated in myelination, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling, and mapped to astrocyte and endothelial cell programs. The microstructure-related gene expression peaked in the early postnatal period and remained high throughout childhood, while the curvature-associated gene expression reduced with age. Several of these cortical folding-related genes overlapped with autism spectrum disorder risk loci (e.g., SCN2A, STXBP1, DVL3). Collectively, these cross-modal findings outline a sequential developmental architecture--early progenitor driven patterning followed by myelin and extracellular matrix consolidation. In addition, we released a high-resolution fetal labeling atlas to facilitate further imaging-genetic studies of early cortical development.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",
