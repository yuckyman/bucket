      "title": "Measurement of tau protein and A\u03b2 amyloid plaques in postmortem human brains of Down syndrome and Alzheimers disease by using IBETA autoradiography",
      "content": "The accumulation of tau tangles and A{beta} plaques are prominent neuropathologies that characterize Alzheimers disease (AD) and Down Syndrome (DS). Continuous developments of PET tracers as biomarkers can be supported by autoradiography to validate effectiveness and accuracy of binding properties that elucidate the pathophysiology of DSAD and AD. This in vitro comparative study evaluates [125I]IPPI binding to tau and [125I]IBETA binding to A{beta} plaques in the frontal cortex (FCX) and temporal cortex (TCX) of postmortem human brain slices of AD (n=5), DSAD (n=5), and cognitively normal (CN) (n=5) cases. With anti-tau and anti-A{beta} immunostains confirming the presence of tau and A{beta} plaques, [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding in autoradiographic images were significantly higher in DSAD and AD gray matter (GM) compared to CN. When comparing DSAD with AD, FCX and TCX GM binding was similar throughout DSAD and AD except in FCX GM where there was 48% more [125I]IPPI binding in DSAD than AD. In vitro drug inhibition studies revealed that [125I]IPPI binding was significantly inhibited with increasing harmine concentrations (IC50=115{+/-}40 nM) in DSAD FCX and TCX but KuFal194 minimally inhibited [125I]IPPI binding in the same cases. The GM/white matter ratios for DSAD ([125I]IPPI=4.1, [125I]IBETA=2.9) and AD ([125I]IPPI=4.2, [125I]IBETA=2.6) were significantly greater than CN ([125I]IPPI=1.3, [125I]IBETA=1.2). A positive correlation between [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding suggests a synergistic relationship between tau and A{beta} plaque in DSAD and AD pathology. This study demonstrates that [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA may serve as novel radiotracers in both DSAD and AD to continue diagnostic investigations in vivo.",

      "title": "The core herpes simplex-1 fusion complex drives cell-to-cell spreading of pathological Tau",
      "content": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by the pathological aggregation of the host-encoded protein Tau into amyloid fibrils. Pathologic protein aggregates composed of Tau are able to spread from cell-to-cell, thereby contributing to disease progression. The exact mechanisms of intercellular dissemination remain ill-defined. Mounting evidence links the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) to the aetiology of AD. HSV-1 is a prevalent neurotropic virus that replicates in epithelial cells at the site of infection, and subsequently establishes lifelong latency in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In the quiescent latent state, AD brains show elevated expression of structural viral proteins in the absence of virus production. We hypothesized that HSV-1 glycoproteins involved in viral attachment and fusion facilitate the intercellular spreading of proteopathic seeds. Using cellular models, we demonstrate that expression of the HSV-1 core fusion complex, essential for viral entry and direct cell-to-cell transmission, is sufficient to promote aggregate dissemination between cells. Moreover, anti-HSV-1 antibodies present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HSV-1 encephalitis efficiently neutralize viral infection, block viral cell-to-cell transmission, and inhibit propagation of pathological Tau. Thus, latent HSV-1 infection of the brain could contribute to neurodegenerative disease progression, and antiviral antibodies may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.",

      "title": "Show HN: Grov \u2013 Multiplayer for AI coding agents",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Tony.<p>I built Grov (<a href=\"https://grov.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://grov.dev/</a>) because I hit a wall with current AI coding assistants: they are \"single-player.\" The moment I kill a terminal pane or close a chat session, the high-level reasoning and architectural decisions generated during that session are lost. If a teammate touches that same code an hour later, their agent has to re-derive everything from scratch or read many documentation files for basically any feature implemented or bug fixed.<p>I wanted to stop writing a lot of docs for everything just to give context to my agents or have to re-explain to my agents what my teammate did and why.<p>Grov is an open-source context layer that effectively gives your team's AI agents a shared, persistent memory.<p>Here is the technical approach:<p>1. Decision-grain memory, not document storage: When you sync a memory, Grov structures knowledge at the decision level. We capture the specific aspect (e.g., \"Auth Strategy\"), the choice made (\"JWT\"), and the reasoning (\"Stateless for scaling\"). Crucially, when your codebase evolves, we don't overwrite memories, we mark old decisions as superseded and link them to the new choice. This gives your team an audit trail of architectural evolution, not just the current snapshot.<p>2. Git-like branches for memories: Teams experimenting with different approaches can create memory branches. Memories on a feature branch stay isolated until you are ready to merge. Access control mirrors Git: main is team-wide, while feature branches keep noise isolated. When you merge the branch, those accumulated insights become instantly available to everyone's agents.<p>3. Two-stage injection (Token Optimization): The expensive part of shared memory isn't storage it's the context window. Loading 10 irrelevant memories wastes tokens and confuses the model. Grov uses a \"Preview \u2192 Expand\" strategy:\n Preview: A hybrid semantic/keyword search returns lightweight memory summaries (~100 tokens). \n Expand: The full reasoning traces (~500-1k tokens) are only injected if the agent explicitly requests more detail. This typically results in a 50-70% token reduction per session compared to raw context dumping.<p>The result: Your teammate's agent doesn't waste 5 minutes re-exploring why you chose Postgres over Redis, or re-reading auth middleware. It just knows, because your agent already figured it out and shared it.<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/TonyStef/Grov\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/TonyStef/Grov</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711958\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711958</a></p>\n<p>Points: 12</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>",

      "title": "The Vesicular Glutamate Transporter Modulates Sex and Region-Specific Differences in Dopaminergic Neuron \u03b1-Synuclein Toxicity by Modifying Cytosolic Dopamine Levels",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease disproportionately affects males; however, the cause of this sex difference is unknown. We found that expressing mutant -synuclein A53T in Drosophila dopamine neurons recapitulates the sex differences observed in human Parkinson's disease patients. Male flies exhibited greater age-related motor impairment and more severe dopamine neuron degeneration than females. Selective masculinization of female dopamine neurons via knockdown of the sex determination gene Transformer eliminated the observed sex differences in locomotor ability and neurodegeneration by increasing the severity of motor defects and degeneration in females. Transformer knockdown in dopamine neurons also reduced total vesicular glutamate transporter staining in the brain. Direct knockdown of the vesicular glutamate transporter in female dopamine neurons expressing -synuclein A53T exacerbated motor dysfunction, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and accelerated dopamine neuron degeneration. Increasing cytosolic dopamine via knockdown of the vesicular monoamine transporter or increasing total dopamine levels via levodopa treatment phenocopied vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown; furthermore, reducing total dopamine via alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine treatment protected against vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown. These results support a model in which lower VGLUT levels in dopamine neurons result in higher levels of cytosolic dopamine, which leads to dopamine mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to -synuclein A53T toxicity.",
