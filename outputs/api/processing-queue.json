      "title": "Cortical beta coherence provides a stronger non-invasive predictor of movement vigor than local beta power",
      "content": "Background: Movement elicits a robust decrease in motor cortical beta-band ({beta} ; 13-30 Hz) power contralateral to the moving limb. On this basis, studies have targeted contralateral motor cortical {beta} power to decode or modulate movement vigor (initiation and execution speed) non-invasively. Yet, reported behavioral effects and decoding accuracy remain modest. Considering that controlling vigor involves distributed brain regions, network-level metrics that capture interactions between cortical regions may track changes in vigor more accurately than local power. We therefore tested whether {beta} cortico-cortical coherence, measured as functional connectivity between contralateral motor cortex and other cortical areas, predicts movement vigor more reliably than {beta} power. Methods: Thirty healthy participants performed right hand opening at two instructed speeds (Fast, Slow), while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. EEG data were source-localized, and analyses were conducted at the sensor and source levels. We compared {beta} power and {beta} coherence in their ability to discriminate Fast from Slow condition. Effects were assessed across the whole scalp/cortex and using subject-specific selections of electrodes/parcels optimized for discrimination. Results: Fast trials exhibited shorter movement time (MT) and reaction time (RT) than Slow trials, indicating higher vigor. No electrodes cluster showed any significant {beta} power difference between Fast and Slow conditions. With subject-specific channel selection, {beta} power discriminated vigor above chance in most participants, but the polarity of the {beta} power contrast (Fast < Slow or Fast > Slow) varied across individuals. In contrast, with subject-specific parcel selection, {beta} coherence was consistently reduced during Fast relative to Slow in the majority of participants. Across participants, lower {beta} coherence, but not {beta} power, was significantly associated with larger Slow-Fast vigor difference. Conclusions: {beta} cortico-cortical coherence between contralateral motor cortex and other cortical regions provided a more robust and consistent predictor of movement vigor than contralateral motor cortical {beta} power. {beta} coherence exhibited a sustained reduction during fast movements across trials and participants, supporting its use as target for non-invasive neuromodulation of vigor and as feature for decoding intended movement speed.",

      "title": "Modeling the Memory of Unmyelinated Axons: Integration of a Data-Driven Approach with Physiological Memory Concept",
      "content": "In this study, we present a simplified and resource-efficient computational model to predict activity-dependent conduction velocity changes of action in unmyelinated axons. This model serves as a complementary tool to Hodgkin-Huxley models. Our approach is based on the concept of \"memory,\" where the speed of subsequent action potentials is modulated by prior activity. We utilized microneurography data from 95 mechano-insensitive C-fibers of healthy human participants, including both sexes, across various stimulation protocols to optimize model parameters. The model incorporates linear long-term and non-linear short-term memory components. By convolving the history of recorded action potentials with the memory function, the model can effectively predict the propagation speed of subsequent action potentials with low mean squared errors for the proposed one-dimensional and two-dimensional memory functions. This computational framework provides insights into the dynamics of unmyelinated axons under varying conditions and thus in signal processing along the axon and the short-term memory of axons. The model's rapid computation times make it suitable for real-time applications in electrophysiological experiments.",

      "title": "A lightweight, physics-based, sensor-fusion filter for real-time EEGdenoising and improved downstream AI classification",
      "content": "Physiological time-series data, like electroencephalography (EEG), are vulnerable to motion, ocular, and muscle artifacts that hinder real-time inference and bias offline analyses. We present the Minds AI Filter: a lightweight, physics-based, sensor-fusion method that exploits multichannel spatial structure and band-aware synchrony to enhance neural activity while suppressing non- neural noise. The nomenclature \"AI\" reflects integration within a larger artificial-intelligence pipeline; the filter itself requires no prior training or deep learning. A single tuning parameter controls filter strength. The design supports streaming windows (approx. 1s) with minimal added latency and extends naturally to longer offline segments; leveraging a sensor-fusion design across channels, it suggests applicability to other neurophysiological time-series, such as MEG and ECoG, pending further validation; exploratory incorporation of EOG/ECG as auxiliary signals is a potential avenue for future filter advancements. We evaluate the approach across multiple devices and public datasets, assessing both down- stream AI classification performance and real-time signal-quality metrics. In both real-time and offline settings, the filter performed better on dynamic artifacts and noise than baseline and commonly used alternatives in our evaluations. When applied in conjunction with other methods, it was only observed to improve downstream accuracy, never reduce it, when any effect was present. Denoising is quantified using SNR-like measures, and ablations isolate the roles of spatial coupling and band weighting. Artifact-specific analyses (ocular bursts, head tilt, jaw clench) and latency profiling on commodity hardware are included. These results indicate that a lightweight, synchrony-aware filter can robustly stabilize real-time EEG and systematically improve downstream AI classification. The method is compatible with standard preprocessing but does not depend on it.",

      "content": "Natural vision is an active, predictive process guided by expectations about when and where information will appear. Yet how gaze is shaped in dynamic, multisensory environments remains poorly understood. Using immersive virtual reality with eye-tracking, we examined oculomotor behavior during naturalistic navigation. Participants cycled through a virtual city while avatar cyclists, first heard as overtaking them from behind via spatialized auditory cues, later became visible as they passed. Auditory cues triggered anticipatory gaze shifts to expected locations, indicating that eye movements were guided by auditory predictions rather than reactive visual responses. Violations of auditory-spatial expectations elicited longer fixations. Critically, removing auditory cues impaired predictive gaze orienting, delayed gaze orienting and increased collisions with obstacles. These findings demonstrate that auditory input fundamentally shapes predictive models guiding visual exploration and adaptive behavior in dynamic environments, underscoring the multisensory basis of active perception in real-world interactions.",

      "title": "Amphisome biogenesis couples synaptic autophagy to local protein synthesis",
      "content": "Summary Amphisomes are hybrid organelles that result from fusion of late endosomes with autophagosomes. Here, we report that amphisomes containing BDNF/TrkB and capable of signaling are formed at presynaptic boutons following high-frequency stimulation. Activity dependent bulk-endocytosis serves as a membrane source and autophagy initiation is induced by the energy-sensing enzyme AMPK. Intense neuronal transmission not only induces high membrane exchange and metabolic demands, but it also causes the remodeling of presynaptic molecular composition. We show that formation of BDNF/TrkB signaling amphisomes contribute to the fast turnover of key presynaptic proteins that constitute the synaptic vesicle cluster. Following sustained synaptic activity newly-formed amphisomes enable their degradation as cargo on the one hand and their replenishment by translation of mRNA localized at synaptic boutons on the other. We propose that activity-induced synaptic autophagy to a large degree represents amphisome formation that in turn is required to replace cytomatrix proteins at presynaptic sites.",

      "title": "Development of a Human iPSC-Derived \"Corticospinal Tract-on-a-Chip\" for Neurodegenerative Disease Research",
      "content": "Degeneration of the corticospinal tract is a central feature in a number of neurodegenerative disorders and leads to significant disability. However, modeling corticospinal neuron (CSN) pathology and corticospinal connectivity in neurological disorders is particularly challenging. While rodent models are important for understanding early degeneration of CSN, interspecies differences in corticospinal connectivity and challenges of in vivo study suggest that human in vitro models of corticospinal biology may be ripe for development. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) are promising tools for overcoming intrinsic limitations that arise from physiological differences between rodents and humans. We have developed an innovative hiPSC-based microfluidic platform for modeling human CSN and spinal motor neuron (SpMN) connectivity. The incorporation of regionally specific astrocyte subtypes (cortical and spinal) in addition to CSNs and SpMNs in this newly designed system allows for the modeling of both regional and neural cell-subtype interactions. Using this model, multielectrode array electrophysiology reveals the maturation of both cortical and spinal motor neurons over the time course of 12 weeks. Retrograde labeling methods demonstrate synaptic connectivity between corticospinal and spinal motor neurons. Optogenetic strategies to selectively activate excitatory CNs attenuated by glutamate receptor antagonism confirms the functional relevance of the model. Incorporating morphological, electrophysiological and physiological measures of corticospinal connectivity, this platform is a versatile model for use in neurodegenerative disease research and for the future development of targeted CSN therapies.",

      "title": "Neurodegeneration Associated with Repeated High-Frequency Transcranial Focused Ultrasound",
      "content": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS) is a popular tool for non-invasive neuromodulation which prior testing paradigms have suggested is benign. However, emerging use cases such as clinical therapies and brain-machine interfaces will likely require repeated or long-duration exposures with novel combinations of stimulus parameters (e.g., frequency, focal volume), and the safety of these conditions has not yet been rigorously validated. Therefore, as an initial study we delivered 1.8 MHz tFUS stimulation to the cortex of 4 non-human primates in 4 sessions each of approximately 90 min over 2 weeks. Motor skills were measured daily with a food pellet picking task. Animals were euthanized and the brain sections were processed for histological markers of neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade C). While the animals did not show disruption on the behavioral task, there was clear evidence of neurodegeneration in regions associated with short, intermediate, and extended-duration stimulation, but not with unstimulated control tissues in deeper brain areas. Additional neurodegeneration was observed at locations distant from but functionally connected to stimulated regions, consistent with retrograde damage propagated from neuron processes. We discuss alternative causes for the neurodegeneration, and we recommend the use of additional animal studies to understand this phenomenon, especially for novel stimulation paradigms or parameters and applications where extended or repeated exposures are planned.",

      "content": "The output mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) of the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) are coupled through both chemical mechanisms as well as gap junctions that are mediated by connexin 36 (Cx36). Here we tested both behavioral and physiological effects of eliminating gap junctions in knockout (KO) mice with homozygous deletions of Cx36. In a go/no-go associative learning task, Cx36 KO mice were found to display reduced discrimination capabilities when presented with pairs of stimuli that included a monomolecular odor and mixtures that had the same monomolecular odor and a small amount of a structurally similar odor. The impairments did not occur for less similar odor pairs, suggesting that Cx36 KO mice have olfactory processing deficits that are specific to fine odor discrimination. In physiological recordings in OB slices from Cx36 KO mice, MCs displayed reduced excitation in response to electrical stimulation of sensory afferents, both single stimulus pulses as well as a theta burst pattern designed to mimic sniffing. The reduction in MC excitatory current was most prominent for late portions of their response, 300 ms after single stimulus pulses or following all theta bursts that came after the first. More global local field potentials recorded in OB glomeruli were largely unaffected by Cx36 KO. We suggest that the KO-induced impairments in fine odor discrimination are linked to reduced late MC excitation due to the longer time that mice require to make difficult odor discriminations.",

      "title": "Speed-dependent modulation of tactile edge orientation discrimination",
      "content": "Previous studies investigating edge-orientation discrimination capacity either stimulated an immobilized finger at limited speeds, or did not manipulate movement speed during active exploration. Here we tested the effect of movement speed on edge-orientation discrimination, including very slow and fast speeds. Participants were instructed to move their finger across two pairs of edges while matching their speed to a visual cue. One edge pair was parallel and the other non parallel to varying degrees. Participants were asked to identify the non parallel pair of edges. We report three main findings. First, consistent with previous reports, when they were free to choose their movement speed, participants moved at an average speed of ~29 mm/s (range: 15-52 mm/s). Second, there was no correlation between a participant's natural speed and their edge orientation discrimination capacity. Third, participants got better at edge orientation discrimination at slower than average speeds (5mm/s), and worse at higher than average speeds (90 and 180 mm/s). This change in performance was correlated with their relative change in movement speed.",

      "title": "Mapping the molecular landscape of the living brain: integrating spatial transcriptomics and qMRI",
      "content": "Disease modifying therapies targeting specific molecular disease processes are becoming increasingly available for neurodegenerative disorders. However, profiling molecular features of neurodegeneration in living patients is challenging due to limited accessibility to brain tissue. In this work, we demonstrate that we can infer cell type presence and expression of molecular pathways at a sub-cortical level from ultra-high resolution 7T quantitative MRI by leveraging in-depth molecular characterisation of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to characterising disease by predicting molecular features in a Parkinson's disease cohort. From qMRI data we predict disruption to the distribution of oligodendrocytes in the grey-matter cortex consistent with altered oligodendrocyte maturation. Our method contributes to advancing precision medicine in neurodegeneration, with promising attributes including cost-effectiveness, tolerability and clinical accessibility, with potential for clinical impact.",
