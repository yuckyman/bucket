      "title": "Neural correlation between swallowing motor imagery and execution: an EEG analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The relationship between swallowing motor imagery (MI) and actual swallowing remains unclear, leading to a lack of physiological basis for the application of swallowing imagery-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) paradigms in rehabilitation. This research explored the link between swallowing execution and imagery, aiming to optimize BCI applications for swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia. Approach. Thirty healthy participants performed swallowing MI and saliva swallowing tasks under video cues, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 64 channels and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the suprahyoid muscles were recorded. This study investigates swallowing onset detection using EMG, and explores neural dynamics during swallowing imagery and execution through EEG-based time\u2013frequency analysis, functional connectivity analysis, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (sample entropy (SampEn)). Main Results. The results revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the central region (CPz, CP1\u2013CP4) and parietal region (Pz, P1\u2013P4) for both swallowing MI and actual swallowing. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0102). The ERD phenomenon during swallowing imagery was more similar to that during the pharyngeal stage, with a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0139). Functional connectivity analysis revealed greater activation of the central region during swallowing imagery than during actual swallowing. In terms of SampEn, swallowing motor execution exhibited higher signal complexity and dynamic characteristics compared to imagery. Significance. This study highlights the similarity in neural activation between swallowing imagery and execution, particularly in the central and parietal regions, supporting the application of the swallowing imagery paradigm in these regions for rehabilitation. Further research is required to enhance BCI applications in swallowing disorders.",

      "content": "Aging is the major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease, yet the mechanisms linking physiological aging to brain dysfunction remain unclear. Because telomere erosion is a hallmark of aging, we examined its impact on glial and neuronal physiology. Telomere shortened mice showed lipofuscinosis, hypomyelination, microglial atrophy, and cognitive deficits. Single nuclei RNA-seq revealed accelerated glial aging, elevated microglial senescence pathways, and impaired oligodendrocyte functions. Inducing senescence in human iPSC derived microglia with shortened telomeres identified soluble DLK1 as a novel senescence associated ligand. sDLK1 was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of telomere shortened and naturally aged mice, and this increase was eliminated by microglial depletion. AAV delivery of sDLK1 in vivo caused hypomyelination and blocked oligodendrocyte lineage progression, demonstrating the detrimental nature of excessive sDLK1. In human iPSC systems, sDLK1 impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and altered calcium signaling in excitatory neurons. These findings identify microglial senescence as a core consequence of telomere shortening and reveal sDLK1 as a microglia-derived senescence ligand that drives oligodendrocyte and neuronal dysfunction in aging.",

      "content": "The serotonergic psychedelic, psilocybin, shows potential for rapid and sustained antidepressant effects but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using a chronic interferon-alpha-induced rat model of depression, we show acute psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) reverses impaired reward-induced biases within 24hrs, with effects enduring for at least 7 days. This suggests psilocybin can restore blunted reward processing, an effect which could significantly contribute to its sustained antidepressant effects.",

      "title": "Astrocyte stimulation reopens the window of the critical period for the experience-dependent plasticity of retinogeniculate synapses",
      "content": "A specific time window during which neural circuits undergo dramatic changes in response to individual experiences is known as the critical period (CP). Developing methods to reopen the CP after its closure could lead to the establishment of effective treatment approaches. The retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) undergo experience-dependent remodeling only during the limited period of development. We investigated the effects of astrocyte manipulation on the restoration of RG synapse plasticity after the CP termination. Astrocytic stimulation with the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) after the CP closure caused RG synapse remodeling in the dark-reared mice but not in those reared in normal conditions. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of dLGN astrocytes implicated the underlying mechanisms of astrocyte-induced RG synaptic plasticity. Therefore, astrocytes can regulate the susceptibility of RG synapses to experience-dependent plasticity after CP termination.",

      "title": "SnapG: An Automated Tool for Myelin g-ratio Measurement with Batch Processing Capability",
      "content": "The g-ratio, calculated as the axon diameter divided by the total myelinated fiber diameter, is widely used to assess the degree of myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Changes in g-ratios accompany demyelinating, hypomyelinating, and remyelinating conditions, and can also result from activity-dependent, adaptive myelination. Although manual tracing from electron micrographs has been the gold-standard to measure g-ratios, this process is laborious and limits throughput. To address this challenge, we developed SnapG, an automated and user friendly software tool to streamline g-ratio analysis from electron micrographs. SnapG implements an end to end pipeline for axon and myelin segmentation on EM images. The tool integrates robust segmentation and post processing steps to extract axon and fiber diameters and generates both per image and cohort level summary statistics. SnapG produces g-ratio distributions that agree well with expert manual annotations and established tools across imaging modalities. It reduces user intervention, supports large image and batch processing, and achieves faster processing times while delivering accurate, reproducible measurements. SnapG's automated reporting thereby facilitates high throughput analyses and improves consistency across experiments. SnapG can accelerate studies of myelin biology and provides a practical alternative to existing tools.",
