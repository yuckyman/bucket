      "title": "The effect of development on cortical auditory evoked potentials in normal hearing listeners and cochlear implant users",
      "content": "IntroductionCortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs), such as the P1-N1-P2 complex (onset response) and the acoustic change complex (ACC), provide insight into sound detection and discrimination. While their developmental trajectories are well documented in normal-hearing (NH) listeners, less is known about how these responses develop in pediatric cochlear implant (CI) users and how they are affected by background noise.MethodsCAEPs were recorded in quiet and +10 dB SNR noise conditions using long-duration vowel stimuli from 91 children and 11 adults with NH and 59 CI users (48 pre-lingually deafened children/young adults and 11 post-lingually deafened adults). Peak latencies (P1, N1, P2) and N1-P2 amplitudes were measured. Developmental effects were analyzed using linear regression, t-tests, and correlation analyses comparing child and adult waveforms.ResultsBoth onset and ACC responses were present across groups, with P1 latency decreasing significantly with age in NH and CI listeners. The ACC followed a similar developmental trajectory as the onset response but matured later, emerging reliably in adolescence. Noise delayed maturation, lengthened latencies, and reduced amplitudes, particularly for the ACC. CI users implanted before 3.5 years showed developmental patterns comparable to NH peers, though both onset and ACC responses were more affected by noise in CI users.Discussion/ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that early implantation supports the typical development of cortical auditory responses, underscoring the importance of neuroplasticity in pediatric CI users. However, the pronounced vulnerability of the ACC to noise highlights ongoing challenges in sound discrimination for CI users. CAEPs, especially ACC measures, may serve as objective markers of auditory maturation and could complement behavioral assessments in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Prognostic value of quantitative and visual electroencephalography in disorders of consciousness: a retrospective study",
      "content": "BackgroundElectroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to assess prognosis in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Visual assessments by physicians and quantitative EEG (qEEG) are commonly used; however, only a few studies have directly compared their predictive accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the prognostic value of visual EEG classification versus that of qEEG-based spectral analysis for survival and neurological outcomes in patients with impaired consciousness.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we examined 97 patients with impaired consciousness admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Fukushima Medical University Hospital between April 2018 and December 2023. Visual EEG grading was performed using a conventional grading system based on established criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare predictive performance. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed incorporating qEEG and clinical prognostic factors (Scarpino score, rehabilitation status, and age). The incremental predictive value of clinical variables was assessed using DeLong\u2019s test.ResultsVisual EEG assessment showed moderate predictive accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77 for survival; 0.677\u20130.725 for neurological outcomes]. qEEG-based models showed comparable performance to visual EEG classification, with slightly higher AUC values that were not statistically significant. The addition of clinical factors significantly improved predictive accuracy, particularly for neurological recovery (AUC improved from 0.729 to 0.936; P < 0.001).ConclusionCombining qEEG features and clinical prognostic factors provided a comprehensive approach for outcome prediction in patients with DoC. These findings support the potential of a multimodal prognostic framework integrating objective EEG metrics and physician-derived evaluations, although further prospective validation is required.",
