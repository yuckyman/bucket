      "content": "Epilepsy often becomes treatment-resistant, partly due to impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function. Enhancing inhibitory neuron activity via gene therapy may restore excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We developed a compact 410-bp glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter (cmGAD67) that enables strong, selective transgene expression in inhibitory neurons while preserving AAV packaging capacity. When delivered systemically, AAV vectors carrying cmGAD67 preferentially targeted parvalbumin interneurons and supported effective circuit manipulation. To evaluate therapeutic potential, we expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) under cmGAD67 (AAV-GAD65) in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) epilepsy models. Systemic AAV-GAD65 suppressed abnormal delta oscillations, reduced seizure-like events, normalized anxiety-like behavior, and improved survival in a severe PTZ paradigm. Biochemical analyses confirmed increased cortical and hippocampal GABA levels, linking behavioral and electrophysiological improvements to enhanced inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis. Prior clinical evidence indicates that AAV-GAD65 delivery to the subthalamic nucleus is safe and effective in Parkinson's disease. Building on this foundation, our findings establish the cmGAD67 promoter as a powerful platform for inhibitory neuron-targeted AAV gene therapy and highlight AAV-cmGAD67-GAD65 as a promising approach for treatment-resistant epilepsy and other disorders involving disrupted E/I balance.",

      "title": "Normative modeling of brain morphology reveals neuroanatomical heterogeneity and biological subtypes in major depressive disorder",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by high neurobiological heterogeneity, which hinders precise diagnosis and treatment. Traditional group-level neuroimaging analyses fail to capture individual differences, while normative modeling offer a promising approach to quantify individual deviations from healthy brain structure patterns, facilitating the identification of biological subtypes and offering a data-driven framework to dissect this heterogeneity. METHODS: Using 1,190 healthy controls (age 22-37), we constructed normative developmental trajectories of gray matter volume (GMV) across 246 Brainnetomedefined regions using Bayesian linear regression. Deviation maps were derived for 398 MDD patients. k-means clustering was employed to identify GMV-based biotypes. Then, the clinical characteristics and anatomical differences among these subtypes were explored, along with the post-treatment clinical features and treatment responses of participants who completed the 8-week antidepressant treatment within each subtype. RESULTS: Patients with MDD exhibited widespread yet individually variable GMV deviations. Clustering analysis revealed two subtypes: Subtype 1 displayed predominantly negative deviations in sensorimotor and occipital cortices, whereas Subtype 2 showed widespread positive deviations in temporal and posterior cingulate regions. Subtype 1 had higher extraversion and symptom-linked deviation patterns; in Subtype 2, deviation burden correlated with generalized anxiety. Longitudinally, Subtype 1's GMV deviation changes predicted symptom improvement, while Subtype 2's deviations correlated with baseline severity. CONCLUSIONS: Normative modeling of GMV reveals marked neuroanatomical heterogeneity in MDD and identifies subtypes with distinct clinical and treatment-related characteristics, laying a foundation for precision psychiatry and individualized interventions.",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Morphometric Latent Factors in Autism and Their Association with Receptor Profiles and Behavior",
      "content": "The profound heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a major barrier to developing targeted therapies. While dimensional subtyping using functional connectivity (FC) has advanced the field, the intrinsic instability of FC limits its power to identify stable trait-like biomarkers. This study provides a direct comparison of latent factors derived from both FC and a stable morphometric measure, Morphometric Inverse Divergence (MIND), within the same ASD cohort. We hypothesized that stable structural factors would provide a more behaviorally relevant and biologically grounded account of ASD heterogeneity. Our findings reveal an important dissociation between functional and morphometric features. Latent factors derived from morphometric similarity (MIND) significantly correlated with core ASD behavioral traits (SCQ, SRS), while functional factors showed no association. This dissociation was also found at the neural level. Specifically, we observed weaker structure-function correspondence in the ASD group compared to the healthy control group (HC). Moreover, the stable structural factors were linked to trait-like neurodevelopmental mechanisms: the association with the CB1 receptor (important for synaptic pruning) observed in the HC was notably missing in the ASD group. Conversely, the functional factors were associated with a state-like arousal system (the norepinephrine transporter, NET). Collectively, our results demonstrate that stable morphometric-based factors, rather than time-varying functional ones, are predictive of behavioral traits in ASD. This work validates MIND as a robust approach and suggests that the link between structural organization and its neurodevelopmental (CB1) underpinnings is a more powerful and stable target for developing biomarkers in autism.",

      "title": "Traumatic Conditioning Induces a Combination of Anesthesia Resistant Memory and Protein Synthesis Dependent Long-Term Memory in Adult Drosophila",
      "content": "Stressful experiences elicit long-lasting memory trace that often persists for life-time. Though storage of experience dependent memory is key to survival, post-traumatic memories are detrimental to the physical and emotional wellbeing. The generation of any form of long-term memory culminates from synaptic plasticity and potentiation through persistent change in protein synthesis. Drosophila has been a robust model for the study of memory mechanisms; olfactory memory paradigms have been enormously successful in elucidating neuroanatomical, molecular, physiological and signalling pathways underlying the process. Long-term memory (LTM) has been induced by protein synthesis dependent mechanisms followed by a post-learning consolidation process whereas a medium-term anaesthesia resistant memory (ARM) is mediated by the Radish protein in flies. Here we present a novel and simple memory paradigm in adult flies for inducing sustained stress-induced memory paradigm, where a single attractive odorant is associated with an aversive stimulus- copper sulfate, which provides bitter taste as well as sustained malaise due to toxicity. We find that the elicited memory is a combination of ARM and LTM which is dependent on the number of training cycles. The eight-cycle training paradigm leads to robust, CREB and protein synthesis dependent memory persisting for about 7 days. The mushroom body (MB) Kenyon cells neurons as well as the dopaminergic input neurons (PPL1 subset) are involved in the formation of memory mediated by enhanced calcium as well as synaptic elaboration in the {gamma} subset of the MB neurons.",

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
