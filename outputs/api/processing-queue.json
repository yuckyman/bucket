      "title": "What are the virtual reality solutions for dual-task intervention to promote health in aging? A scoping review",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive-motor dual-task (CMDT) performance is crucial for everyday activities, particularly in older adults who commonly experience deficiencies in cognitive and motor domains. These impairments compromise daily functioning, causing a decrease in quality of life. However, traditional assessment and training methods face significant limitations. Conventional protocols often exhibit limited ecological validity, as they fail to replicate real-world performance demands adequately. Moreover, they are characterized by substantial methodological heterogeneity and offer restricted capacity for real-time performance monitoring and the delivery of personalized feedback. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a promising approach by creating controlled, real-life environments that enable precise assessment and personalized training. However, VR-based CMDT remains largely unexplored. This review evaluates current VR solutions for CMDT, examining assessment, and intervention designs.MethodsA scoping review was conducted on April 17, 2023 (and updated on January 21, 2025), following the PRISMA for Scoping Review guidelines, on three databases: Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed. We included original articles, based on the following criteria: English-language; original research articles reporting empirical data from experimental, quasi-experimental, or observational studies; articles employing CMDT assessment or training; use of VR-based applications during a CMDT; older population participants (\u226565 years). Reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, conceptual articles, case studies, and short papers were excluded.ResultsOf 2,649 papers, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 assessment and four training studies. Research focused on healthy older adults and individuals with early cognitive decline, sensory deficits, and those at fall risk. Assessment studies mainly employed immersive and semi-immersive systems simulating realistic scenarios in virtual environments, primarily using \u201cwalking while\u201d paradigms with cognitive tasks. Training studies frequently utilized non-immersive or semi-immersive solutions with less naturalistic environments, demonstrating improvements in gait parameters, dual-task performance, motor functions, and cognitive abilities. Substantial methodological heterogeneity was observed in intervention duration, frequency, and DT cost calculations, with limited attention to user experience evaluation.DiscussionVR-based CMDT applications show promise for assessment and intervention in aging. However, significant gaps exist regarding the lack of standardized methodological approaches, ecological validity, and user-centered design considerations. Future research should address these limitations to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of VR-based CMDT interventions.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo compare demographics, comorbidities, neurologic symptoms, quality of life, and cognitive outcomes among adult individuals with neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) across countries with varying income levels: the United States (U.S.), Colombia, Nigeria, and India.MethodsIn this multi-country observational study, participants were evaluated in hospital clinics and recruited from institutional databases between 2020 and 2025. Patients were categorized as post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) or non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP). Cognitive assessments were performed using the NIH Toolbox (U.S. and Colombia), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nigeria), or the Mini-Mental State Examination (India).ResultsA total of 3,157 participants were enrolled (652 PNP; 2,505 NNP). PNP patients were predominantly male except in the US, while NNP patients were predominantly female, except in India. The most frequent neurologic symptoms were brain fog, myalgia, dizziness, headache, and sensory disturbances, with frequency highest in the U.S. and lowest in India. There were significant differences for most neurologic and non-neurologic symptoms of PASC, driven by higher frequencies in U.S. and Colombia in both PNP and NNP cohorts. In addition, cognitive impairment measured with different instruments varied across countries for both PNP and NNP groups. Multiple correspondence analysis showed clustering of symptom burden between U.S./Colombia and Nigeria/India.ConclusionNeuro-PASC presents globally but symptom burden, and psychological distress vary across regions, likely influenced by sociocultural factors, healthcare access, and diagnostic tools. These findings highlight the need for culturally-adapted screening and post-COVID care worldwide.",

      "content": "Auditory perception and localization are fundamental tasks for many species, allowing them to detect, identify, and spatially localize sound sources in their environment. While biological systems have evolved sophisticated neural mechanisms for auditory adaptation, artificial auditory systems still struggle to match their performance, particularly in dynamic and noisy environments. Our research focuses on whether sensor adaptation, driven by efferent feedback from the processing stage to the sensory stage, can improve localization performance. Inspired by human sound source localization based on interaural level differences (ILD) and efferent feedback, the proposed neuromorphic system architecture is composed of two bio-inspired acoustic sensors connected to a neural processing stage, represented by two neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and two neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO). The LSO neuron response was analyzed in the following ways: (i) using measured sensor responses at different ILD without efferent feedback and with a fixed local feedback for each sensor measurement; (ii) simulated with synthetically generated sounds with varying ILDs for four different feedback configurations from the LSO neuron to the acoustic sensors. Results from (i) showed how the feedback tuning can be used to overcome mismatches due to fabrication tolerances between different MEMS sensors, and (ii) showed the influence of different feedback configurations and simulation parameters on the LSO neuron response with respect to different ILDs.",

      "title": "Altered static and dynamic functional network connectivity between subcortical nuclei and cortical regions of the default mode network in type 2 diabetes mellitus",
      "content": "IntroductionDisruptions in functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) are well established as a key neuropathology underlying cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Subcortical nuclei, including the basal forebrain (BF) and mediodorsal thalamus, play critical roles in regulating DMN-associated cognitive processes and are particularly vulnerable to hyperglycemia and brain insulin resistance. However, the specific FC patterns between these subcortical nuclei and DMN cortical regions in patients with T2DM, as well as their potential associations with cognitive impairment, remain incompletely elucidated.MethodsEighty-two patients with T2DM and 79 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were collected from all participants. Resting-state (rs-FNC) and dynamic (dFNC) functional network connectivity analyses were performed to characterize connectivity between subcortical nuclei and DMN cortical regions. Correlation analyses explored associations between FNC metrics showing significant intergroup differences and participants\u2019 clinical and cognitive parameters.Resultsrs-FNC analysis revealed decreased FC between the BF and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), the BF and the temporal pole, and the dMPFC and the anteromedial prefrontal cortex in patients with T2DM (network-based statistic correction; edge p\u202f<\u202f0.001, component p\u202f<\u202f0.05). dFNC analyses indicated increased frequency and prolonged mean dwell time (MDT) of State 1 (high-frequency low-connectivity), as well as decreased frequency and shortened MDT of State 2 (high-frequency high-connectivity) compared with HCs (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Reduced FC between the dMPFC and BF was positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r\u202f=\u202f0.353, p\u202f=\u202f0.001), whereas frequency (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.434, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and MDT (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.376, p\u202f=\u202f0.001) of State 2 were negatively correlated with T2DM disease duration after Bonferroni correction.ConclusionThese findings indicate that T2DM duration correlates with reduced highly efficient DMN connectivity, and that the BF may regulate cognitive function via the dMPFC subsystem. The results reveal temporal and functional specificity in abnormal DMN connectivity in patients with T2DM and enrich the neural atlas of DMN dysfunction in this population.",
