      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "content": "Background: Cognitive decline is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative illness primarily caused by the buildup of amyloid plaque, which is brought on by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Currently, therapeutic agents are focused on addressing clinical symptoms with associated side effects. This study aims to explore the neuroprotective potential of Ocimum gratissimum, a plant known for its richness in bioactive compounds. By investigating its effects on cognitive health, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding dietary interventions for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Thirty-six animals were divided into six groups of six mice each: the control group received distilled water intraperitoneally; the scopolamine group received only scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); the three test groups were fed 5%, 10%, and 20% Ocimum gratissimum-supplemented diets while also receiving scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); and the positive control group received Donepezil (5 mg/kg) followed by the injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.). Donepezil was administered orally 30 minutes before the scopolamine injection. All treatments were administered daily for 14 consecutive days. Results: The supplemented diet groups showed significantly improved spatial memory and navigation compared to the scopolamine-only group. Biochemical analyses revealed that O. gratissimum mitigated scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, with marked improvements in antioxidant enzyme levels, reduced lipid peroxidation, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: Dietary intervention using Ocimum gratissimum leaf was able to improve spatial memory and protect against memory impairment, suggesting its potential as a neuroprotective agent against Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.",

      "title": "A proteomic signature of vascular dysfunction linked to tauopathy and degeneration in the aging brain",
      "content": "Small vessel disease (SVD) impacts healthy aging of organs across the body, yet its contributions to adverse brain aging remain poorly defined. Here we show thromboinflammation, a core feature of SVD, as a driver of adverse brain aging. We identify cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen as a marker of brain thromboinflammation and screen neurovascular biosignatures mediating its impact on synaptic vulnerability along the full spectrum of brain aging from cognitively typical, amyloid-negative to cognitively impaired, amyloid-positive older adults. We identified 53 proteins mediating the effect of fibrinogen on synaptic markers in 1,655 donors from three independent cohorts. Single-cell transcriptomic mapping revealed mediator enrichment in neurovascular unit cells. Pathway analysis demonstrated dysregulation of angiogenesis, fibrosis, and immune signaling. Vascular and microglial-enriched biosignatures associated with compromised white matter integrity. These findings implicate thromboinflammation as an early, amyloid-independent pathway to neurodegeneration and tauopathy, establishing vascular health as fundamental to preserving brain healthspan.",

      "title": "Frontal and Parietal Contributions to Proprioception and Motor Skill Learning",
      "content": "Motor skill learning is the process of developing new movements with practice until they can be performed automatically. This necessitates the interaction of high-level cognitive processes with low-level sensorimotor mechanisms. Skill learning involves not only changes in the motor system but also proprioception (position sense). Proprioceptive deficits increase variability and decrease accuracy of movement. The somatosensory cortex, where low-level proprioception is processed, is known to play a role in motor skill learning, but the involvement of higher-level proprioceptive regions is unclear. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked to the high-level early stages of motor learning, and indirectly to proprioception. Supramarginal gyrus (SMG), an interface area between motor and sensory cortices, has been linked to higher-order proprioceptive processing. In this study, we asked how activity in DLPFC and SMG influences motor skill learning. Participants learned an upper limb motor skill designed to be spatially complex and dependent on proprioception: tracing a two-dimensional maze as accurately as possible within the desired speed range, using a Kinarm Endpoint robotic manipulandum. Proprioceptive acuity (sensitivity and bias) was assessed before and after continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) was applied to inhibit activity in DLPFC, SMG, or Sham. To measure motor skill, movement accuracy and variability were examined at the trained speed as well as at a faster (more difficult) and a slower (easier) speed. Skill was assessed before and after cTBS, after 40 training trials (early learning) and after another 80 trials (late learning). All three groups showed improvements in movement accuracy and variance, indicating they learned the maze tracing skill. However, the Sham group improved movement variability at the faster speed significantly more than the DLPFC or SMG groups did. This suggests that DLPFC and SMG are important for the more challenging aspects of motor skill learning, consistent with their association with higher-level proprioceptive function.",
