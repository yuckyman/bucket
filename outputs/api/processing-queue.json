      "content": "Mutation specific therapeutic approaches, like exon skipping or gene-editing, hold promise for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Translatability of preclinical studies investigating these approaches could greatly be improved through the use of humanized mouse models, as these allow preclinical testing of human specific sequences. We developed four novel humanized DMD mouse models with either a deletion of exon 44, 45, 51 or 53 in the human DMD gene, in a mouse dystrophin negative background (mdx mouse; exon 23 nonsense mutation). Our optimized prescreening pipeline allowed us to do so very efficiently with the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We confirmed either complete lack of dystrophin, or expression of trace levels, which led to development of muscle pathology consisting of muscle fiber de-, and regeneration, inflammation and fibrosis in young adult mice. Intramuscular treatment with vivo-morpholinos targeting a flanking exon induced exon skipping in the DMD strains, which restored the disrupted open reading frame and subsequently dystrophin expression. This validates these models as valuable tools for preclinical studies investigating human sequence specific therapeutic approaches for DMD.",

      "title": "Cognitive Performance and Brain-Predicted Age Difference in Bipolar Disorder",
      "content": "Neuroimaging-derived brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) is a promising marker of advanced brain aging, but its link to cognitive function in bipolar disorder (BD) is not well understood, especially when comparing across publicly available algorithms trained on diverse, large sample datasets and to algorithms trained on local cohorts with rich multimodal imaging data. Our study compares algorithms used to estimate brain-PAD in terms of their clinical relevance to cognition in BD. We included 44 euthymic BD I individuals and 73 HCs who completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and we selected nine scores from this battery for further analyses. Raw scores were log-transformed, scaled, and subjected to PCA; PC1 indexed overall executive function. Four brain-PAD algorithms (PHOTON, BrainageR, DenseNet, Multimodal) were applied to T1-weighted MRI data; the multimodal algorithm also included Diffussion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state Magnetic resonance imaging (rsMRI) data. For each algorithm, we regressed brain-PAD on age, sex, and their interaction to obtain residuals, then used those residualized brain-PADs (which we refer to subsequently as brain-PADs throughout the text) to predict PC1. We then directly assessed if there were group differences in the relationship of brain-PAD to cognitive function by including an interaction term between group x brain-PAD. We found no significant group x brain-PAD interaction across all four algorithms. Given that, we then combined BD and HC and explored whether brain-PAD was a meaningful predictor of cognitive performance. Multimodal brain-PAD emerged as a strong negative predictor of cognitive performance (Beta Estimate = -0.084, SE = 0.024, t = -3.50, p < 0.001), indicating that those with older-appearing brains, as indexed by the brain-PAD, scored lower on PC1. BrainageR brain-PAD also significantly predicted PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.031, SE = 0.0116, t = -2.71, p < 0.01), and DenseNet brain-PAD showed a modest effect (Beta Estimate = -0.0355, SE = 0.0177, t = -2.00, p < 0.05). PHOTON brain-PAD demonstrated a negative trend with PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.024, SE = 0.0127, t = -1.92, p = 0.06). Residualized brain-PAD, after accounting for age and sex, was inversely associated with a composite metric of executive functioning, particularly for an algorithm integrating a range of imaging modalities. Our findings demonstrate how brain aging patterns captured by a neuroimaging-based, ML-derived composite metric could be associated with cognitive performance across algorithms trained on a variety of data granularity and sample sizes.",

      "title": "Deep White-Matter Pathways Mediate the Link Between Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Status and Cognitive Performance in Adolescence",
      "content": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid enriched in neuronal membranes and myelin and associated with cognitive performance. However, nutritional interventions show inconsistent cognitive effects, partly due to limited knowledge of the neural pathways linking DHA status to human cognition during sensitive periods of white-matter maturation, such as adolescence. We addressed this gap by studying 99 adolescents drawn from both extremes of performance on a national scholastic examination. Participants completed assessments of scholastic achievement (SA) and intellectual ability (IA), provided erythrocyte DHA samples, and underwent multimodal MRI, including diffusion, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted imaging. Independent component analysis and Bayesian multivariate LASSO models identified brain components jointly associated with DHA and cognition. Across four MRI modalities, a single deep white-matter component consistently emerged as the strongest shared pathway linking DHA with cognition. Tract-resolved analyses highlighted predominant contributions from the fornix and thalamus - temporal fasciculus, with additional subcortical and cortical involvement. In joint models, these components predicted SA and IA after accounting for DHA and other fatty acids, consistent with an indirect, mediation-like pathway. These findings move beyond DHA - behavior correlations by identifying specific neuroanatomical pathways through which a modifiable dietary factor relates to adolescent learning and intellectual performance, offering mechanistic insight relevant to neuroscience, nutrition, and education.",
