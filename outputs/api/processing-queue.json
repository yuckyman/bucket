      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

This paper is meant as a history of how the standard has developed and grown over time. We outline the principles behind the project, the mechanisms by which it has been extended, and some of the challenges being addressed as it evolves. We also discuss the lessons learned through the project, with the aim of enabling researchers in...",

      "title": "Deciphering the mechanistic basis for the pathological effect of the G\u03b1o E246K mutation in neurodevelopmental disorder",
      "content": "Mutations in the GNAO1 gene, which encodes for Go, a major neuronal G protein, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, and movement disorders. We identified and characterized a spontaneous heterozygous GNAO1 E246K mutation in an Israeli female infant with complex developmental delays and substantial motor difficulties. This mutation has been reported in other cases as a prevalent pathogenic mutation in patients with motor dysfunction and a broad range of neurological outcomes. To investigate the molecular and functional consequences of the Go E246K mutation, we employed structural modeling and analysis, biochemical assays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and cellular functional assays. We show that this mutation does not affect nucleotide binding, nor basal or RGS-accelerated GTP hydrolysis. Despite the E246 position located within a predicted effector binding region, proteomics analysis did not identify any new cellular partners. Instead, we demonstrate that the E246K mutation disrupts the Go regulatory GTPase cycle by directly impairing G{beta}{gamma} dissociation. This impairment overrides the presence of wild-type Go, explaining the dominant effect of the severe neurogenetic phenotype in the heterozygous background. These findings establish a new molecular mechanism for a GNAO1 mutation with dominant-negative effects on the GTPase regulatory cycle. The insights gained from studying this mechanism of action provide a basis for developing specific and personalized therapeutic strategies based on the outcome of a missense mutation in GNAO1.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
