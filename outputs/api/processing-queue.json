      "title": "STeCANet: spatio-temporal cross attention network for brain computer interface systems using EEG-fNIRS signals",
      "content": "Objective. Multimodal neuroimaging fusion has shown promise in enhancing brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) performance by capturing complementary neural dynamics. However, most existing fusion frameworks inadequately model the temporal asynchrony and adaptive fusion between electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), thereby limiting their ability to generalize across sessions and subjects. This work aims to develop an adaptive fusion framework that effectively aligns and integrates EEG and fNIRS representations to improve cross-session and cross-subject generalization in BCI applications. Approach. To address this, we propose STeCANet, a novel Spatiotemporal Cross-Attention Network that integrates EEG and fNIRS signals through hierarchical attention-based alignment. The model leverages fNIRS-guided spatial attention, EEG-fNIRS temporal alignment, adaptive fusion, and adversarial training to ensure robust cross-modal interaction and spatiotemporal consistency. Main results. Evaluations across three cognitive paradigms, namely motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and word generation, demonstrate that STeCANet significantly outperforms unimodal and recent multimodal baselines under both session-independent and subject-independent settings. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each sub-module and loss function, including the domain adaptation component, in boosting classification accuracy and robustness. Significance. These results suggest that STeCANet offers a robust and interpretable solution for next-generation BCI applications.",

      "title": "Binocular vision emerges from the coordinated development of orbit convergence, eye orientation, and high-acuity retinal specializations",
      "content": "Binocular vision requires both eyes to be aligned such that their visual fields overlap. A long-standing premise derived from comparative studies is that the orientation of the orbits determines eye position, and thereby the extension of this overlap, the binocular field. In addition, to produce an accurate neural representation, the binocular field must integrate with the position of retinal high-acuity areas and with the extent of uncrossed retinal projections. It remains unknown, however, whether the binocular field is already formed at the time of eye-opening, as well as when and how it integrates with neuroanatomical visual traits during development. Using the diurnal rodent Octodon degus, a suitable animal model for visual neuroscience, we combined CT-based 3D cranial reconstructions, quantitative measurements of visual-field geometry, whole-mount retinal topography, neural tracing of retinal projections, and behavioral assays to reconstruct the postnatal assembly of the binocular visual system. We show that orbital and ocular orientations shift substantially after birth, broadening the dorsal binocular field; that retinal ganglion cell distributions sharpen into a horizontal visual streak and a defined area centralis; and that ipsilateral projections to the superior colliculus mature in parallel to binocular expansion. These changes coincide with the emergence of binocular-dependent behaviors such as depth discrimination and looming-evoked escape responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that binocular vision emerges through the coordinated alignment of multiple developmental processes across levels of organization.",

      "title": "Successful transfer of myoelectric skill from virtual interface to prosthesis control",
      "content": "Objective. Prosthesis control can be seen as a new skill to be learned. To enhance learning, both internal and augmented feedback are exploited. The latter represents external feedback sources that can be designed to enhance learning, e.g. biofeedback. Previous research has shown that augmented feedback protocols can be designed to induce retention by adhering to the guidance hypothesis, but it is not clear yet if that also results in transfer of those skills to prosthesis control. In this study, we test if a training paradigm optimised for retention allows for the transfer of myoelectric skill to prosthesis control. Approach. Twelve limb-intact participants learned a novel myoelectric skill during five one-hour training sessions. To induce retention of the novel myoelectric skill, we used a delayed feedback paradigm. Prosthesis transfer was tested through pre-and post-tests with a prosthesis. Prosthesis control tests included a grasp matching task, the modified box and blocks test, and an object manipulation task, requiring five grasps in total (\u2018power\u2019, \u2018tripod\u2019, \u2018pointer\u2019, \u2018lateral grip\u2019, and \u2018hand open\u2019). Main results. We found that prosthesis control improved significantly following five days of training. Importantly, the prosthesis control metrics were significantly related to the retention metric during training, but not to the prosthesis performance during the pre-test. Significance. This study shows that transfer of novel, abstract myoelectric control from a computer interface to prosthetic control is possible if the training paradigm is designed to induce retention. These results highlight the importance of approaching myoelectric and prosthetic skills from a skill acquisition standpoint, and open up new avenues for the design of prosthetic training protocols.",

      "title": "An augmented preference-based Bayesian approach for optimizing neuromodulation stimulation parameters using meta learning",
      "content": "Background. Electrical neuromodulation is increasingly used in the treatment of neurological disorders; however, the selection of stimulation parameters that provide optimal therapeutic benefits remains a major challenge. Moreover, identifying pathological biomarkers linking the effect of stimulation parameters to alleviating symptoms, and hence required for optimizing stimulation parameters, might not always be possible. Objective. We present an augmented, preference-based Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize stimulation parameters for participants undergoing neuromodulation. This algorithm incorporates two key features: I) It prioritizes the participant\u2019s preferences for stimulation parameters, making it independent of the need for pathological biomarkers. II) It leverages meta learning, using historical participant data to guide the initial optimization for new participants and overcome initial data sparsity. This approach improves both prediction accuracy and convergence speed. Approach. Consider preference training data collected from a set of historical participants who share the same neurological disorder as a new (target) participant. Within that population, there may be different response phenotypes. The goal is to identify historical participants whose stimulation-response phenotype is most similar to the target participant, and leverage their data to accelerate and improve parameter optimization for the target participant. To achieve this, the algorithm iteratively performs a two-step process:(I) a novel, iterative weighting procedure that identifies historical participants with stimulation preferences closest to the target participant, and (II) meta learning that combines the training data of the identified participants with the limited training data of the target participant to train novel, augmented preference learning models. These models are then used to predict the stimulation parameters expected to maximize the target participant\u2019s preference. Mainresults. The proposed algorithm has been validated using synthetically generated data sets that simulate participant preference behavior during neuromodulation. Significance. This approach holds promise for improving personalized neuromodulation therapies and advancing treatment outcomes for neurological disorders without the need for a tedious data collection process and disease-specific pathological biomarkers.",

      "title": "Intracranial hypotension headache complicated by retroclival subdural hematoma: clinical insights and literature review",
      "content": "BackgroundRetroclival subdural hematoma (rcSDH) secondary to spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an exceedingly rare clinical entity, characterized by complex and incompletely understood pathophysiological mechanisms.CaseA 24-year-old female presented with acute and persistent orthostatic headache, with no history of trauma or anticoagulant therapy. Neuroimaging revealed subdural hematomas (SDH) located in the retroclival, infratentorial, and right frontal regions. It was hypothesized that veinous rupture, resulting from venous traction due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, was the underlying mechanism. Following epidural blood patch (EBP) therapy, the patient exhibited marked symptomatic improvement and radiological resolution of hematomas on follow-up imaging.ConclusionRcSDH is considered an uncommon complication of SIH, potentially resulting from venous rupture in the retroclival subdural space due to reduced CSF pressure. SIH should be considered in cases of rcSDH. The treatment is typically focused on addressing the underlying etiology, with early diagnosis and timely intervention being essential for achieving favorable outcomes. In cases of severe brainstem compression, hematoma evacuation should be performed in conjunction with EBP.",

      "title": "Skull stripping tools in pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans: a retrospective evaluation of segmentation performance",
      "content": "IntroductionFor brain maturity assessment of infants aged above 6 months, T2-weighted MRI scans are recommended. Prior to automated brain tissue analysis, skull stripping is typically applied. However, most skull stripping tools neither focus on T2-weighted scans nor on pediatric cohorts. Here, we present the evaluation results of seven common skull stripping tools in a comparably large pediatric cohort.MethodsThis study is based on 199 T2-weighted scans of children under the age of 5 years retrospectively acquired from the clinical routine at Hannover Medical School. We established a manually labeled ground truth under quality control of a senior neuroradiologist specialized in pediatric neuroradiology and evaluated seven skull stripping tools (BET, ROBEX, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast, SynthStrip, SynthStrip-noCSF and d-SynthStrip). Segmentation performance (Dice score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, specificity) and computation time were assessed on non-preprocessed and preprocessed scans (zero padding, contrast enhancement, artifact removal and normalization) as well as in different brain regions. For the best performing model, we manually assessed the top and bottom quartile of segmentations with respect to the integrity of different anatomical brain structures.ResultsOnly BET, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast profited from data preprocessing. Considering this, all models had median Dice scores between 0.88 and 0.96, with SynthStrip performing best. All models segmented most accurately in the middle axial slices of the brain. Resampling lowered the performance of all models, except ROBEX. Mean computing times ranged from 2\u202fs (BET) to 132\u202fs (HD-BET) with SynthStrip requiring 7\u202fs. per scan. SynthStrip was prone to not entirely including the Sinus sagittalis superior, the upper Cerebrum, the temporal pole, the Cerebellum and the Chiasma opticum/pituitary gland. In contrast, the petrous bone and the skull in the middle axial slices have often been partly included.DiscussionDue to its robustness and quick computation time, we recommend SynthStrip for skull stripping of pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans. We attribute the observed segmentation errors to the partial volume effect, which should be addressed in future research. Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting, the exclusion of pathological cases and the skewed age distribution in our cohort.",

      "content": "IntroductionIn this study, we propose a data-driven approach that integrates behavioral diagnosis with neuroimaging features to identify representative UWS and MCS patients from a large inpatient cohort.MethodsClinical information was extracted using a subset of UWS patients with CRS-R scores \u2264 5. Neuroimaging biomarkers were established as the increased and decreased functional connectivity indices of anatomically defined regions covering the whole brain. The algorithm was implemented through an iterative refinement process that converged on a division of UWS and MCS patients into representative and excluded (or nonrepresentative) patient groups.ResultsThirty-one out of 58 UWS patients and 23 out of 30 MCS patients were identified as representative, with an average classification accuracy of 90.2% in differentiating between the two groups. In contrast, differentiating between excluded UWS patients (n =\u202f27) and representative MCS patients (n =\u202f23) and between all UWS (n =\u202f58) and MCS (n =\u202f30) patients produced average classification accuracies of 50.9 and 64.3%, respectively. Furthermore, altered DMN functional connectivity between representative UWS and MCS patients revealed a consistent pattern as shown in prior studies, while comparisons involving excluded patients did not.DiscussionThese results highlight the value of integrating behavioral scores and neural connectivity features for DOC classification, providing a more coherent basis for downstream analysis and machine-learning applications in DOC classification.",

      "title": "An automated workflow for quantifying the formation of synuclein aggregates in human dopaminergic neurons",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-synuclein (-syn) aggregates termed Lewy bodies. To model PD pathology in vitro, preformed fibrils of -syn (PFFs), which can be taken up by cells, provide a seed that drives misfolding and aggregation of endogenous -syn, with new aggregates amplifying this process. External application of PFFs to dopaminergic neurons (DNs) increases aggregate formation, marked by -syn phosphorylation at serine 129 (pS129-syn), a pathological PD marker. Building on this, we developed an automated synuclein seeding assay to quantify new -syn aggregates in iPSC-derived DNs. Using pS129-syn as a readout, we show that PFFs elicit a time- and dose-dependent increase in pS129-syn aggregates. Our high-throughput assay further revealed that aggregate formation depends on endogenous -syn levels. Treatment with PFFs produced a greater increase in pS129-syn aggregates in iPSC DNs derived from a PD patient with a triplication in the SNCA gene, which encodes the -syn protein and which elevates total -syn levels, relative to DNs from an isogenic iPSC line from the same individual, in which the SNCA gene mutation had been corrected by CRISPR/Cas9. In contrast, no pS129-syn signal was detected in neurons in which all copies of the SNCA gene had been knocked out (KO). This high-content imaging assay for synuclein seeding offers a platform for assessing compounds and therapeutics that may impede -syn aggregate formation.",

      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",
