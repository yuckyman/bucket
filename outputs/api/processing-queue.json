      "content": "arXiv:2601.10236v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI writing assistants can reduce effort and improve fluency, but they may also weaken writers' sense of authorship. We study this tension with an ownership-aware co-writing editor that offers on-demand, sentence-level suggestions and tests two common design choices: persona-based coaching and style personalization. In an online study (N=176), participants completed three professional writing tasks: an email without AI help, a proposal with generic AI suggestions, and a cover letter with persona-based coaching, while half received suggestions tailored to a brief sample of their prior writing. Across the two AI-assisted tasks, psychological ownership dropped relative to unassisted writing (about 0.85-1.0 points on a 7-point scale), even as cognitive load decreased (about 0.9 points) and quality ratings stayed broadly similar overall. Persona coaching did not prevent the ownership decline. Style personalization partially restored ownership (about +0.43) and increased AI incorporation in text (+5 percentage points). We distill five design patterns: on-demand initiation, micro-suggestions, voice anchoring, audience scaffolds, and point-of-decision provenance, to guide authorship-preserving writing tools.",

      "title": "Tables or Sankey Diagrams? Investigating User Interaction with Different Representations of Simulation Parameters",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10232v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding complex parameter dependencies is critical for effective configuration and maintenance of software systems across diverse domains - from Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) to cloud infrastructure and database management. However, legacy tabular interfaces create a major bottleneck: engineers cannot easily comprehend how parameters relate across the system, leading to inefficient workflows, costly configuration errors, and reduced system trust - a fundamental program comprehension challenge in configuration-intensive software. This research evaluates whether interactive Sankey diagrams can improve comprehension of parameter dependencies compared to traditional spreadsheet interfaces. We employed a heuristic evaluation using the PURE method with three expert evaluators (UX design, simulation, and software development specialists) to compare a Sankey-based prototype to traditional tabular representations for core engineering tasks. Our key contribution demonstrates that flow-based parameter visualizations significantly reduce cognitive load (51% lower PURE scores) and interaction complexity (56% fewer steps) compared to traditional tables, while making parameter dependencies immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction. By explicitly visualizing parameter relationships, Sankey diagrams address a core software visualization challenge: helping users comprehend complex system configurations without requiring deep tool-specific knowledge. While demonstrated through CAE software, this research contributes to program comprehension and software visualization by showing that dependency-aware visualizations can significantly improve understanding of configuration-intensive systems. The findings have implications for any software domain where comprehending complex parameter relationships is essential for effective system use and maintenance.",

      "title": "Empowering Older Adults in Digital Technology Use with Foundation Models",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10018v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While high-quality technology support can assist older adults in using digital applications, many struggle to articulate their issues due to unfamiliarity with technical terminology and age-related cognitive changes. This study examines these communication challenges and explores AI-based approaches to mitigate them. We conducted a diary study with English-speaking, community-dwelling older adults to collect asynchronous, technology-related queries and used reflexive thematic analysis to identify communication barriers. To address these barriers, we evaluated how foundation models can paraphrase older adults' queries to improve solution accuracy. Two controlled experiments followed: one with younger adults evaluating AI-rephrased queries and another with older adults evaluating AI-generated solutions. We also developed a pipeline using large language models to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). We identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. Our prompt-chaining approach using the large language model, GPT-4o, elicited contextual details, paraphrased the original query, and generated a solution. AI-rephrased queries significantly improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%) and Google search results (69% vs. 35%). Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries (93.7% vs. 65.8%) and reported greater confidence and ease. Older adults reported high perceived ability to answer contextual questions (89.8%) and follow solutions (94.7%), with high confidence and ease. OATS demonstrated strong fidelity and face validity. This work shows how foundation models can enhance technology support for older adults by addressing age-related communication barriers. The OATS dataset offers a scalable resource for developing equitable AI systems that better serve aging populations.",

However, the technical overhead to deploy and manage these distinct systems is a major barrier. We present UXLab, an open-source system for web-based user studies that addresses this challenge. Its core is a web-based dashboard enabling the complete, no-code configuration of complex experimental designs. Researchers can visually manage the full study, from recruitment to comparing backends like traditional search, vector databases, and LLMs. We demonstrate UXLab's value via a micro case study comparing user behavior with RAG versus an autonomous agent.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09928v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A fundamental tension exists between the demand for sophisticated AI assistance in web search and the need for user data privacy. Current centralized models require users to transmit sensitive browsing data to external services, which limits user control. In this paper, we present a browser extension that provides a viable in-browser alternative. We introduce a hybrid architecture that functions entirely on the client side, combining two components: (1) an adaptive probabilistic model that learns a user's behavioral policy from direct feedback, and (2) a Small Language Model (SLM), running in the browser, which is grounded by the probabilistic model to generate context-aware suggestions. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a three-week longitudinal user study with 18 participants. Our results show that this privacy-preserving approach is highly effective at adapting to individual user behavior, leading to measurably improved search efficiency. This work demonstrates that sophisticated AI assistance is achievable without compromising user privacy or data control.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09898v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Politeness is a core dimension of human communication, yet its role in human-AI information seeking remains underexplored. We investigate how user politeness behaviour shapes conversational outcomes in a cooking-assistance setting. First, we annotated 30 dialogues, identifying four distinct user clusters ranging from Hyperpolite to Hyperefficient. We then scaled up to 18,000 simulated conversations across five politeness profiles (including impolite) and three open-weight models. Results show that politeness is not only cosmetic: it systematically affects response length, informational gain, and efficiency. Engagement-seeking prompts produced up to 90% longer replies and 38% more information nuggets than hyper-efficient prompts, but at markedly lower density. Impolite inputs yielded verbose but less efficient answers, with up to 48% fewer nuggets per watt-hour compared to polite input. These findings highlight politeness as both a fairness and sustainability issue: conversational styles can advantage or disadvantage users, and \"polite\" requests may carry hidden energy costs. We discuss implications for inclusive and resource-aware design of information agents.",

      "title": "The Algorithmic Gaze: An Audit and Ethnography of the LAION-Aesthetics Predictor Model",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.09896v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visual generative AI models are trained using a one-size-fits-all measure of aesthetic appeal. However, what is deemed \"aesthetic\" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of \"aesthetics\" toward more pluralistic evaluation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09887v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Contemporary materials science research is heavily conducted in silico, involving massive simulations of the atomic-scale evolution of materials. Cataloging basic patterns in the atomic displacements is key to understanding and predicting the evolution of physical properties. However, the combinatorial complexity of the space of possible transitions coupled with the overwhelming amount of data being produced by high-throughput simulations make such an analysis extremely challenging and time-consuming for domain experts. The development of visual analytics systems that facilitate the exploration of simulation data is an active field of research. While these systems excel in identifying temporal regions of interest, they treat each timestep of a simulation as an independent event without considering the behavior of the atomic displacements between timesteps. We address this gap by introducing LAMDA, a visual analytics system that allows domain experts to quickly and systematically explore state-to-state transitions. In LAMDA, transitions are hierarchically categorized, providing a basis for cataloging displacement behavior, as well as enabling the analysis of simulations at different resolutions, ranging from very broad qualitative classes of transitions to very narrow definitions of unit processes. LAMDA supports navigating the hierarchy of transitions, enabling scientists to visualize the commonalities between different transitions in each class in terms of invariant features characterizing local atomic environments, and LAMDA simplifies the analysis by capturing user inputs through annotations. We evaluate our system through a case study and report on findings from our domain experts.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09877v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The emergence of AI twins, digital replicas that encapsulate an individual's knowledge, memories, psychological traits, and behavioral patterns, raises novel legal and ethical challenges for data governance and personal identity. Built from personal data, these systems require a rethinking of what it means to exercise dominion over one's data and to maintain personal autonomy in an AI-mediated environment. This article argues that natural persons should be recognized as the moral and legal owners of their AI twins, which function as intimate extensions of the self rather than as proprietary technological artifacts. It critiques prevailing legal frameworks that prioritize technological infrastructure and platform control over data and individual autonomy, exposing their structural limitations. In response, the article advances a human-centric model of data governance grounded in individual dominion and a private-by-default principle. This approach proposes a reimagined social contract for AI-driven identities that strengthens personal agency, promotes equitable data stewardship, and better aligns legal norms with the socio-technical realities of AI twins.",

      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Developer Interaction Patterns with Proactive AI: A Five-Day Field Study",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10253v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current in-IDE AI coding tools typically rely on time-consuming manual prompting and context management, whereas proactive alternatives that anticipate developer needs without explicit invocation remain underexplored. Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment. This study provides actionable implications for designing proactive coding assistants, including how to time interventions, align them with developer context, and strike a balance between AI agency and user control in production IDEs.",

      "title": "Self-organized Recovery of Coordinated Locomotion in Crickets Revealed by Prosthetic Limb Integration",
      "content": "Distributed sensorimotor interactions facilitate the coordination of multilegged locomotion in insects without centralized control, yet the mechanisms that allow coordinated locomotion to re-emerge following limb loss remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the effects of leg amputation and the integration of prosthetic legs on walking coordination in crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Spherical treadmill experiments revealed that leg amputation disrupts inter-leg phase coupling, decreases locomotor speed, and alters spatial foot placement in a state-dependent manner, indicating impaired load-mediated coordination. Prosthetic legs did not merely restore intact kinematics; instead, they selectively reinstated coherent temporal coordination and axis-specific spatial organization. This structured recovery illustrates that re-introducing mechanically relevant sensory constraints is sufficient to re-engage distributed coordination networks, even in the absence of anatomical integrity. Our findings elucidate an embodied principle through which sensory-mechanical feedback facilitates the self-organization of resilient multi-legged locomotion in the context of morphological interventions.",
