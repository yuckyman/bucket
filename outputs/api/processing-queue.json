      "content": "Real-world neuroimaging requires true portability and sensitivity to detect signals from neuronal activity. Conventional methods such as MRI, EEG, or PET are constrained by their size and instrumentation complexity. Near Infra-Red (NIR) based optical methods have the potential for sensitive detection with a smaller footprint. Despite rapid advances in NIR detection there is no known device that is implementable using off-the-shelf integrated microprocessors and possesses the above desired characteristics along with proven sensitivity to detect task evoked responses. Here, we present a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled, high-sensitivity wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device designed for untethered cortical hemodynamic monitoring during naturalistic cognitive tasks. Our fully integrated optical sensing device merges optical data acquisition and wireless transmission into a compact, cable-free platform with a very small footprint. This enables continuous multi-channel recording without placing any constraint on the movement of the subject. We validate our device for reliable detection of task-evoked oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin dynamics in the forearm, primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Subsequently, we capture real-time forebrain activity during a screen-based learning and memory task, revealing robust goal-specific hemodynamic responses. We formulate a method to identify the instances of peak neuronal activity and follow the task Evoked Instances of Differential Oxygen influx(tEIDO) as the subject is engaged in a task. These results highlight the potential of our proposed fNIRS device as a mobile neuroimaging solution for next-generation brain-computer interfaces and real-world cognitive monitoring.",

      "content": "Aging is associated with impaired CSF clearance in preclinical models, but its impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) health and glymphatic function in humans remains unclear. We aimed to compare healthy younger and older adults using multimodal MRI to assess age-related changes in BBB permeability and glymphatic clearance, and to examine the relationships between these measures. Thirty participants were recruited (12 younger, 26 {+/-} 3 years; 18 older, 75 {+/-} 7 years). Diffusion-prepared arterial spin labeling measured the water exchange rate (Kw) across the BBB; free water (FW) imaging quantified extracellular free water in white matter; and diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces (DTI-ALPS) assessed glymphatic function. Older individuals showed reduced whole-brain Kw (p=0.021), increased white matter FW (p=0.002), and reduced DTI-ALPS (p<0.001) compared to younger adults. Kw associated with both DTI-ALPS ({beta}=0.402x10-2, p=0.022) and FW ({beta}=-0.676x10-3, p=0.008). Reduced Kw may reflect impaired BBB function, while reduced DTI-ALPS and increased FW indicate impaired glymphatic clearance. FW partially mediated the relationship between Kw and DTI-ALPS, suggesting a potential mechanistic link. Overall, this study provides novel multimodal MRI insights into BBB and glymphatic alterations in healthy aging and may inform the development of MRI biomarkers to preserve cognitive health.",

      "title": "Early life stress induces social behavioral deficits and peripheral biomarker alterations in adolescence that perpetuate intergenerationally",
      "content": "Early life stress (ELS) increases the likelihood of developing chronic health problems including mental illness. In humans, deficits in social behavior often emerge during adolescence and correlate with later-life psychiatric diagnoses. We examined in mice the effects of a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model of ELS on pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during postnatal days 3-9 (P3-P9). Then on P30, an adolescent timepoint, we assessed social behavior as well as thymus involution and adrenal hypertrophy, both biomarkers of stress. We found reductions in USVs as early as P3, resembling low levels normally seen later in development. There were few changes in SI, with deficits observed only after restraint stress in female LBN mice. Surprisingly, thymus weights were augmented and adrenal glands were smaller in LBN adolescent mice, opposite to alterations typically observed after chronic adult stress. LBN also produced signs of precocious puberty in both sexes, especially in cohorts of LBN-exposed offspring bred to create second-generation LBN offspring that subsequently underwent LBN, indicating perpetuation across generations. Together, these data suggest that stress in early life has distinct and diverse effects, including accelerating several processes, and that some of these effects persist intergenerationally.",

      "title": "Visuomotor adaptation enhances representational acuity without altering spatial bias",
      "content": "IntroductionPrism adaptation is a well-established paradigm for studying sensorimotor plasticity, known to produce not only motor after-effects but also changes in spatial cognition. Whether visuomotor rotation\u2014a similar form of sensorimotor adaptation\u2014elicits comparable cognitive transfer remains unclear.MethodsParticipants performed visuomotor rotation tasks involving either leftward or rightward 15\u00b0 rotations. The perturbation was introduced either abruptly (within one trial) or gradually (over 34 trials). To assess potential cognitive transfer, participants completed a perceptual line bisection task before and after adaptation.ResultsNo condition (leftward/rightward or abrupt/gradual) induced measurable cognitive after-effects in line bisection performance, indicating an absence of transfer from sensorimotor to spatial-cognitive domains. However, a novel finding emerged: visuomotor rotation enhanced participants\u2019 representational acuity, reflected in improved sensitivity when judging the midpoint of a line. This effect was most pronounced following gradual perturbations and persisted beyond the adaptation phase.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate a clear dissociation between the cognitive and perceptual consequences of visuomotor adaptation. Visuomotor rotation thus provides a reliable means to study sensorimotor plasticity without altering spatial representation\u2014a methodological advantage for investigating populations with atypical spatial biases. The enhancement of representational acuity further suggests that sensorimotor learning can refine spatial discrimination independently of cognitive recalibration.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",
