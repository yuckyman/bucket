This does 2 things: 1. obfuscates the code, 2. lets you do all sorts of wacky formatting. This isn't really useful for anything besides making ASCII art, but I think it's pretty fun. It supports almost all of Python's syntax with a few exceptions (match statements, async functions). </p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>People who enjoy making ASCII art or obfuscated programs</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>As far as I know, there are no similar projects that exist. The closest is python-minifier: <a href=\"https://python-minifier.com\">https://python-minifier.com</a>, which I use in this project for constant folding and variable renaming. However, python-minifier doesn't change statements to expressions, and the output cant be made into ASCII art. </p> <p>A basic example:</p> <pre><code>def basic_func(): x = 0 for i in range(10): if x &lt; 5: x += 1 elif x &gt; 2: x += 2 elif x &gt; 3: x += 3 else: x = 0 return x basic_func = lambda: [(x := 0), [(x := (x + 1)) if x &lt; 5 else (x := (x + 2)) if x &gt; 2 else (x := (x + 3)) if x &gt; 3 else (x := 0) for i in range(10)], x][-1] </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Weird_Pop9005\"> /u/Weird_Pop9005 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzwkq0/i_made_a_normal_syntax_expression_only_syntax/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzwkq0/i_made_a_normal_syntax_expression_only_syntax/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Cada: A build plugin for publishing interdependent libraries from uv workspaces",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What my project does?</h1> <p>I've been working in a monorepo managed with a <a href=\"https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/workspaces/\">uv workspace</a> and ran into an annoying issue. When you build and publish an internal library that depends on another workspace member, the resulting wheel has no version constraint on that internal dependency.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada\">Cada</a> is a small hatchling plugin that fixes this. Cada resolves uv workspace members' versions at build time and adds proper version constraints to internal dependencies. You can choose different strategies: pin to exact version, allow patch updates, semver-style, etc.</p> <p>```toml [build-system] requires = [&quot;hatchling&quot;, &quot;hatch-cada&quot;] build-backend = &quot;hatchling.build&quot;</p> <p>[project] name = &quot;my-client&quot; dependencies = [&quot;my-core&quot;]</p> <p>[tool.uv.sources] my-core = { workspace = true }</p> <p>[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.cada] strategy = &quot;allow-all-updates&quot; ```</p> <p>With the above configuration, the built wheel will declare a dependency on my-core&gt;=1.2.3. That way, you keep unversioned dependencies during development and get proper constraints automatically when you publish.</p> <h1>What is the intended audience?</h1> <p>This is for anyone distributing Python libraries from a uv workspace to PyPI (or any registry) to consumers outside of the workspace.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/carderne/una\"><strong>Una</strong></a> bundles all workspace dependencies into a single wheel. Great for applications you deploy yourself (Docker images, Lambda functions, CLI tools). Cada takes the opposite approach: each package keeps its own version and release cycle. It's meant for distributing libraries to users outside of the monorepo.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Opentrons/hatch-plugins/tree/main/hatch-dependency-coversion\"><strong>hatch-dependency-coversion</strong></a> rewrites dependency versions to match the current package's version (lockstep versioning). Cada resolves each dependency's actual version independently, each package can have it's own release cycle, but it also supports lockstep versioning if you want to. Cada simply reads your packages versions and does not make assumptions on your versioning strategy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/ninoseki/uv-dynamic-versioning\"><strong>uv-dynamic-versioning</strong></a> requires moving dependencies to a non-standard location with templating syntax. Cada keeps standard project.dependencies, so tools like Dependabot, pip-audit, and monorepo build tools (Nx, Moon) keep working out of the box.</p> <p>It's a narrow use case but happy to hear feedback or answer questions if some of you find it useful.</p> <p>Github repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada\"> https://github.com/bilelomrani1/hatch-cada </a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bOmrani\"> /u/bOmrani </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q01ayz/cada_a_build_plugin_for_publishing_interdependent/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q01ayz/cada_a_build_plugin_for_publishing_interdependent/\">[comments]</a></span>",
