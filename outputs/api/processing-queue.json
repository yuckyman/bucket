      "title": "Processing of Emotional Faces Has Unique Functional and Cytoarchitectural Associations in those with an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis.",
      "content": "Those with an autism spectrum diagnosis (ASD) have been found to process emotional faces differently than other populations. Processing of emotional faces requires engagement of temporal, frontal, occipital, and limbic brain regions. Functional activity has been shown to differ in those with an ASD, particularly in the amygdala, inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and temporal brain regions. However, the consistency and direction of these associations have been inconsistent across studies. Recent findings have demonstrated that measures of neuron density differ in those with an ASD. Some of these regional differences in cytoarchitecture coincide with regions important to emotional facial processing. Therefore, the interaction between cytoarchitecture and functional activity may be important in elucidating unique neurophysiology in ASD. The present study uses diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the relationship between cytoarchitecture and functional activity during emotional face processing in those with an ASD. 75 individuals with a reported ASD and 6,396 individuals with no reported diagnosis of an ASD (nASD) were identified. The emotional n-back (EN-Back) task was administered during fMRI acquisition, activating regions of the brain associated with processing emotional faces. Neuron cell body density was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala in the ASD group but not the nASD group. These findings suggest that a unique relationship may exist between neuron cell body density in the left amygdala and functional activity while processing emotional faces in those with an ASD.",

      "title": "A Common Neural Signal of Evidence Accumulation for Perceptual and Mnemonic Decisions",
      "content": "Humans frequently make decisions based on sensory input from the external environment or information retrieved from memory. The centro-parietal positivity (CPP), an event-related EEG potential, has recently been identified as a neural correlate of sensory evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this component also reflects evidence accumulation during decisions based on long-term memory. The present study investigated whether the CPP serves as a domain-general signal of evidence accumulation across both perception and semantic memory-based decisions. We designed a visual discrimination task in which participants discriminated between the luminance of two alphanumeric strings across three levels of difficulty defined by the luminance difference. In a semantic memory task, participants discriminated between the populations of two different U.S. states, binned into three difficulty levels using US census data. After each decision, participants rated their confidence on a scale from 1 (very low) to 4 (very high). We observed a CPP component in both tasks, the slope of which scaled with the sensory or mnemonic evidence in both stimulus- and response-locked analyses. Furthermore, these CPP slopes were sensitive to reaction times (RT) and confidence in both tasks. Finally, the peak height of the CPP just prior to the response, indicative of one's decision boundary, was strongly correlated across tasks, suggesting that a common threshold was applied to the abstract evidence quantity being accumulated. Our results indicate that the CPP can be used to track the unfolding dynamics underlying decisions made both on the basis of external sensory evidence and internal mnemonic evidence.",

      "title": "Disrupted Top-Down Modulation as a Mechanism of Impaired Multisensory Processing in Children with an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis.",
      "content": "Atypical sensory processing is a core feature of autism, particularly when integration across sensory modalities is required. The neural mechanisms underlying these multisensory differences remain unclear. We recorded high-density EEG while autistic children aged 8 to 13 (AU; n=40), unaffected siblings of autistic children (SIB; n=26), and non-autistic controls (NA; n=36) performed a simple reaction-time task to auditory (A), visual (V), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli. Analyses targeted event-related potentials (ERPs; P1/N1/P2), alpha-band event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), and long-range theta-band functional connectivity (weighted phase-lag index, wPLI). Across all unisensory measures (ERPs, alpha-ERD, and connectivity), groups did not differ, indicating broadly comparable unisensory processing. By contrast, multisensory integration (MSI; operationalized for ERPs and alpha-ERD as AV - (A+V)) differed across groups: NA children showed significant ERP MSI over parieto-central sites that was absent in AU and SIB; and alpha-ERD MSI was present in all groups but significantly reduced in AU, with SIB showing an intermediate profile. Connectivity analyses revealed that AV theta-band fronto-parieto-occipital coupling was reduced in autistic relative to non-autistic children, consistent with weaker large-scale coordination during multisensory processing. Together, these results point to a multisensory-specific deficit in autism spanning early sensory encoding, posterior alpha-ERD, and fronto-posterior coupling. The convergence of results supports a mechanistic account of disrupted multisensory influences on sensory processing due to reduced multisensory attentional orientation. Intermediate SIB profiles suggest inherited liability for these neural phenotypes. These results help explain well-documented behavioral MSI differences in autism by linking impaired early enhancement with attenuated top-down control of sensory cortex.",

      "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
      "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

      "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
      "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

      "title": "Multivariate environmental exposures are reflected in whole-brain functional connectivity and cognition in youth",
      "content": "Each individual's complex, multidimensional environment, known as their 'exposome', plays an essential role in shaping cognitive neurodevelopment. Understanding the mechanisms whereby children's exposome influences their development is crucial to facilitate the design of interventions to foster positive developmental trajectories for all youth. Recent work has identified a general exposome factor associated with socio-economic inequality that is strongly related to cognition and individual differences in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in youth. Building on these findings, the current study explores whether alterations in functional connectivity may represent a potential mechanism linking variation in the exposome to cognitive performance. We apply a data-driven, cross-validated, whole-brain machine learning approach, connectome-based statistical inference, to identify patterns of functional connectivity associated with exposome scores among early adolescents enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using data collected during three cognitive tasks and during rest. Additionally, we investigate whether the identified patterns of functional connectivity relate to individual differences in cognitive performance across three domains: General Cognition, Executive Functioning, and Learning/Memory. Models incorporating 10-fold cross-validation over 100 iterations identified consistent functional connections associated with the exposome across task and rest conditions (model performance: ns = 6,137-8,391, rs = 0.34 - 0.44, ps <.001). Results were robust across data collection sites and functional connections common across all significant models were associated with cognitive performance across domains (ps < 0.0009). Collectively, these findings reveal that multidimensional environmental exposures are reflected in patterns of functional connectivity and relate to cognitive functioning among youth.",

To this end, we chemogenetically inhibited OT-expressing neurons during three critical periods of development (in infants, juveniles, and young adults) in male and female mice, followed by a longitudinal study to assess behaviour and metabolic perturbations. The most pronounced behavioural effects are observed after inhibition during infancy in both sexes. Notably, social memory is consistently impaired in males, regardless of the inactivation period. From a metabolic perspective, in adulthood, an increase in body weight is observed in all cohorts of males but fat mass and adipocyte size increase after inhibition of OT-expressing neurons during juvenile period. In addition, we observed a significant delay in the day of birth and an alteration in feeding behaviour in neonates after inhibiting OT-expressing neurons around the time of birth. Thus, inhibition of OT neurons during three postnatal periods has direct, distinct, and long-lasting consequences on social behaviour and metabolism, depending on the sex and on the timing of inactivation. Our results also demonstrate a role of foetal/neonate oxytocin neurons in the timing of birth and in early feeding behaviour.",

      "title": "Expansion of Working Memory Capacity Supports Early Skill Learning",
      "content": "Real-world motor skills depend on the precise spatiotemporal coordination of action sequences refined through practice. Working memory, which transiently maintains and manipulates task-relevant information, supports skill acquisition expanding with extensive training, as shown in expert domains such as in master chess players. Yet, the temporal dynamics of working memory emergence and expansion during the rapid performance gains that define early skill learning remain unclear. We addressed this question across three experiments in which participants learned various naturalistic sequential keypress skills. Within each practice trial, we observed segments of high-initial-skill (HIS)--transient periods of elevated performance followed by skill drops--that persisted throughout training. The keypress content of HIS segments scaled with execution speed and systematically increased with practice, reflecting an expansion of keypress chunk content consistent with the progressive enlargement of working memory capacity. Importantly, HIS segment keypress content continued to rise even after overall performance plateaued. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling ({theta}/{gamma} PAC) and beta ({beta})-band bursts, mechanisms implicated in maintaining and binding individual actions into sequences in working memory, were elevated during HIS segments with hippocampal {theta}/{gamma} PAC predicting HIS segment content. Our results suggest that working memory capacity expands during early learning of a naturalistic skill and continues strengthening with practice after skill plateau is reached, possibly supported by hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling.",

      "content": "ObjectivesBy employing deep learning-based automatic whole-brain region segmentation technology, we aim to investigate the cross-sectional associations between regional brain volumes and disease duration in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).MethodsA retrospective study design was implemented on 83 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD who had complete clinical and imaging data. Cranial magnetic resonance images (MRI) were imported into the uAI platform for automated regional segmentation of brain tissue. Volumetric data from five major brain regions and 80 subregions were extracted to explore their potential associations with disease progression in PD patients. Statistical analysis was conducted using a multiple linear regression model within the framework of linear regression analysis, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05.ResultsCross-sectional analysis revealed that in PD patients, volume ratios of multiple brain regions\u2014including the bilateral precentral gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobules, bilateral precuneus, right cuneus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, and right globus pallidus\u2014were negatively associated with disease duration (p < 0.05). In contrast, the right hippocampus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus showed positive correlations (p < 0.05). The combined volume ratios of these brain regions also decreased with longer disease duration (p < 0.05). Furthermore, absolute volume differences in the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, and cerebellar white matter increased as the disease progressed (p < 0.05).ConclusionIn PD patients, volume ratios and absolute volume differences in specific brain subregions associated with lateralized intracranial changes may serve as potential biomarkers for assessing brain tissue alterations during disease progression.",

      "title": "Supporting autistic adults with complex communication needs in making their voices heard: examining an adaptation of the Autism Voices framework",
      "content": "IntroductionAutistic adults with speech, language and/or cognitive challenges are often excluded from research, particularly from studies examining first-person perspectives, as these generally require that participants have strong speech, language, and cognitive skills. The current pilot study extends previous work and examines whether the Autism Voices framework can be adapted for use with a pre-existing interview the Camberwell Assessment of Need for Adults with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities-Research version (CANDID-R).MethodsEleven young autistic adults with complex communication needs completed the CANDID-R interview using visual supports. These visual supports were provided to assist participants\u2019 comprehension of interview questions and to support them in answering the interview questions. Participants\u2019 caregivers also completed the interview and their answers to specific validation questions were compared to those of their adult children. Additionally, behavioral observations were also completed.ResultsThe findings from this pilot study indicate that our adaptation of the Autism Voices framework was, at least partially successful in supporting participants in answering the interview questions. Additionally, behavioral observations indicate that the visual supports helped participants remain engaged throughout the interview. However, results also indicate that further adaptations, which we discuss, will be required.ConclusionAutistic people with complex communication needs must be included in research about the lived experiences of autistic people. Building on previous work, we show that, with dedication and imagination, equitable and inclusive research is possible.",

      "title": "Cross-modal neuroplasticity in partial hearing loss: a mini-review",
      "content": "Sensory loss induces adaptive neural changes in the remaining non-deprived senses, known as cross-modal plasticity. Recent proposals of cross-modal plasticity suggest that it is a top-down, dynamic phenomenon that can occur through the lifespan and is initiated whether sensory loss is total (as in blindness or deafness) or more subtle (mild-to-moderate partial sensory loss). However, it is unclear whether adaptive plasticity differs between total and partial loss, because there is less research on the latter condition. Here we reviewed neuroimaging research on cross-modal plasticity in adult humans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss and compared it to three claims derived from deafness research. First, cross-modal plasticity is thought to involve both intra-modal strengthening of remaining senses and cross-modal recruitment of deprived cortical areas, but we were unable to identify strong evidence of cross-modal recruitment in adults with partial hearing loss. Second, cross-modal plasticity is believed to arise through top-down connections and implicates cognitive function, which agreed with our findings. Third, cross-modal plasticity is believed to enhance perception in the non-deprived senses. No study in our review supported this claim, but it is possible that cross-modal plasticity in partial hearing loss results in stronger modulation of auditory function by intact senses. In addition, many study outcomes in humans with partial loss were inconsistent. Overall, it may be premature to conclude that cross-modal plasticity operates the same for partial and total forms of sensory loss in humans, and we provide several recommendations for testing these claims in future research.",

      "content": "Medical imaging has become an essential tool for identifying and treating neurological conditions. Traditional deep learning (DL) models have made tremendous advances in neuroimaging analysis; however, they face difficulties when modeling complicated spatiotemporal brain data. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are inspired by real neurons, provide a promising option for efficiently processing spatiotemporal data. This review discusses current improvements in using SNNs for multimodal neuroimaging analysis. Quantitative and thematic analyses were conducted on 21 selected publications to assess trends, research topics, and geographical contributions. Results show that SNNs outperform traditional DL approaches in classification, feature extraction, and prediction tasks, especially when combining multiple modalities. Despite their potential, challenges of multimodal data fusion, computational demands, and limited large-scale datasets persist. We discussed the growth of SNNs in analysis, prediction, and diagnosis of neurological data, along with the emphasis on future direction and improvements for more efficient and clinically applicable models.",
