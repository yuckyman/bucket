      "title": "Local homeostatic scaling supports stable rate propagation under noise and heterogeneity",
      "content": "The brain maintains stable information transmission despite substantial heterogeneity in neuronal properties and noise. Signals must travel across multiple regions with high fidelity without interruption or distortion. Previous studies achieve reliable firing-rate propagation in feedforward circuits only with finely tuned synaptic weights; otherwise, firing rate activity either decays or explodes. How neural circuits self-organize to achieve stable rate propagation without external fine-tuning remains unclear. Here, we introduce a simple, local homeostatic synaptic scaling rule in which each neuron rescales its excitatory inputs based on the mismatch between mean excitatory presynaptic and postsynaptic firing rate. We show both analytically and numerically that this local learning rule enables noisy feedforward networks to spontaneously organize stable rate propagation across layers when driven by external inputs, without the need for global supervision or precise weight initialization. This rule compensates for intrinsic neuronal properties by adjusting synaptic strengths to maintain consistent firing rate transmission, which allows heterogeneous feedforward networks to self-organize to support stable rate propagation. Finally, we show that when combined with homeostatic inhibitory synaptic plasticity, the rule stabilizes attractor firing rate in recurrent networks, preserving an asynchronous-irregular activity under perturbations. Our findings reveal how local plasticity rules support robust neural circuits capable of signal propagation without external fine-tuning, providing mechanistic insights into neurobiological self-organization and principles for designing resilient spiking networks.",

      "title": "The Dominant Hand-Area Network: Task-Signal Mismatch and the Decoupling of BCI Skill from Global Efficiency in Postural Motor Imagery",
      "content": "Rationale: The neurophysiological basis of motor imagery (MI) is foundational to Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) development. While BCI decoding relies on local sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), MI itself is a large-scale network process. It is an open, and clinically critical question whether an individual's BCI decoding skill is related to global network integration. This is complicated when the instructed task (e.g., postural imagery) differs from the underlying neurophysiological signal (e.g., hand-area SMRs). This study investigates the network dynamics of this task-signal mismatch and its relation to BCI performance. Methods: We analyzed a 64-channel EEG dataset of 32 healthy participants (from the OpenNeuro dataset ds005342 cohort) performing a cued motor imagery task (e.g., \"sit-to-stand\") contrasted against an idle state. BCI decoding performance was quantified using a Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) pipeline with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers. We then constructed functional brain networks from the beta (13-30 Hz) band using Phase-Locking Value (PLV) and spectral Granger Causality (GC). Graph theory was employed to analyze network topology, and we correlated individual BCI accuracy with global network efficiency in both sensor and source space. Results: BCI performance was robustly high (LDA (Mean: 82.10% {+/-} 8.80% SD)), 95% CI [78.92%, 85.28%], p < 10-20), confirming a high-fidelity local SMR signal. Strikingly, CSP analysis revealed this signal originated not from the expected leg-area (Cz), but from the hand-area sensorimotor cortex (C3/C4) (See Figure 4). Despite this local-signal fidelity, this decoding skill was critically decoupled from whole-brain network integration, showing no correlation of BCI accuracy with global efficiency, in either sensor space (r (30) = 0.189, p = 0.299) or, more critically, in source space (r (30) = -0.054, p = 0.769, 95% CI [-0.395, 0.300]). Our network analysis, centered on this C3/C4-dominant signal, revealed a novel, hypothetical M1-centric model: the motor cortex (C3/C4) acted as the primary information broadcaster (via GC), driving activity in prefrontal coordinating hubs (F3/Fz). Furthermore, the MI state was characterized by a dynamic reconfiguration, increasing the information-gating centrality of the premotor (FC1) node while suppressing the parietal (P3) node. Conclusion: BCI decoding skill reflects a local process driven by SMR signal fidelity from the dominant hand area--even during non-hand tasks--rather than a global process relying on whole-brain efficiency. We propose a hypothetical \"Broadcasting Motor Cortex\" model in which the MI network is not a simple PFC-M1 hierarchy but a dynamic, M1-centered system that re-routes information through premotor and parietal gateways. Within this framework, baseline network properties may influence skill, but task-evoked global integration does not emerge as a strong correlate of performance. Given that our study was powered only to detect large correlations (r > 0.48), the absence of such effects suggests that baseline network states (16, 17), rather than active global integration, are more likely to predict individual BCI ability.",

      "content": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), exacerbates tau tangles, amyloid plaques, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation -- the pathological hallmarks of AD. While astrocytes are the primary producers of APOE in the CNS, neurons increase APOE expression under stress and aging. Prior work established that neuronal APOE4 is essential for AD pathogenesis, but whether it is sufficient to drive disease remained unknown. We generated a PS19 tauopathy mouse model selectively expressing APOE4 in neurons. Neuronal APOE4 alone proved sufficient to promote pathological tau accumulation and propagation, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation to levels comparable to a tauopathy model with human APOE4 knocked-in globally. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing further revealed similar transcriptomic changes in neurons and glia of both models. Together, these findings demonstrate that neuronal APOE4 alone can initiate and propagate AD pathologies, underscoring its pivotal role in disease pathogenesis and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Oligodendrocytes show enriched expression of amyloid precursor protein and GABA B receptor isoform 1a",
      "content": "Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes proteolytic processing to generate amyloid-{beta}, the main component of amyloid plaques found in brains with Alzheimer's disease. The proteolytic processing of APP also generates soluble APP alpha (sAPPa) which can modulate synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth through the gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABABR). Whether GABABR mediates functions of sAPPa; in other neural cell types such as glia remains unknown. sAPPa; binds the R1a subunit isoform of GABABR1 which contains two sushi domains absent in R1b. It is unclear whether both GABABR1 isoforms are expressed equally across brain cell types. We determined relative RNA levels of the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms in oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons in adult mice using two approaches. We developed a GABABR1 isoform-specific RNAseq analysis workflow to probe a publicly available dataset generated by Zhang et al. (2014). We also isolated five cell types from a single mouse brain and performed RT-qPCR. We show that the GABABR1a and 1b isoforms are differentially expressed among cell types. GABABR1a expression was highest in oligodendrocytes and GABABR1b expression was highest in astrocytes, suggesting that sAPPa-mediated GABABR signaling may be most prominent in oligodendrocytes. We also confirmed that APP is expressed in all five cell types and showed that APP RNA levels are highest in oligodendrocytes. Together, our findings uncover cell type-specific expression of GABABR isoforms and highlight oligodendrocytes as a principal cell type for GABABR1a-mediated APP signaling, providing a foundation for future mechanistic studies.",

      "title": "Dual Activation of MC3R and MC4R Drives Weight Loss and Reduces Food Intake in Obese Primates",
      "content": "The melanocortin system plays a central role in regulating hunger and satiety, making it an attractive target for treating metabolic disease. However, the limited clinical success of selective melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonists prompted the investigation of whether concurrent melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and MC4R activation is key to unlocking the melanocortin system for the treatment of general obesity. To test this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized novel peptides to probe the distinct and combined roles of MC3R and MC4R in nonhuman primates (NHPs). We show that selectively agonizing MC3R modulates food intake in a state-dependent manner. Moreover, co-agonism of MC3R and MC4R results in more substantial metabolic effects than selective MC4R agonism, highlighting both a non-redundant and a cooperative role of MC3R. To leverage these discoveries, we developed 710GO, an orally-available MC3R/MC4R dual agonist peptide that induces significant weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) NHPs. Oral 710GO treatment demonstrates limited weight rebound, has additive effects in combination with GLP-1s, and exhibits a clean safety profile. These results reestablish the melanocortin system, specifically concerted MC3R/MC4R agonism, as a viable mechanism for next-generation obesity therapeutics.",

      "content": "Motor control depends on flexible modulation of beta-band oscillations (15-30 Hz) within cortical-basal ganglia circuits. In Parkinson's disease (PD), beta synchronization becomes pathologically elevated, contributing to motor slowing and rigidity and motivating the need for non-invasive strategies that can suppress excessive beta activity. Transcranial alternating stimulation (tACS) provides a non-invasive approach to modify endogenous oscillatory activity, yet conventional open-loop tACS typically reinforces, rather than disrupts, endogenous synchrony. Here, we developed an online adaptive EEG-guided closed-loop system that continuously tracked the instantaneous beta phase and delivered stimulation either aligned (in-phase) or 180 degrees opposed (anti-phase) to the ongoing beta rhythm. Thirty-eight right-handed healthy participants performed a stop-signal task while receiving 4x1 HD-tACS over pre-supplementary motor cortex (preSMA) in three conditions: in-phase, anti-phase, and sham. Anti-phase tACS produced a robust suppression of beta relative to both in-phase and sham stimulation, consistent with destructive interference of the endogenous rhythm. Behaviorally, anti-phase tACS slowed the stopping process, whereas in-phase stimulation reduced peak force rate during go trials and decreased variability of the go response, consistent with increased inhibitory tone and stabilization of ongoing motor states. These results provide converging behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for destructive interference of anti-phase tACS and establish a mechanistic framework for phase-specific closed-loop neuromodulation, paving the way to implement a noninvasive therapeutic strategy aimed at desynchronizing pathological beta in Parkinson's disease.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot.

As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",
