      "title": "A Framework for Optimizing Human-Machine Interaction in Classification Systems",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05974v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Automated decision systems increasingly rely on human oversight to ensure accuracy in uncertain cases. This paper presents a practical framework for optimizing such human-in-the-loop classification systems using a double-threshold policy. Instead of relying on a single decision cutoff, the system defines two thresholds (a lower and an upper) to automatically accept or reject confident cases while routing ambiguous ones for human review. We formalize this problem as an optimization task that balances system accuracy against human review workload and demonstrate its behavior through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results quantify how different probability score distributions affect the efficiency of human intervention and identify the regions of diminishing returns where additional review yields minimal benefit. The framework provides a general, reproducible method for improving reliability in any decision pipeline requiring selective human validation, including applications in entity resolution, fraud detection, medical triage, and content moderation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05871v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interviews are commonplace in HCI. This paper presents a novel documentary method of interpretation that supports analysis of the topics contained within a collection of transcripts, topics that are endogenous to it and which elaborate participants collective reasoning about issues of relevance to research. We contrast endogenous topic analysis with established qualitative approaches, including content analysis, grounded theory, interpretative phenomenological analysis, and thematic analysis, to draw out the distinctive character of the documentary method of interpretation. Unlike established methods, the DMI does not require that the analyst be proficient in qualitative analysis, or have sound knowledge of underlying theories and methods. The DMI is a members method, not a social science method, that relies on mastery of natural language; a competence most people possess.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05825v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Passive brain-computer interfaces offer a potential source of implicit feedback for alignment of large language models, but most mental state decoding has been done in controlled tasks. This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.",

      "title": "Improving Clinical Data Accessibility Through Automated FHIR Data Transformation Tools",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard has emerged as a widely adopted specification for exchanging structured clinical data across healthcare systems. However, raw FHIR resources are often complex, verbose, and difficult for clinicians and analysts to interpret without specialized tooling. This paper presents a lightweight, browser-based system that improves the accessibility of FHIR data by automatically transforming raw JSON resources into human-readable PDF and Excel reports, along with interactive data visualizations. The system supports both remote retrieval of FHIR resources from server endpoints and the upload of local FHIR JSON files, enabling both online and offline analysis. Using a modular React architecture with jsPDF, xlsx, and Recharts, the tool parses, normalizes, visualizes, and exports FHIR data in an intuitive format. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system enhances interpretability and usability while preserving the semantic integrity of FHIR structures. Limitations and future extensions, including expanded FHIR profile support and clinical validation, are discussed.",

      "title": "SAFE: Secure and Accurate Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Brain-Computer Interfaces",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05789v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely adopted due to their efficiency and portability; however, their decoding algorithms still face multiple challenges, including inadequate generalization, adversarial vulnerability, and privacy leakage. This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.",

      "title": "Advancing credit mobility through stakeholder-informed AI design and adoption",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05666v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Transferring from a 2-year to a 4-year college is crucial for socioeconomic mobility, yet students often face challenges ensuring their credits are fully recognized, leading to delays in their academic progress and unexpected costs. Determining whether courses at different institutions are equivalent (i.e., articulation) is essential for successful credit transfer, as it minimizes unused credits and increases the likelihood of bachelor's degree completion. However, establishing articulation agreements remains time- and resource-intensive, as all candidate articulations are reviewed manually. Although recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence to support this work, its use in articulation practice remains limited. Given these challenges and the need for scalable support, this study applies artificial intelligence to suggest articulations between institutions in collaboration with the State University of New York system, one of the largest systems of higher education in the US. To develop our methodology, we first surveyed articulation staff and faculty to assess adoption rates of baseline algorithmic recommendations and gather feedback on perceptions and concerns about these recommendations. Building on these insights, we developed a supervised alignment method that addresses superficial matching and institutional biases in catalog descriptions, achieving a 5.5-fold improvement in accuracy over previous methods. Based on articulation predictions of this method and a 61% average surveyed adoption rate among faculty and staff, these findings project a 12-fold increase in valid credit mobility opportunities that would otherwise remain unrealized. This study suggests that stakeholder-informed design of AI in higher education administration can expand student credit mobility and help reshape current institutional decision-making in course articulation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05651v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Engaging learners in dialogue around controversial issues is essential for examining diverse values and perspectives in pluralistic societies. While prior research has identified productive discussion moves mainly in STEM-oriented contexts, less is known about what constitutes productive discussion in ethical and value-laden discussions. This study investigates productive discussion in AI ethics dilemmas using a dialogue-centric learning analytics approach. We analyze small-group discussions among undergraduate students through a hybrid method that integrates expert-informed coding with data-driven topic modeling. This process identifies 14 discussion moves across five categories, including Elaborating Ideas, Position Taking, Reasoning & Justifications, Emotional Expression, and Discussion Management. We then examine how these moves relate to discussion quality and analyze sequential interaction patterns using Ordered Network Analysis. Results indicate that emotive and experiential arguments and explicit acknowledgment of ambiguity are strong positive predictors of discussion quality, whereas building on ideas is negatively associated. Ordered Network Analysis further reveals that productive discussions are characterized by interactional patterns that connect emotional expressions to evidence-based reasoning. These findings suggest that productive ethical discussion is grounded not only in reasoning and justification but also in the constructive integration of emotional expression.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05516v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As virtual reality (VR) becomes more widely adopted, secure and efficient text entry is an increasingly critical need. In this paper, we identify a vulnerability in a state-of-the-art secure VR text entry method and introduce a novel virtual radial keyboard designed to achieve a balance between security with usability. Keys are arranged alphabetically in a circular layout, with each key selected by controller rotation and dynamically expanding to facilitate precise selection. A randomized rotation mechanism shifts the keyboard after each keystroke, preserving relative key positions while disrupting absolute spatial mappings to protect against inference attacks. We conducted a within-subject study (N=30) comparing our method with the prior secure technique and a standard QWERTY keyboard. Results showed that the radial keyboard significantly improves resistance to keystroke prediction attacks while incurring a tradeoff in entry speed and subjective workload due to the unfamiliar non-QWERTY layout. However, both quantitative trends and qualitative feedback indicate strong potential for performance improvements with practice. We also discuss design implications, possible interface refinements, and directions for future work, including layout variations and visual enhancements.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05450v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study examines the impact of feedback on Electroencephalography (EEG) activity and performance during the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. In a within-subject design, eleven participants completed the test under Feedback and No-Feedback conditions. Using the principles of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) and Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), we extend these network-based models to explore the link between neural dynamics and task outcomes. ENA results showed that feedback is associated with stronger connections between higher frequency EEG bands (Beta and Gamma) and correct responses, while the absence of feedback activated lower frequency bands (Theta and Alpha). ONA further disclosed directional shifts toward higher frequency activity preceding correct answers in the Feedback condition, whereas the No-Feedback condition showed more self-connections in lower bands and a higher occurrence of wrong answers, suggesting less effective reasoning strategies without feedback. Both ENA and ONA revealed statistically significant differences between conditions (p = 0.01, Cohen's d > 2). This study highlights the methodological benefits of integrating EEG with ENA and ONA for network analysis, capturing both temporal and relational dynamics, as well as the practical insight that feedback can foster more effective reasoning processes and improve task performance.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Neuronal Toll-like Receptor-4 regulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Activity Mediates Dentate Circuit Dysfunction after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "content": "Neuroinflammatory pathways activated by traumatic brain injury (TBI) are critical mediators of long-term neurological dysfunction and represent promising therapeutic targets. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor, was previously shown to contribute to seizure susceptibility and cognitive deficits in rats after lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TLR4-mediated circuit dysfunction early after brain injury is not fully understood. In this study, we define a cell- and circuit- specific neuroimmune-extracellular matrix signaling axis that mediates early post-TBI circuit dysfunction in the hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG). Using ex vivo electrophysiology in rat and mouse models one-week after brain injury, we demonstrate that neuronal TLR4 signaling regulates both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to dentate granule cells (DGC). Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 in rats within 24 hours post-injury and cell-type-specific deletion of TLR4 in glutamatergic neurons in mice demonstrated that injury-driven excitatory circuit dysfunction is mediated by neuronal TLR4 and relies on downstream activation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an enzyme critical for extracellular matrix remodeling. In contrast, TLR4-dependent alterations in inhibitory inputs occurred independent of MMP-9, revealing a mechanistic divergence. Early inhibition of either TLR4 signaling or MMP-9 activity in rats within 24 hours post-injury reduced network hyperexcitability, improved long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus measured in vivo one-week after injury, and attenuated long-term deficits in spatial memory one-month post-injury. Furthermore, we demonstrate a context-dependent role for TLR4 signaling contributing to circuit homeostasis in the uninjured brain and driving circuit dysfunction in the injured brain. Together, these results identify a novel TLR4 -MMP-9 axis as a key driver of early post-TBI dentate gyrus circuit dysfunction and behavioral deficits.",

      "content": "This perspective article explores the transformative potential of brain\u2013Computer Interfaces (BCI) in undergraduate systems engineering programs, a domain characterized by high attrition and a widening gap between rapid technological innovation and slower pedagogical change. I argue that BCI, by enabling real-time detection of cognitive states such as mental workload, attention, and frustration, can evolve from laboratory tools to central pedagogical instruments for adaptive, student-centered education. I review the state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrate the technical feasibility of low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) devices and machine learning algorithms that classify cognitive states with high accuracy in controlled settings. Building on this evidence, I outline concrete applications in three dimensions: formative assessment, dynamic curricular adaptation, and cognitive inclusion, with a specific emphasis on preventing dropout in foundational courses such as algorithms. I also examine ethical, technical, and pedagogical challenges, and propose a scalable, ethically grounded pilot model tailored for universities, particularly in Latin America. This study reports no empirical results. It synthesizes the existing evidence and proposes a roadmap for research and educational action.",

      "title": "Humans optimally integrate cutaneous and proprioceptive cues in haptic size perception",
      "content": "Sensory perception relies on the brain's integration of multiple imprecise inputs, a process known as cue combination. Previous research has investigated multisensory integration or unisensory integration within non-haptic senses. In contrast, cue combination within the sense of touch has been understudied. Here, we investigated whether humans optimally combine haptic cutaneous and finger configuration cues when discerning the size of a disk held edge-on between the thumb and index fingers. When these two fingers span the disk to contact its perimeter, a finger configuration cue (the perceived distance between the fingers) provides information about the disk's size. Less obviously, cutaneous cues to disk size may result from the indentation of finger pads caused by the disk's curvature. We considered three hypotheses for how humans might use these cues: they might rely solely on the most reliable cue (Winner-Take-All Model, WTA), combine cues based on a simple arithmetic average (Average Model, AVG), or combine cues via an optimal weighted average (Optimal Model, OPT) in which more reliable cues exert proportionately greater influence on the percept. In three experiments involving 34 participants, we compared participant performance to the predictions of the three models. Each experiment tested participants using a two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) paradigm with 3D printed disk stimuli. On each trial, under occluded vision, participants felt two disks sequentially and responded which felt larger. Participants were tested with the cutaneous index finger cue, cutaneous thumb cue, and finger configuration cue individually and with the three cues together. The three experiments were designed to have progressively greater resolution to distinguish the relevant models from one another. In Experiments 1 and 2, the disks were circular. Experiment 3 included non-circular cue-conflict stimuli. The improvement of accuracy in multi-cue conditions, and perceptual effects of cue-conflict stimuli, were broadly consistent with optimal cue combination. Eight of 12 participants were classified as OPT in Experiment 1; eight of 11 in Experiment 2; and 10 of 11 in Experiment 3. The mean confidence of OPT classifications was 0.56, 0.61, and 0.98, respectively. We conclude that humans combine haptic cues optimally to judge the sizes of held objects.",

      "title": "Non-linearity, complexity, and quantization concepts in biology",
      "content": "Founders of quantum mechanics (QM) anticipated that revisions to classical physics due to strange elements of quantum reality, would necessitate similar changes in biology. Complexity theory, systems biology and quantum biology provide possible solutions indicating that subject/object separation is a useful fiction for reductive science. Direct correlates to such QM observational/measurement issues as Complementarity and Uncertainty may justify the introduction of an analog of Heisenberg's uncertainty and the Planck constant for living systems. The phase space of \u201cadjacent possibles\u201d for biological systems from which one \u201cactual\u201d is selected resembles the collapse of the QM wave function. Since biological systems are hierarchical, this occurs across organizational scales resulting in biological coherence. The location of a quantum/classical boundary is unclear due to complexity. Whether biological systems' characteristics arise directly from QM or are of a different origin remains unsettled. To combine non-linear with quantum properties across biological scales we propose the Method of Coherent Structures (MCS), developed for quantum many-body systems. In MCS, a higher-level scale provides a classical envelope for quantum fluctuations at the lower scale. It yields a seamless transition from non-linear classical fields to quantum excitations and accounts for the emergence of complexity by incorporating metabolic energy supply.",

      "content": "BackgroundBalance impairment following stroke is a leading cause of disability and falls. Hemoglobin (Hb) affects systemic and cerebral oxygen delivery and may influence neuromuscular function and post-stroke balance, but evidence from large multicenter clinical samples is limited. We investigated the association between hemoglobin concentration and balance performance in a Chinese multicenter cross-sectional study of stroke patients.MethodsWe studied 2,006 neuroimaging-confirmed stroke patients from 26 hospitals. Balance impairment was defined as BBS\u202f\u2264\u202f40. Admission Hb (g/dL) was analyzed per 1\u202fg/dL and by tertiles (<12.6\u202fg/dL, 12.6\u201314.0\u202fg/dL, \u226514.0\u202fg/dL). Multivariable logistic regression with sequential adjustment, restricted cubic splines, and prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses evaluated associations.ResultsBalance impairment occurred in 70.5% (1,414/2,006). Each 1\u202fg/dL higher Hb was associated with lower odds of impairment in unadjusted (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78\u20130.87; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and fully adjusted models (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83\u20130.96; p\u202f=\u202f0.002). This association remained robust after comprehensive adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, stroke characteristics, and lesion location factors. Compared with the lowest tertile, adjusted ORs were 0.72 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.99; p\u202f=\u202f0.042) for the middle tertile and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45\u20130.85; p\u202f=\u202f0.003) for the highest tertile. Spline analyses suggested a broadly linear inverse association; results were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity checks.ConclusionHigher admission hemoglobin was independently associated with better balance after stroke. Prospective studies should test whether Hb optimization improves rehabilitation outcomes.",
