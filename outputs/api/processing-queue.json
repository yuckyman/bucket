      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone</p> <p>A while ago <a href=\"https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk\">binwalk</a> made a complete shift to rust and stopped supporting its pypi releases. I needed to use binwalk through python for a different project which didn't allow me to spawn a separate process and run binwalk (or install it). So, subprocesses was out of question.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>I made a <a href=\"https://github.com/FauvidoTechnologies/binwalk-python-sdk\">library</a> after I achieved some preliminary functionality (which is today) and decided to post it in case someone else also was searching for something like this.</p> <p>There is a long way to go, I am going to try and replicate every functionality of binwalk which I can, so far I have a basic `scan` and `extract`. Its pip installable and I hope its useful for you all as well!</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Anyone who's interested in performing binwalk functions through a simple python interface.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>The existing projects are either not a python library or they're broken or they are running binwalk as a subprocess. I couldn't afford any of those so I made sure that this one doesn't do that.</p> <p>Right now it doesn't have much functionality except scan and extract as I mentioned before, but I am also actively developing this so there will be more in the future</p> <p>Thank you for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Sky6805\"> /u/Ok-Sky6805 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1phqpqy/built_a_python_library_for_using_binwalk/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1phqpqy/built_a_python_library_for_using_binwalk/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Enhanced ex vivo 3D whole-brain mapping and automated analysis of Parkinson's disease pathologies in mice",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates, which are thought to drive neurodegeneration in vulnerable neuronal populations, particularly within the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Here, we aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship between -syn aggregation and dopaminergic cell degeneration by developing an optimized analysis pipeline for efficient whole-brain mapping. We injected -syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of wild-type mice, using monomeric -syn-injected mice as the control group. Aggregate propagation and dopaminergic degeneration were analyzed using antibodies against phosphorylated -syn (pS129) and tyrosine hydroxylase, followed by brain clearing combined with high-resolution (<4 m) light-sheet microscopy (LSM), coupled with automated pipeline data analysis. Whole-brain LSM mapping revealed dense somatic and neuritic phosphorylated -syn aggregates within dopaminergic neurons of the SNc 12 weeks post-unilateral PFF injection, accompanied by significant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and prion-like propagation -syn aggregates to anatomically connected brain regions, including the striatum. The distribution pattern of -syn pathology visualized by LSM was validated by whole-brain immunohistochemical analysis of PFF-injected mouse brains. The 3D LSM approach introduced here uniquely captures the spatial organization and propagation of -syn pathology and dopaminergic degeneration across interconnected brain networks.",

      "title": "Preoptic Neurons that Regulate Hibernation Entry",
      "content": "Seasonal hibernation allows species to survive harsh environments by entering a profound hypometabolic and hypothermic state called deep torpor (DT). However, the neural mechanisms controlling entry into this state remain poorly understood. Here, we map neuronal activity across hibernation stages in the Syrian hamster and identify DT-associated activity in the hypothalamic anterior preoptic area (aPOA) as essential for hibernation entry. Single-nucleus multiomic profiling enabled the design of a novel enhancer adeno-associated virus selectively targeting candidate glutamatergic neuronal subpopulations. Using this tool, we demonstrate that activity of a subpopulation of Samd3-positive glutamatergic neurons in the hamster aPOA is both necessary and sufficient for DT induction. Together, our findings identify a neuronal population regulating hibernation entry and provide the first genetic access to manipulate this complex behavior.",

This catches API keys that don't match known formats (like generic random tokens) by flagging high-entropy strings.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft Presidio:</strong> I integrated Presidio\u2019s NLP engine to catch PII like names and emails in comments.</li> <li><strong>Context-Aware Placeholders:</strong> It swaps secrets for tags like <code>&lt;AWS_KEY_1&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;SECRET_VAR_ASSIGNMENT_2&gt;</code>, so the LLM understands <em>what</em> the data is without <em>seeing</em> it.</li> </ol> <p><strong>How it works (Comparison):</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Sanitize:</strong> You highlight code -&gt; The Python script analyzes it locally -&gt; Swaps secrets for placeholders -&gt; Saves a map in memory.</li> <li><strong>Prompt:</strong> You paste the safe code into ChatGPT/Claude.</li> <li><strong>Restore:</strong> You paste the AI's fix back into your editor -&gt; The script uses the memory map to inject the original secrets back into the new code.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> </p> <ul> <li> Anyone who uses code with sensitive information paired with AI.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Python 3.11 (Core Engine)</li> <li>TypeScript (VS Code Extension Interface)</li> <li>Spacy / Presidio (NLP)</li> </ul> <p><strong>I need your feedback:</strong> This is currently a v1.0 Proof of Concept.
