      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "Closed-loop coupling of both physiological spindle model and spinal pathways for sensorimotor control of human center-out reaching",
      "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

      "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

      "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
      "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

      "title": "Glioma neuron symbiosis: a hypothesis",
      "content": "Glioma cells, just like all cancerous cells, consume substantial amounts of glucose for their energy needs, using glycolysis, an inefficient metabolic pathway (Warburg effect) to produce only two moles of adenosine triphosphate and two moles of lactate for each mole of glucose consumed. By contrast, neurons consume glucose via glycolysis and utilize its end-product lactate as the substrate of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle and its coupled oxidative phosphorylation, a process eighteen times more efficient at adenosine triphosphate than glycolysis alone. It hypothesizes here that glioma-produced lactate is the preferred oxidative energy substrate of their surrounding neurons. Consequently, by using lactate, neurons bypass glycolysis, sparing their glucose and making it readily available for the glucose-craving cancer cells. Moreover, glioma cells\u2019 ability to secrete glutamate, which excites glutamatergic neurons, could drive the latter to consume even more lactate, sparing more glucose. Such symbiotic exchange, especially at the initial stages of malignancy, assures the budding cancer cells an ample glucose supply ahead of the development of additional vasculature. While this hypothesis focuses on gliomas, it may also apply to other cancer types.",

      "title": "The CB1 receptor: linking impulsivity and substance use disorder",
      "content": "The cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) is the most widely expressed G protein-coupled receptor in the brain, with high concentrations in the basal ganglia, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Predominantly localized in presynaptic terminals, CB1R modulates synaptic transmission through retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Its expression follows an ontogenetic trajectory, with region- and age-specific patterns that are particularly dynamic during adolescence. This developmental window is characterized by marked neuroplasticity and heightened impulsivity, a trait closely associated with increased vulnerability to substance use disorders (SUDs). While the prefrontal cortex has traditionally been viewed as the primary locus of self-control, growing evidence supports a broader regulatory network involving CB1R-rich subcortical structures. In particular, the hippocampus and cerebellum contribute to the modulation of impulsive behavior through their connectivity with prefrontal and limbic circuits. CB1R signaling in these regions influences decision-making, reward sensitivity, and response inhibition\u2014all processes critical to the emergence of impulsive traits and drug-seeking behavior. This review integrates preclinical and clinical evidence to propose a distributed CB1R-regulated neurocircuit that underlies impulsivity and mediates risk for SUDs. We highlight adolescence as a critical period during which CB1R ontogeny may transiently unbalance inhibitory control systems, creating a neurobiological substrate for risky behaviors. Furthermore, we identify key knowledge gaps, including the underexplored ontogeny of CB1R in the cerebellum and its functional implications in addiction vulnerability. Understanding the dynamic role of CB1R across development and brain regions offers a more comprehensive model of impulsivity and its pathological escalation into substance use. This perspective may inform translational strategies targeting the endocannabinoid system for early prevention.",

It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.25537v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As teenagers increasingly turn to social media for health-related information, understanding the values of teen-targeted content has become important. Although videos on healthy lifestyles and self-improvement are gaining popularity on social media platforms like YouTube, little is known about how these videos benefit and engage with teenage viewers. To address this, we conducted a thematic analysis of 44 YouTube videos and 66,901 comments. We found that these videos provide various advice on teenagers' common challenges, use engaging narratives for authenticity, and foster teen-centered communities through comments. However, a few videos also gave misleading advice to adolescents that can be potentially harmful. Based on our findings, we discuss design implications for creating relatable and intriguing social media content for adolescents. Additionally, we suggest ways for social media platforms to promote healthier and safer experiences for teenagers.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.25513v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational AI, such as ChatGPT, is increasingly used for information seeking. However, little is known about how ordinary users actually prompt and how ChatGPT adapts its responses in real-world conversational information seeking (CIS). In this study, a nationally representative sample of 937 U.S. adults engaged in multi-turn CIS with ChatGPT on both controversial and non-controversial topics across science, health, and policy contexts. We analyzed both user prompting strategies and the communication styles of ChatGPT responses. The findings revealed behavioral signals of digital divide: only 19.1% of users employed prompting strategies, and these users were disproportionately more educated and Democrat-leaning. Further, ChatGPT demonstrated contextual adaptation: responses to controversial topics contain more cognitive complexity and more external references than to non-controversial topics. Notably, cognitively complex responses were perceived as less favorable but produced more positive issue-relevant attitudes. This study highlights disparities in user prompting behaviors and shows how user prompts and AI responses together shape information-seeking with conversational AI.",

      "title": "XR Blocks: Accelerating Human-centered AI + XR Innovation",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.25504v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We are on the cusp where Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Extended Reality (XR) are converging to unlock new paradigms of interactive computing. However, a significant gap exists between the ecosystems of these two fields: while AI research and development is accelerated by mature frameworks like JAX and benchmarks like LMArena, prototyping novel AI-driven XR interactions remains a high-friction process, often requiring practitioners to manually integrate disparate, low-level systems for perception, rendering, and interaction. To bridge this gap, we present XR Blocks, a cross-platform framework designed to accelerate human-centered AI + XR innovation. XR Blocks strives to provide a modular architecture with plug-and-play components for core abstraction in AI + XR: user, world, peers; interface, context, and agents. Crucially, it is designed with the mission of \"reducing frictions from idea to reality\", thus accelerating rapid prototyping of AI + XR apps. Built upon accessible technologies (WebXR, three.js, TensorFlow, Gemini), our toolkit lowers the barrier to entry for XR creators. We demonstrate its utility through a set of open-source templates, samples, and advanced demos, empowering the community to quickly move from concept to interactive XR prototype.

      "content": "arXiv:2509.25499v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human-AI interaction researchers face an overwhelming challenge: synthesizing insights from thousands of empirical studies to understand how AI impacts people and inform effective design. Existing approach for literature reviews cluster papers by similarities, keywords or citations, missing the crucial cause-and-effect relationships that reveal how design decisions impact user outcomes. We introduce the Atlas of Human-AI Interaction, an interactive web interface that provides the first systematic mapping of empirical findings across 1,000+ HCI papers using LLM-powered knowledge extraction. Our approach identifies causal relationships, and visualizes them through an AI-enabled interactive web interface as a navigable knowledge graph. We extracted 2,037 empirical findings, revealing research topic clusters, common themes, and disconnected areas. Expert evaluation with 20 researchers revealed the system's effectiveness for discovering research gaps. This work demonstrates how AI can transform literature synthesis itself, offering a scalable framework for evidence-based design, opening new possibilities for computational meta-science across HCI and beyond.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.25492v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI agents, or bots, serve important roles in online communities. However, they are often designed by outsiders or a few tech-savvy members, leading to bots that may not align with the broader community's needs. How might communities collectively shape the behavior of community bots? We present Botender, a system that enables communities to collaboratively design LLM-powered bots without coding. With Botender, community members can directly propose, iterate on, and deploy custom bot behaviors tailored to community needs. Botender facilitates testing and iteration on bot behavior through case-based provocations: interaction scenarios generated to spark user reflection and discussion around desirable bot behavior. A validation study found these provocations more useful than standard test cases for revealing improvement opportunities and surfacing disagreements. During a five-day deployment across six Discord servers, Botender supported communities in tailoring bot behavior to their specific needs, showcasing the usefulness of case-based provocations in facilitating collaborative bot design.",
