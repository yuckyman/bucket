      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "title": "A study on the dreams of Miao and Han college students in Guizhou Province.",
      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "The Oneiric Circle and the Misioneros del Temporal in Morelos, Mexico.",
      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "title": "OpenXstim: an open-source programmable electrical stimulator for transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation therapy",
      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide. The design and complete source-code of the stimulator are freely available online in a public repository: https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXstim",

      "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
      "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports.

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Coordinated multilaminar dynamics underlie multiplexed computation in motor cortex",
      "content": "Functional multiplexing is a signature of higher-order brain regions. Beyond single-unit mixed selectivity, the six-layered cortical microcircuit has been proposed as an optimal substrate for such parallel computations. Recurrent connections within and across layers allow cortical columns to retain incoming information for some time and integrate it into stable latent representations, thereby acting as functional units. The key question is whether the multiplexing capacity arises from specialized processing within individual layers or the collective coordination of multi-layer activity patterns. Here, we analyzed laminar recordings from the motor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a complex delayed match-to-sample task. We identified laminarly distributed, behaviorally specific subspaces that captured the encoding of distinct task-related variables. These subspaces, spanning the entire column and expressed as coordinated activity patterns, were functionally reused to encode the same variable over time and flexibly recycled to encode new ones. Subtle variations of laminar weights gave rise to multiple coexistent laminar coding subspaces, enabling multiplexing at the columnar level. Task-related information propagated across layers in temporally organized trajectories that transiently localized in superficial or deep layers at distinct trial epochs. These organized laminar trajectories were consistently observed across recording sites, but exhibited site-specific propagation patterns. The activity of the population on the other hand lacked structured dynamics. Thus, laminar trajectories of information emerged atop a background of spatially and temporally unspecific activity-fluctuations.",

      "content": "The use of multiple languages modulates the neural mechanisms of selective attention, but it is unclear whether these adaptations require continuous engagement and active second language usage. Here we examined whether language usage shapes selective attention in bilingualism, and what neural processes might this engage. 48 highly proficient English-French bilinguals listened to naturalistic speech streams in their first or second language, paired with either linguistic and non-linguistic interference. Participants were matched on their L2 proficiency, but were either Active, Moderate, or Inactive users of their second language. The results revealed usage-related modulation of oscillatory activity in the alpha band, with more efficient inhibitory control in Active and Moderate users leading to behavioural resilience to interference. In contrast, usage did not affect lower-level perceptual tracking of speech, as captured by mTRF decoding of speech envelopes across frequency bands. Taken together, our findings show that resilience to interference during language processing is not dependent on the perceptual speech tracking, but rather on the capacity to recruit higher-level attentional control mechanisms, a process that is dynamically shaped by bilinguals L2 usage.",
