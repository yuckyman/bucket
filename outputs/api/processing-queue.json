      "title": "The Interactive Effects of Negative Emotion and Reward Motivation on Visual Perception",
      "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

      "title": "Suppressive Interactions between Nearby Stimuli in Visual Cortex Reflect Crowding",
      "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

      "content": "Haptic wearables provide an intuitive human-machine interface to convey information through the sense of touch, which may have promising applications in guided breathing. In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

      "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
      "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

      "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

      "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

      "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
      "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

      "title": "Neonatal social communication and single genes predict the variability of post-pubertal social behavior in a mouse model of paternal 15q11-13 duplication",
      "content": "Mental illnesses associated with high-risk copy number variations (CNVs) are characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable severity, with their underlying mechanisms remaining inadequately understood. We hypothesized that such phenotypic variability is evident from the neonatal stage and is, at least in part, attributable to individual differences in the expression levels of CNV-encoded genes in the brain. We conducted an analysis of the quantitative and functional structure of neonatal social communication, assessed post-pubertal social interaction, and evaluated the brain expression levels of genes within the same cohort of a mouse model of paternal human 15q11-13 duplication, a high-risk factor variably associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Subsequently, computational methods were utilized to identify predictive variables for the variability of post-pubertal social interaction. Mice harboring the 15q11-13 duplication exhibited distinctive call sequences characterized by diverse connections, which lacked the incentive value necessary for effective social communication with mother mice. The neonatal call sequences and the expression levels of Magel2, along with, to a lesser extent, Herc2 and Ndn, in the prefrontal cortex of the 15q11-13 duplication model were predictive of post-pubertal social interaction. Our findings demonstrate that variability in post-pubertal social interaction, a dimensional characteristic of neurodevelopmental disorders, can be predicted by the variability of neonatal social communication and is influenced by the expression levels of specific CNV-encoded genes in the prefrontal cortex. This computational approach has the potential to predict the developmental trajectories of various dimensions of mental illness among CNV carriers in humans and to identify CNV-encoded driver genes in preclinical models, thereby providing potential mechanistic bases for the development of gene-based therapeutic strategies",
