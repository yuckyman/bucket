      "title": "Show HN: I built a clipboard tool to strip/keep specific formatting like Italics",
      "content": "<p>Hello HN,<p>I\u2019m Joseph, a solo developer. I built CustomPaste because I was frustrated by the binary choice standard clipboard tools give us: either keep all the messy formatting (background colors, huge fonts) or strip everything down to plain text.<p>We all know Ctrl+Shift+V (paste as plain text), but that is often too destructive, it kills hyperlinks, bolding, and lists when I usually just want to normalize the font family (e.g., force Arial 11pt) or remove background colors.<p>I wanted a tool that let me \"strip exactly what I want, and keep exactly what I want.\"<p>The Solution: Instead of a single \"paste\" behavior, the app lets you create reusable \"Recipes\" to define exactly how your text should land in your editor. It intercepts the clipboard, processes the structure locally, and transforms it based on your rules.<p>It offers granular control over:<p><pre><code>    Smart Preservation: You can strip or set specific font families and sizes but specifically preserve bold, italics, and hyperlinks.\n</code></pre>\nStructure: You can preserve tables while stripping the images inside them.<p>Data Cleanup: It can instantly purge duplicate lines, sort lists alphabetically, or flatten extra blank lines.<p>Text Fixes: It cleans up AI-generated artifacts (like \"smart quotes\" or em-dashes) and enforces casing (Title Case, Sentence Case).<p>Privacy & Pricing: The app runs 100% locally on your machine, no cloud processing and no data harvesting. It is a one-time purchase (lifetime license), not a subscription. There is a free trial (first 100 pastes) so you can test if it fits your workflow.<p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the \"Recipe\" approach or any other edge cases you struggle with when pasting text!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46463992</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

      "title": "Transcriptional Heterogeneity Reveals a Synaptic Gene Program in Developing and Adult Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells",
      "content": "Human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) arise early in gestation and expand broadly during cortical development, yet the extent of their heterogeneity remains poorly defined. Here, we isolated >2,300 highly pure OPCs from post-conceptional week (PCW) 17 human cortex using an optimized PDGFR-based immunopanning and performed single-cell RNA sequencing. Unsupervised clustering revealed four transcriptionally distinct embryonic OPC subsets, including a previously unrecognized population that expressed genes linked to synaptic development, synaptic signaling, and neuromodulation. This subset - designated embryonic synaptic OPCs (eSyn-OPCs) - comprised approximately 28.5% of all embryonic OPCs in the cortex and was characterized by robust expression of synapse-associated secreted factors (THBS2, WNT5A, WNT7A, PLAT, ACHE) and multiple neurotransmitter receptor subunits. Histological analyses across PCW 12-22 demonstrated that eSyn-OPCs first appear around PCW 15 and are enriched in proliferative germinal zones. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed their localization near neural stem and progenitor cells, suggesting proximal neuron-OPC communication during early cortical assembly. Purified eSyn-OPCs differentiated into mature oligodendrocytes in vitro, confirming their oligodendrocyte lineage identity. Reanalysis of adult human single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets uncovered a transcriptionally analogous OPC subset (adult synaptic OPCs, aSyn-OPCs), though with reduced representation of structural synaptic genes and neurotransmitter receptor diversity compared to eSyn-OPCs. Together, these results identify a synaptically specialized OPC population in both developing and adult human cortex and reveal that eSyn-OPCs possess unexpectedly rich synaptic signaling machinery. These findings suggest that human OPCs may participate directly in neuron-glia communication during early cortical development and raise the possibility of developmental stage-specific roles for eSyn-OPCs in shaping neural circuit formation.",
