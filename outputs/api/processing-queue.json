      "title": "Kilohertz-rate two-photon voltage imaging of population dynamics in vivo",
      "content": "Understanding how neural circuits compute requires capturing voltage dynamics across large neuronal populations with millisecond resolution in vivo. However, two-photon voltage imaging remains fundamentally limited by a trade-off among imaging speed, field of view, and excitation efficiency. We introduce HS2PM, a hybrid scanning two-photon microscope that overcomes this bottleneck, enabling kilohertz-rate imaging over a 650x524 m2 field of view at single-cell resolution while preserving the photon efficiency of single-point excitation. HS2PM stably records deep-layer membrane potentials from over 160 neurons simultaneously, with minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity. It resolves both spikes and subthreshold voltage dynamics in vivo, revealing how these jointly shape sensory adaptation and population coding. Beyond voltage imaging, HS2PM supports high-speed fluorescence lifetime and vascular flow imaging, establishing a multimodal platform for dissecting fast circuit dynamics with precision previously inaccessible to optical methods.",

      "title": "From movement to cognitive maps: recurrent neural networks reveal how locomotor development shapes hippocampal spatial coding",
      "content": "The hippocampus contains neurons whose firing correlates with an animal's location and orientation in space. Collectively, these neurons are held to support a cognitive map of the environment, enabling the recall of and navigation to specific locations. Although recent studies have characterised the timelines of spatial neuron development, no unifying mechanistic model has yet been proposed. Moreover, the processes driving the emergence of spatial representations in the hippocampus remain unclear (Tan et al., 2017). Here, we combine computational analysis of postnatal locomotor development with a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of hippocampal function to demonstrate how changes in movement statistics -- and the resulting sensory experiences -- shape the formation of spatial tuning. First, we identify distinct developmental stages in rat locomotion during open-field exploration using published experimental data. Then, we train shallow RNNs to predict upcoming visual stimuli from concurrent visual and vestibular inputs, exposing them to trajectories that reflect progressively maturing locomotor patterns. Our findings reveal that these changing movement statistics drive the sequential emergence of spatially tuned units, mirroring the developmental timeline observed in rats. The models generate testable predictions about how spatial tuning properties mature -- predictions we confirm through analysis of hippocampal recordings. Critically, we demonstrate that replicating the specific statistics of developmental locomotion -- rather than merely accelerating sensory change -- is essential for the emergence of an allocentric spatial representation. These results establish a mechanistic link between embodied sensorimotor experience and the ontogeny of hippocampal spatial neurons, with significant implications for neurodevelopmental research and predictive models of navigational brain circuits.",

      "title": "Type 2 diabetes Reprograms Bone Marrow Hematopoiesis and Dysregulates Immune Signaling in Response to Stroke",
      "content": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worsens stroke outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms linking T2DM to systemic immune dysfunction remain unclear. We investigated whether T2DM alters bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and dysregulate immune signaling following ischemic stroke in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing, GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP), nCounter, and flow cytometry were used to analyze BM cells from control (db/+, Ctrl) and diabetic (db/db, T2DM) mice underwent experimental stroke or sham surgery. Diabetes caused marked structural remodeling of BM, with reduced cellularity and imbalance of hematopoietic lineages. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed impaired differentiation and maturation signatures of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and granulocytes, and overactivation toward monocytes in diabetes after stroke. CellChat analysis demonstrated reorganization of intercellular communication, with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and monocytes emerging as dominant signaling hubs through upregulated MIF, SIRP, and THBS pathways. AUCell enrichment indicated increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation but reduced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, reflecting metabolic activation coupled with immune dysregulation. DSP and nCounter further confirmed upregulation of genes in the MIF, SIRP and THBS pathways in CD115 monocytes and Ly6G neutrophils, indicating proinflammatory and migratory activation in diabetic bone marrow. Our data suggest that T2DM reprograms hematopoiesis and signaling networks, leading to maladaptive myeloid responses and impaired immune regulation after stroke. This maladaptive BM environment amplifies inflammation and limits repair, linking diabetic metabolic stress to worsened ischemic outcomes. Targeting bone marrow immune dysfunction may offer a therapeutic strategy to improve stroke recovery in diabetic patients.",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",
