      "title": "Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (PTPR\u03ba) regulates Superior ON-Direction Selective Ganglion Cell development, facilitating image stabilization",
      "content": "In vertebrates, gaze stabilization during global visual motion requires ON direction-selective ganglion cells (oDSGCs) in the Accessory Optic System (AOS) to drive the optokinetic reflex (OKR). Three types of oDSGCs form independent mosaics; however, the mechanisms that specify and maintain their numbers to create these mosaics during development remain unknown. Here, we identify protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type kappa (Ptprk) as a key regulator of Superior oDSGC density, the subtype tuned to upward motion. High-depth single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) reveals that Ptprk is selectively enriched in Superior oDSGCs compared to Inferior oDSGCs, which detect downward motion. Genetic deletion of Ptprk selectively halves the number of Superior oDSGCs while preserving the number of Inferior oDSGCs. Anatomically, Superior oDSGCs in Ptprk mutants exhibit compensatory neurite remodeling to preserve mosaics. Physiologically, oDSGCs have broader tuning curves, and a subset of Superior oDSGCS have aberrant preferred directions in Ptprk mutants. Postsynaptically, loss of Ptprk reduces oDSGC connectivity to central targets. Behaviorally, the OKR responses to upward motion are attenuated in both global and pan-retinal Ptprk mutants, confirming a retinal role for Ptprk in upward image stabilization. Together, these findings demonstrate that the density of a retinal ganglion cell type is under molecular control, and that reducing density drives neurite remodeling, alters circuit computation, and ultimately impairs visually-guided behavior.",

Production-ready with test coverage, cost controls, and data validation. Can be used as a CLI tool or imported as a Python package.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Commercial alternatives cost \u20ac500+/month and lock data in the cloud. This is the first free, open-source alternative that runs locally. Unlike generic PDF parsers, this handles both structured (tables) and unstructured (narrative) financial data in one pipeline.</p> <p><strong>Technical Details</strong></p> <ul> <li>pandas for data manipulation</li> <li>pdfplumber for PDF parsing</li> <li>litellm for unified LLM access across 6 providers</li> <li>pytest for testing (15 tests, core functionality covered)</li> <li>Built-in cost estimation before API calls</li> </ul> <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p> <p>Fallback architecture where standard parsing attempts first, then AI for complex documents.</p> <p>MIT licensed.

Lets face it, it is an acquired taste. After a year working with Python my joy of building we apps is back something that I had somewhat lost with my long good friend PHP. I'm not going to fully switch. Never done that before will never do that now. For me languages is a tool, nothing more than that, but is good to be using a tool that brings you joy every now and then.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mcloide\"> /u/mcloide </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6f59a/python_brought_me_joy_back_on_building_web_apps/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6f59a/python_brought_me_joy_back_on_building_web_apps/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "I built Embex: A Universal Vector Database ORM with a Rust core for 2-3x faster vector operations",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Embex is a universal ORM for vector databases. It provides a unified Python API to interact with multiple vector store providers (currently Qdrant, Pinecone, Chroma, LanceDB, Milvus, Weaviate, and PgVector).</p> <p>Under the hood, it is not just a Python wrapper. I implemented the core logic in <strong>Rust</strong> using the &quot;BridgeRust&quot; framework I developed. This Rust core is compiled into a Python extension module using <strong>PyO3</strong>.</p> <p>This architecture allows Embex to perform heavy vector math operations (like cosine similarity and dot products) using SIMD intrinsics (AVX2/NEON) directly in the Rust layer, which are then exposed to Python. This results in vector operations that are roughly <strong>4x faster</strong> than standard scalar implementations, while keeping the Python API idiomatic and simple.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This library is designed for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>AI/ML Engineers</strong> building RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines who want to switch between vector databases (e.g., local LanceDB/Chroma for dev, Pinecone for prod) without rewriting their data access layer.</li> <li><strong>Backend Developers</strong> who need a consistent interface for vector storage that doesn't lock them into a single vendor's SDK.</li> <li><strong>Performance enthusiasts</strong> looking for Python tools that leverage Rust for low-level optimization.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>vs. Native SDKs (e.g.,</strong> <code>pinecone-client</code><strong>,</strong> <code>qdrant-client</code><strong>):</strong> Native SDKs are tightly coupled to their specific backend. If you start with one and want to migrate to another, you have to rewrite your query logic. Embex abstracts this; you change the provider configuration, and your <code>search</code> or <code>insert</code> code remains exactly the same.</li> <li><strong>vs. LangChain VectorStores:</strong> LangChain is a massive framework where the vector store is just one small part of a huge ecosystem. Embex is a standalone, lightweight ORM focused solely on the database layer. It is less opinionated about your overall application architecture and significantly lighter to install if you don't need the rest of LangChain.</li> <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Because the vector operations happen in the compiled Rust core using SIMD instructions, Embex benchmarks at 3.6x - 4.0x faster for mathematical vector operations compared to pure Python or non-SIMD implementations.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Links &amp; Source</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust\">https://github.com/bridgerust/bridgerust</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong> <code>pip install embex</code></li> <li><strong>Docs:</strong><a href=\"https://bridgerust.dev/embex/introduction\">https://bridgerust.dev/embex/introduction</a></li> </ul> <p>I would love feedback on the API design or the PyO3 bindings implementation!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent-Dance-34\"> /u/Maleficent-Dance-34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q6aukm/i_built_embex_a_universal_vector_database_orm/\">[comments]</a></span>",
