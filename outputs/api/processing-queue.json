      "title": "Reliability and validity of multi-band multi-echo fMRI",
      "content": "Precision mapping of individual differences in human brain spontaneous activity is critical for characterizing brain function and guiding clinical translation. Multi-echo resting-state functional MRI (ME-rfMRI) has the potential to provide more reliable mapping of inter-individual differences in intrinsic brain function than conventional single-echo rfMRI (SE-rfMRI). However, the psychometric benefits of ME-rfMRI for mapping individual differences in spontaneous brain activity (SBA) have not been systematically investigated, which is fundamental for understanding the human brain in health and disease. To quantify the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI in precisely mapping inter-individual variations in SBA, we employed a psychometric design. We scanned 27 healthy adults with both ME-rfMRI and SE-rfMRI to assess short-term (minutes) test-retest reliability, as well as validity across eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting states. Our results demonstrate that ME-rfMRI improves reliability relative to SE-rfMRI by 10.8% for amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), 4.4% for regional homogeneity (ReHo), and 8.0% for voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) in cortical regions, and by 12.5% for ALFF, 8.3% for ReHo, and 4.0% for VMHC in subcortical regions. This enhancement is achieved by increasing inter-individual variability while reducing intra-individual variability. Notably, ME-rfMRI accentuates inter-individual variability in the unimodal cortex and clearly delineates two parallel systems with distinct variability patterns within the motor cortex. Concurrently, ME-rfMRI increases effect sizes (4%-8%) for detecting individual differences between EO and EC resting states. Interestingly, ME-rfMRI reveals differential effects of eye closure on two intertwined systems in the primary motor and sensory cortices, extending previous findings. Computational simulations indicate that, compared to SE-rfMRI, ME-rfMRI facilitates experimental designs with reduced costs (i.e., 4%-11% smaller sample sizes) for precise mapping of individual differences. These findings establish, for the first time, the psychometric performance of ME-rfMRI measurements, supporting its potential utility in personalized neuroscience applications, including neurodevelopment and brain disorders.",

      "title": "A Preoptic Neurocircuit That Modulates Metabolic Flexibility",
      "content": "Precise, dynamic control of metabolic fuel usage in response to environmental challenges such as altered food availability or temperature change is essential for animal survival. In mammals, metabolic flexibility -- the capacity to shift cellular metabolism between carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation -- is understood to be largely regulated by circulating hormones such as insulin and glucagon. However, the role of the central nervous system in coordinating fuel selection and tissue metabolic tuning remains underexplored. Here, we investigated the mechanisms that mediate metabolic reprogramming following the acute activation of torpor-associated glutamatergic Adcyap1+ torpor-regulating neurons in the anteroventral preoptic area (avPOAVglut2/PACAP). The activation of these neurons rapidly shifts whole-body fuel use from glucose to fatty acids, irrespective of fuel/food availability. This shift is associated with reduced glucose utilization stemming from the transient induction of selective insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. We find that this reduction in skeletal muscle glucose metabolism does not require direct muscle innervation but is rather mediated via adrenal hormones. In contrast to their activation, avPOAVglut2/PACAP neuronal silencing results in improved glucose tolerance, demonstrating powerful bidirectional control of tissue-specific glucose metabolism, whole-body glucose levels, and fuel usage. Together, our findings uncover a novel POA-adrenal-skeletal muscle pathway that dynamically controls glucose utilization and metabolic flexibility.",

      "title": "Direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed and its implications for robot motion design",
      "content": "Humans frequently interact with robots that approach from different directions; however, how the approach direction systematically biases the perceived speed remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a robust direction-dependent bias in the perceived approach speed, whereby objects approaching from behind are consistently perceived as moving faster than those approaching from the front are. Across five experiments using both physical robots and immersive virtual reality, this bias manifests as a systematic shift in the point of subjective equality without corresponding changes in discrimination sensitivity, indicating a perceptual bias rather than altered precision. We further show that this effect can be explained by body-induced differences in interocular velocity that arise when observers orient themselves toward stimuli approaching from behind. This bias persists in virtual environments and for nonrobotic objects, suggesting that it is driven primarily by visual factors rather than multisensory cues or robot-specific appearance. Together, these findings provide a perceptual foundation for incorporating approach direction into the design and evaluation of the motion behavior of robots in human-centered environments.",

      "title": "Differential TDP-43 interactomes between the cortex and cerebellum in the mouse",
      "content": "TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the core pathogenic protein across a spectrum of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases, but its pathological deposition shows regional selectivity, with abundant TDP-43 positive aggregates in the frontal cortex and spinal cord, and a much lower burden in the cerebellum. In health, TDP-43 expression in the cerebellum is higher than in cortex, hence what underpins this differential vulnerability to TDP-43 aggregation is unclear. Here we demonstrate that in healthy C57Bl/6J mice not only is TDP-43 expression higher in the cerebellum than the cortex, but that this expression difference is driven primarily by differences in cytoplasmic load. Mass spectrometry analysis of TDP-43 pull downs from the cortex and cerebellum of healthy mice identified TDP-43 interactors across a number of core functional pathways, with numerous differences between the two brain regions. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD062532. Notably, there were more interactors identified in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions within the cortex than the cerebellum. Putative interactions with four core paraspeckle proteins; SFPQ, NONO, FUS and PSPC1 were confirmed using immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis. Follow up validation using proximity ligation assay showed abundant perinuclear cytoplasmic interactions between TDP-43 and all four paraspeckle proteins in both large motor cortex neurons and purkinje cells, with significantly reduced nuclear interactions detected in the motor cortex for SFPQ, FUS and PSPC1. These findings suggest that TDP-43-protein interactions markedly differ between the TDP-43 pathogenesis vulnerable cortex and relatively resistant cerebellum and exploring these differences may yield new insight into disease mechanisms within ALS/FTD.",
