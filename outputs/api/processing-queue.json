      "title": "Task goals dynamically reconfigure neural working memory representations",
      "content": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly shift between tasks and modify our behaviour according to current goals and context. Working memory (WM) is thought to be critical for this cognitive flexibility. A key unanswered question is how neural representations of WM are configured to support different task goals. Thirty-four participants performed a shape WM task with different task rules in interleaved blocks: delayed match-to-sample (DMS) and delayed match-to-category (DMC), while electroencephalography (EEG) was collected. Our results show that stimuli from a circular shape space can be decoded from EEG across the memory delay. Neural stimulus patterns initially generalised across tasks but reconfigured to integrate task and category information and became task-dependent in the later delay. In the DMC task, neural patterns for shapes within a category became more similar than across categories, controlling for their physical distance. This category-dependent shift was associated with greater task-dependency in the neural stimulus representation. Together, our results reveal a dynamic reconfiguration of neural WM representations over the course of the delay period to support distinct task demands.",

      "title": "Oxytocin-dependent reorganization of social vs. food motivational hierarchy and corticostriatal neural activity by social isolation in rats",
      "content": "Social interactions are crucial for the survival and well-being of mammalian individuals. The social homeostasis theory proposes that mammals actively regulate social interactions to maintain an optimal set-point, similar to feeding behavior. Yet, how the social homeostatic drive interacts with competing fundamental needs remains unclear. Moreover, the brain mechanisms underlying social homeostasis are still elusive. A potential such mechanism is oxytocin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide regulating both social and feeding behaviors. We used chronic electrophysiological recordings from behaving rats to analyze local field potential (LFP) signals simultaneously recorded from a network of brain areas associated with reward, motivation, and decision making, while the animals chose between food and social investigation. These experiments were conducted across multiple conditions of social and food deprivation to explore the interplay between the competing needs for food consumption and social interaction. We found that group-housed rats shifted preference toward food under 24-hour food deprivation, whereas socially isolated rats maintained social preference despite equivalent metabolic need. Remarkably, isolation-induced social bias persisted even after one week of re-grouping the animals, indicating long-term reorganization of motivational priorities due to social isolation. LFP recordings revealed that isolated rats exhibited elevated theta power and enhanced network coherence, compared to group-housed rats while making a choice between food to social investigation, regardless of their metabolic state. Canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that metabolic state and housing condition are encoded in orthogonal neural dimensions, suggesting that social isolation creates distinct neural signatures rather than disrupting metabolic state encoding. Systemic administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist restored balanced social-food investigation in isolated rats and selectively suppressed theta oscillations in specific corticostriatal regions during social investigation. These findings establish oxytocin-regulated theta oscillations as a neural substrate through which social experience reorganizes motivational hierarchies. Our results thus demonstrate that social needs can override metabolic drives through oxytocin-dependent modulation of corticostriatal network dynamics.",

      "title": "The Neural Code of Neuroticism",
      "content": "High neuroticism is a risk factor for mental disorders. Understanding whether individuals share a common foundation in brain function underlying neuroticism is therefore an essential goal of neuroscience. We applied Inter-Subject Representational Similarity Analysis on data from 174 Human Connectome Project participants to investigate if their similarity in neuroticism is reflected in their similarity of fMRI-recorded brain activity during movie watching. To test behavioral personality theories that consider trait expression as dependent on situational context, we examined whether brain-trait representational similarity varied between trait-relevant and trait-irrelevant movie scenes (independently rated, N = 86). Higher neuroticism was associated with greater heterogeneity in brain responses, a pattern that was particularly pronounced during trait-relevant scenes. Our study informs dimensional conceptualizations of psychopathology viewing neuroticism as risk factor and extends behavioral personality theories to the neural level. Broadly, it highlights the value of naturalistic imaging and underscores the importance of stimulus selection when investigating brain-behavior associations.",

      "title": "A microcircuit model for initiation and reward-dependent termination of hippocampal replay",
      "content": "Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) serve as a key network state in which the hippocampus replays spatiotemporal patterns that reflect animals' experiences. However, how the hippocampal circuitry controls the generation, duration, and termination of these events remains unclear. To clarify how behaviorally salient locations are encoded into replay, we constructed a biologically plausible model of area CA3, including three classes of inhibitory neurons -- parvalbumin-positive basket cells, cholecystokinin-positive basket cells (CCKBC), and theta-OFF, ripple-ON cells (TORO). In our model, replay and SWRs emerge from TORO-mediated release of CCKBC inhibition onto pyramidal cells, as hypothesized by experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that short-term depression at TORO-CCKBC synapses controls replay duration and identifies a mechanism through which replay overrepresents reward-associated locations. Our model predicts that replays terminating at these locations are shorter, which we confirm in experimental data. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic framework for SWRs and replay dynamics in the hippocampus.",

Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "title": "Pathophysiologic similarities between autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease: therapeutic possibilities",
      "content": "The comparison of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through shared pathophysiologic features offers intriguing insights into the similarities between the two disease states. The authors suggest diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage through the lymphatic system, perivascular system, and nasal turbinates may occur in ASD and AD, and be an important contributing factor in the occurrence of both disorders. Obstruction of the CSF's normal nasal lymphatic drainage results in abnormal processing of the waste proteins tau and amyloid in the brain in both of these disease states. Reproducible research has shown that ASD and AD patients, when compared to normal controls, exhibit increased extra-axial CSF, enlarged perivascular spaces, magnetic resonance imaging evidence of glymphatic dysfunction, and olfactory dysfunction. Some comparisons between the two disease states are robust while others remain speculative. However, the recognition of overlapping pathophysiologic and genetic features between the two disease states not only furthers understanding of these complex conditions, but could also pave the way for novel therapeutic avenues. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the empirically known similarities between ASD and AD and to stimulate research investigating CSF lymphatic drainage through the nasal turbinates. The authors suggest various ways to confirm their findings and provide suggestions for new therapeutic approaches for these disease states aimed at increasing the movement of CSF originating in the brain through the glymphatic system to meningeal and nasal turbinate lymphatics.",

      "title": "Neural representation of action grammar structure in primate frontal cortex",
      "content": "Humans and other animals can solve new problems, even on the first attempt. This capacity to generate novel problem-solving behavior has been hypothesized to depend on brain mechanisms for recombining units of knowledge using systems of procedural rules, or grammars. Yet, whether and how the brain represents and implements grammars remains unclear, in large part due to the lack of neural recordings (typically performed in animal models) during grammar-based problem solving (typically studied in humans). Here, we address that gap, and in turn identify an underlying neural basis of grammatical behavior. We designed a visual-motor construction task in which macaque monkeys trace complex, often novel, geometric figures by generating a sequence of strokes, each a distinct shape, like a circle, dash, or chevron (action symbols [1]). Critically, sequencing was guided by a learned hierarchical action grammar AnBmCk, meaning \"repeat shape A, then repeat shape B, then repeat shape C\", where the number of repetitions (n, m, and k) varied across problems. Behavior was internally generated (no cues guiding stroke order), problem-directed (to construct a specific image), and exhibited zero-shot generalization (successful on the first trial for novel problems, including harder ones)--key hallmarks of grammar use. To identify underlying neural substrates, we recorded from multiple frontal cortical areas previously implicated in rule use or action sequencing. Activity during drawing encoded key structural properties of the action grammar: (i) shape index (A, B, C), (ii) abstract role (e.g., the role A independent of the specific shape), and (iii) ordinal position within a shape repeat. Moreover, all three properties were strongest in a single region, the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA). We suggest that this conjunction of representations is a signature of an implementation of an iterative algorithm resembling a \"for-loop\" program: internally tracking how many repetitions remain for each shape index and switching to the next when complete. Our study establishes a paradigm for studying the neural basis of grammar-guided novel behavior and identifies in preSMA a dynamic representation of grammatical structure supporting such behavior.",
