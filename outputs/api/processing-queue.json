      "title": "The impact of human brain geometry on the transport of an intrathecal tracer",
      "content": "Background: Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), utilizing the contrast agent gadobutrol as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracer is emerging as a useful method to study glymphatic function in the human brain. A consistent finding with this technique is large inter-individual variability regarding tracer propagation. In this study, we outline an approach which predicts the distribution of tracer in the parenchyma based only on geometric information from brain tissue as captured by MRI, addressing one possible explanation for this variability. Methods: Registrations are computed from pre-injection MRI, and used to map images at 24 hours after tracer injection to perform predictions of tracer enrichment in the parenchyma in other patients. We apply the method to a dataset of human brain MRI of 134 patients examined for different tentative diagnoses including idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus, spontaneous intracranial hypotension and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, as well as a group of reference patients. Results: Tracer enrichment mapped between patients by image registration correlate strongly with actual observed enrichment. For patients in the reference group, the relative root mean squared error on our predictions is on average 26% in the gray matter, and 15% or less in other brain regions. Predictions are generally less reliable in the gray matter, and for patients with identified CSF leaks. Conclusion: We show that predictions made from purely geometrical considerations correlate strongly with actual MRI tracer enrichment for patients with similar diagnoses, thus quantifying the role of geometry in tracer enrichment.",

      "title": "Increased HCN1 activity in human excitatory neurons drives excessive network bursting in Dravet syndrome",
      "content": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe childhood epilepsy caused by mutations of the sodium channel NaV1.1. These mutations are thought to compromise the ability of inhibitory interneurons to regulate network activity, leading to seizure events. However, standard treatments to restore inhibition have limited efficacy, suggesting the existence of additional pathological mechanisms. Here, we use hiPSC-derived neuronal networks containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons to show that excessive bursting activity in DS cultures is driven by excitatory neurons. This rise in bursting frequency is caused by the increased expression of HCN1 pacemaker channels in excitatory neurons, and bursting activity can be normalised using a channel blocker. With this work, we propose a new pathophysiological mechanism in DS and identify HCN1 as a novel therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Toothy: an interactive platform for dentate spike curation",
      "content": "Dentate spikes (DSs) are hippocampal population events that occur during low-arousal states, defined by large-amplitude positive voltage peaks recorded in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG). DSs can be classified into two types (DS1 and DS2), with DS2 linked to transient increases in arousal, brain-wide neural activation, and functional relevance for memory encoding. Despite growing interest in their physiological and functional properties, no standardized framework exists for detecting and classifying DSs. We present Toothy, an open-source tool for DS detection and classification in large-scale electrophysiological recordings. Toothy offers a modular and interactive workflow comprising three key steps: (1) ingestion and preprocessing of local field potential (LFP) recordings, (2) detection of hippocampal population events, and (3) classification of DS types using peri-event current source density (CSD) profiles. To support both flexibility and reproducibility, features include compatibility with multiple recording formats, customizable processing parameters, interactive event review tools, and comprehensive logging of event detection and classification parameters. In addition to DS detection, Toothy can also detect sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs; an oscillatory population event recorded in the CA1 region), enabling comparative analysis between DSs and SPW-Rs. Toothy provides a standardized, reproducible pipeline for DS detection and classification, advancing broader efforts towards investigating hippocampal dynamics across diverse settings.",

      "content": "Skin cooling is detected by primary afferents that express the Trpm8 channel, but how this information is conveyed to the brain remains poorly understood. We have previously identified a population of lamina I projection neurons belonging to the anterolateral system (ALS) that receive numerous contacts from Trpm8-expressing primary afferents. Here, using a semi-intact somatosensory preparation, we show that these cells correspond to the cold-selective ALS neurons identified in previous physiological studies. We also confirm the presence of synapses from Trpm8 afferents onto these cells at the ultrastructural level. Based on our previous transcriptomic findings, we identify calbindin as a molecular marker, and show that this can be used to target the cold-selective ALS neurons for anterograde tracing studies. We provide evidence that they project to 3 brain regions that are associated with thermosensation: the rostralmost part of the lateral parabrachial area, the caudal part of the periaqueductal grey matter, and the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Our findings provide important insights into the organisation of neuronal circuits that underlie thermoregulation and the perception of cold stimuli applied to the skin.",

      "content": "<p>The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
      "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

      "title": "Common-specific edge-centric connectome across Four Episodes in Bipolar Disorder",
      "content": "Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heterogeneous psychiatric illness marked by dynamic mood states, including manic (BipM), depressive (BipD), mixed (mBD), and remitted (rBD) episodes. These clinical fluctuations are accompanied by widespread functional disruptions in the brain. However, the shared and individual specific neural mechanisms across distinct episodes of BD remain poorly understood. Methods: We analyzed resting state fMRI data from 190 participants (BD patients in four episodes and healthy controls) using edge centric functional connectomes (eFC), which capture time resolved cofluctuations between brain regions. A common orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) algorithm was applied to decompose individual eFC matrices into shared and individual specific subspaces. We characterized the spatial topology, genetic relevance, and circuit level correlates of the shared component. Dynamic properties (entropy, identifiability) and symptom prediction models were assessed using entropy metrics, intraclass correlation coefficients, and support vector regression. Results: The shared eFC pattern was stable across participants, aligned with the sensory association gradient, and exhibited significant heritability and test retest reliability . Entropy of individual loadings increased with illness duration and was significantly elevated in BD, particularly in mBD. Microcircuit modeling revealed that this shared pattern was inversely related to external input strength , indicating intrinsic network dominance. mBD was associated with globally elevated eFC entropy and markedly reduced fingerprint stability. Symptom severity (HDRS, YMRS, HAMA) was significantly predicted from individual network topographies across BD phases, highlighting clinically meaningful dynamic signatures. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that BD episodes are underpinned by a conserved functional scaffold and distinct individual specific neural fingerprints. Edge centric dynamics especially those derived from individual specific decompositions offer robust biomarkers for mood state characterization and symptom severity, and may facilitate future personalized interventions in BD.",

      "content": "Neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE) is a severe manifestation of lupus marked by cognitive and mood disorders, yet its hippocampal molecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a region-specific transcriptomic map of the hippocampus in MRL/Lpr mice --a validated NPSLE model-- compared to MRL+/+ controls. Bulk RNA-seq combined with integrative analyses (e.g. differential expression, GSEA, WGCNA, cell-type deconvolution) uncovered a robust disease-specific signature centered on oligodendrocyte dysfunction and myelination failure. Key myelin-related genes (Mbp, Plp1, Mog) and lineage-defining transcription factors (Sox10, Nkx6-2, Olig2) were repressed, while OPC markers remained unchanged, indicating a maturation blockade rather than lineage loss. Gene set enrichment highlighted widespread suppression of oligodendrocyte differentiation, axon ensheathment, and Wnt/retinoic acid signaling, alongside dysregulation of extracellular matrix components critical for axo-glial interactions. Co-expression network analysis revealed a disease-associated module enriched in myelination programs, with hub genes spanning structural, transcriptional, and adhesion-related functions. Deconvolution analysis confirmed a selective reduction of mature oligodendrocytes, contrasting with preserved neuronal populations and absence of classical astroglial or microglial activation signatures. RT-qPCR and Western blot validated the repression of myelination pathways at both mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these findings challenge the inflammation-centric paradigm of NPSLE, revealing a cell-intrinsic vulnerability of the oligodendrocyte lineage. This conceptual shift --from immune-driven damage to impaired glial development-- redefines NPSLE pathogenesis and suggests novel therapeutic avenues targeting oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination rather than focusing solely on immunosuppression.",

      "title": "Spinal cord structural and functional architecture and its shared organization with the brain across the adult lifespan",
      "content": "The spinal cord connects the brain to peripheral systems. Yet its integration with cerebral networks remains a key neuroscience question. Capturing structural and functional central nervous system (CNS) changes throughout the lifespan is essential for characterizing healthy and pathological aging. Leveraging a unique multimodal dataset combining spinal and cerebrospinal imaging, we jointly mapped the spinal cord structural and functional architecture across adulthood. Our results revealed age-related changes across these modalities and identified organizational principles shared with the brain. These changes were most pronounced in the somatosensory pathway, with microstructural decline coupled to shifts in functional connectivity and local spontaneous activity as aging progresses. Extending analyses to the brain uncovered convergent CNS-wide aging mechanisms, including gray matter loss, functional dedifferentiation, and increased spontaneous activity, highlighting shared neural aging trajectories. Together, our findings provide a systems-level view of alterations with age and lay the groundwork for early biomarkers of sensorimotor decline.",

      "title": "Neural activity profiles reveal overlapping, intermingled subpopulations spanning area borders in mouse sensorimotor cortex",
      "content": "Cortical control of movement is a distributed computation spanning multiple densely-interconnected regions. Although we have rich anatomical atlases and a coarse understanding of how function maps to areas and subregions, we lack a detailed account of how behaviorally-relevant activity is organized across the cortical sheet. Here, we trained head-fixed mice to perform a 15-target reach-to-grasp task while we performed cellular-resolution, two-photon calcium imaging across five regions of sensorimotor cortex (>39,000 layer 2/3 neurons). We characterized each neurons trial-averaged peri-event activity with interpretable metrics and mapped these response properties across areas, revealing large-scale spatial structure. Neuronal response profiles often shifted abruptly at anatomical borders: motor areas showed sharper tuning and more linear relationships with target location, whereas somatosensory areas displayed more heterogeneous response patterns. Neural response properties also differed according to somatotopic representation. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction of the neural feature matrix revealed that areas varied in their average response profiles, but also that each area contained subpopulations. Neurons in each subpopulation had characteristic response profiles and were distributed across multiple cortical areas. The spatial distributions of the subpopulations overlapped, with neurons from different subpopulations salt-and-pepper intermingled in the overlap zones. Together, these results describe activity structure across sensorimotor cortex and identify several distinct but spatially-overlapping subpopulations with characteristic activity patterns during reach-to-grasp behavior.",

      "content": "Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer disease (AD) are characterized by progressive accumulation of pathological Tau proteins. Among the diverse Tau species, truncated variants are emerging as key contributors, yet their identity remains elusive, particularly for the N-terminal truncated ones. The present study identifies and characterizes a novel N-terminally truncated and N-alpha-acetylated form of the Tau protein. Using a newly developed antibody specifically targeting this truncated variant, we demonstrate that this species accumulates early in degenerating neurons in both transgenic mouse models of AD-related Tau pathology and post-mortem brain tissues from AD patients. Importantly, in vivo functional experiments reveal that expression of this truncated Tau species exacerbates Tau pathology, whereas targeted immunotherapeutic with the specific antibody significantly reduces pathological Tau accumulation and prevents associated memory impairments. These findings position this newly identified Tau variant as both a marker of neurofibrillary degeneration and a pathogenic driver of neurodegeneration and supports its potential as a therapeutic target in Tau-related disorders, notably AD.",

      "title": "Slow change blindness from serial dependence",
      "content": "Slow change blindness, when attentive observers fail to notice large changes that happen gradually, raises questions about how visual information is combined across time. One plausible integration strategy is serial dependence: blending information from the recent past into current perception. Here, we investigate serial dependencies in perception of a cartoon object that slowly changes hue. In a one-shot experiment, observers each viewed a single trial with a random degree of hue change and provided one hue judgement response. Across participants, the entire morph was probed. Observers' hue reports revealed an overall bias towards the past that increased in magnitude as more of the morph was experienced. In three follow-up experiments, we verified that observers experienced slow change blindness, confirmed that the bias was serial dependence, and replicated the results with a repeated-trials design. Overall, we provide evidence that serial dependence actively biases perception during gradual changes, producing slow change blindness.",

      "title": "Circulating Lipids are Associated with PTSD Severity and Predict Symptomatic PTSD in a Cohort of Veterans and Service Members",
      "content": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by chronic stress, alterations in mood, and avoidance after a traumatic event has occurred. While recovery can occur, many PTSD patients suffer life-long impairments. In combat veterans, high rates of PTSD contribute to increased rates of depression and anxiety and a higher likelihood of suicidal ideation. The lack of biological markers for psychiatric conditions such as PTSD highlights the need for omics-based approaches to diagnosis. Discovery of novel blood-based biomarkers could aid in the development of treatments or therapies, quantify groups for those at the highest risk of adverse events, and provide insight into the molecular underpinnings of PTSD. This study used untargeted lipidomics to analyze 602 circulating lipid species in blood from a cohort of 133 veterans and combat members with varying severities of PTSD. We discovered five circulating lipids, including serum total cholesterol, cholesterol ether (ChE(18:2)), and lipids associated with metabolic dysfunction (CL(87:7), MLCL(50:4), PE(18:1e_20:3)) that correlated significantly with increasing PTSD severity after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Additionally, we showed that symptomatic PTSD patients could be separated from asymptomatic controls using these lipid species. This study contributes to the limited research surrounding the role of circulating lipids in PTSD.",
