      "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

      "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
      "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe Model Human Processor (MHP), while useful, lacks direct neurophysiological validation. This study aimed to validate and extend the MHP by analyzing P300 and Bereitschaftspotential (BP) brainwave components.MethodsOur initial finding of qualitatively different neural signatures between correct and incorrect trials led to the hypothesis that the \u201ccorrect\u201d trial group is a mixture of different processing types. We tested this by segregating correct trials based on the presence or absence of the P300 component, which we reasoned is a key marker of the MHP\u2019s conscious \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process.ResultsWe identified a P300-absent subgroup even among correct responses. This subgroup exhibited significantly shorter reaction times than its P300-present counterpart and showed a neural signature strikingly similar to that of incorrect trials, including a delayed negative peak in the BP.DiscussionThese results suggest the human information processing pathway is not monolithic. We propose a new model that bifurcates after perception into either a \u201cDeliberate Process\u201d (P300-present), which aligns with the MHP, or a high-speed \u201cAutomatic Process\u201d (P300-absent) that bypasses the MHP\u2019s \u201cInitiate Response\u201d process. This work provides neurophysiological validation for the MHP and lends new neural support for dual-process theory.",

      "title": "Hypertrophic olivary degeneration secondary to brain abscess: a case report and literature review",
      "content": "IntroductionHypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare transsynaptic neurodegenerative disorder arising from disruption of the Guillain-Mollaret triangle (GMT), a neural circuit critical for motor coordination. Classical clinical presentation includes palatal tremor. While cerebrovascular etiology dominates reported cases, HOD secondary to intracranial infections remains poorly characterized, posing diagnostic challenges.Case presentationA 72-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension presented with a 7-day history of fever, headache, and vomiting. Initial neuroimaging revealed right cerebellar hematoma with multiple brain abscesses. Antibacterial treatment achieved symptomatic improvement, but follow-up was lost. Seven months later, readmission occurred due to memory decline and personality changes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed T2-weighted hyperintensity in the left anterior medulla oblongata and hemosiderosis in the right cerebellar hemisphere. Despite the absence of clinical manifestations of HOD, prior abscess-induced GMT involvement strongly supported the diagnosis. Symptomatic management stabilized the patient, with persistent lesions but no clinical progression at 5-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case documents a rare case of HOD following bacterial brain abscess, presenting with atypical clinical features. It expands the etiological spectrum of HOD and underscores the need for heightened clinical suspicion in post-infectious neurological deterioration. Multimodal MRI facilitates early diagnosis and timely intervention, highlighting its critical role in managing this underrecognized entity.",

      "content": "ObjectiveAlthough music has been shown to affect brain function, the structural characteristics of the brain in musicians compared to non-musicians are often overlooked. This limited attention restricts the practical use of music\u2019s emotional, cognitive, and motor functions. The current study aimed to investigate structural differences in the brains of musicians compared to non-musicians in order to better understand the neuroanatomical basis of musical training.MethodsSixteen musicians and seventeen age-matched non-musicians underwent a brain structural neuroimaging scan. Group differences in structural morphometry were assessed.ResultsSignificant differences were found in cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth measures. Compared to non-musicians, musicians showed greater cortical thickness in the left superior frontal gyrus and right central parietal region, and showed structural advantages in fractal dimensionality and sulcal depth in the left fusiform gyrus and right central region. In contrast, non-musicians showed greater gyrification in the bilateral insula, right superior parietal lobule, and right supramarginal gyrus. Notably, significant interactive effects were observed between gender and cortical thickness, fractal dimensionality, gyrification, and sulcal depth in regions of the limbic system, including the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, insula, fusiform gyrus, and precuneus.ConclusionStructural differences in the frontal cortex, limbic system, and sensorimotor areas between musicians and non-musicians highlight the changes in brain structure associated with musical training. These findings provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of music-related brain function and may provide guidance for future applications of music to improve mental health and neuroplasticity.",

      "content": "BackgroundAcute stress may disrupt decision - making by affecting cognitive and emotional processing. The behavioral and neural mechanisms of this in athletes are unclear. This study explored how acute stress impacts athletes\u2019 unfairness - related decision - making and its neural basis.MethodsForty participants (20 university athletes and 20 non-athletes) were randomly assigned to a stress group or a control group. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), the study monitored the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) blood oxygenation during an ultimatum game task after inducing acute stress via the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST).ResultsAthletes under stress were more accepting of relatively unfair decisions than non-athletes. This was linked to lower activation in the frontal-eye areas (CH15), supramarginal gyrus (CH38), and somatosensory association cortex (CH67), and higher activation in the primary motor cortex (CH64) in athletes. The increase in acceptance efficiency correlated significantly with the reduced CH38 activation (r = \u22120.425) and increased CH64 activation (r = 0.499).ConclusionLong-term exercise training may promote athletes\u2019 tendency to accept relatively unfair decisions under acute stress by modulating activation levels in the supramarginal gyrus and primary motor cortex, demonstrating stronger adaptive behavior. These findings offer insights for developing stress management and neuromodulation training programs for athletes.",

      "title": "Rising burden of subarachnoid hemorrhage linked to high systolic blood pressure among young and middle-aged populations: temporal trends and global implication",
      "content": "BackgroundSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event that leads to high mortality and long-term disability, particularly among adults aged 25\u201349 years. Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the leading modifiable risk factor, yet its global burden in this age group has not been systematically assessed.MethodsWe analyzed population-level epidemiological data across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 to estimate SAH mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to high SBP. Temporal trends were evaluated using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC), and future trajectories to 2050 were projected with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.ResultsGlobally, SAH caused 24,908 deaths and 1,373,366 DALYs in 2021 due to high SBP in adults aged 25\u201349 years. Males had higher rates than females (mortality: 0.78 vs. 0.48 per 100,000; DALYs: 42.4 vs. 27.0 per 100,000), though females experienced steeper declines (EAPC_mortality: \u22121.78%). The highest burden was in the 45\u201349 age group (deaths: 9,768; DALYs: 474,092). From 1990 to 2021, high-SDI regions achieved the greatest reductions in mortality (\u221250.3%) and DALYs (\u221246.8%), while low-SDI regions saw increases in deaths (+109.5%) and DALYs (+114.7%). Nationally, Zimbabwe and Guatemala showed the sharpest increases in mortality (EAPC: +4.71% and +3.76%), while Sweden and Swiss Confederation achieved the greatest declines (EAPC: \u22125.5% and \u22124.9%). Forecasts suggest continued global declines by 2050, but widening disparities by sex, age, and socio-demographic status.ConclusionAlthough the global burden of SAH attributable to high SBP is decreasing, young and middle-aged adults-especially males and those in low-SDI regions-continue to face substantial risks. Targeted hypertension control and region-specific prevention strategies are urgently needed.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

      "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

      "content": "Prosody not only distinguishes \u201clexical\u201d meaning but also plays a key role in information packaging by highlighting the most relevant constituent of the discourse, namely, \u201cfocus\u201d information. The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",
