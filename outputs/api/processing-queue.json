      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Predicting spiking activity from scalp EEG",
      "content": "Objective. Despite decades of electroencephalography (EEG) research, the relationship between EEG and underlying spiking dynamics remains unclear. This limits our ability to infer neural dynamics reflected in intracranial signals from EEG, a critical step to bridge electrophysiological findings across species and to develop non-invasive brain\u2013machine interfaces (BMIs). In this study, we aimed to estimate spiking activity in the visual cortex using non-invasive scalp EEG. Approach. We recorded spiking activity from a 32-channel floating microarray permanently implanted in parafoveal V1 and scalp-EEG in a male macaque monkey. While the animal fixated, the screen flickered at different temporal frequencies to induce steady-state visual evoked potentials. We analyzed the relationship between the V1 multi-unit spiking activity envelope (MUAe) and EEG frequency bands to predict MUAe at each time point from EEG. We extracted instantaneous spectrotemporal features of the EEG signal, including phase, amplitude, and phase-amplitude coupling of its frequency bands. Main results. Although the relationship between these spectrotemporal features and the V1 MUAe was complex and frequency-dependent, they were reliably predictive of the MUAe. Specifically, in a linear regression predicting MUAe from EEG, each EEG feature (phase, amplitude, coupling) contributed to model predictions. In addition, we found that MUAe predictions were better in shallow than deep cortical layers, and that the phase of stimulus frequency further improved MUAe predictions. Significance. Our study shows that a comprehensive account of spectrotemporal features of non-invasive EEG provides information on underlying spiking activity beyond what is available when only the amplitude or phase of the EEG signal is considered. This demonstrates the richness of the EEG signal and its complex relationship with neural spiking activity and suggests that using more comprehensive spectrotemporal signatures could improve BMI applications.",

      "title": "Adaptive neuromodulation dialogues: navigating current challenges and emerging innovations in neuromodulation system development",
      "content": "Adaptive neuromodulation systems and implantable brain-computer interfaces have made notable strides in recent years, translating experimental prototypes into clinical applications and garnering substantial attention from the public. This surge in interest is accompanied by increased scrutiny related to the safety, efficacy, and ethical implications of these systems, all of which must be directly addressed as we introduce new neurotechnologies. In response, we have synthesized the insights resulting from discussions between groups of experts in the field and summarized them into five key domains essential to therapeutic device development: (1) analyzing current landscape of neuromodulation devices and translational platforms (2) identifying clinical need, (3) understanding neural mechanisms, (4) designing viable technologies, and (5) addressing ethical concerns. The role of translational research platforms that allow rapid, iterative testing of hypotheses in both preclinical and clinical settings is emphasized. These platforms must balance experimental flexibility with patient safety and clear clinical benefit. Furthermore, requirements for interoperability, modularity, and wireless communication protocols are explored to support long-term usability and scalability. The current regulatory processes and funding models are examined alongside the ethical responsibilities of researchers and device manufacturers. Special attention is given to the role of patients as active contributors to research and to the long-term obligations we have to them as the primary burden-bearers of the implanted neurotechnologies. This article represents a synthesis of scientific, engineering, and clinical viewpoints to inform key stakeholders in the neuromodulation and brain-computer interface spaces.",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

      "title": "Numerical Variability of functional MRI Graph Measures",
      "content": "Network neuroscience provides a powerful framework for studying the mechanisms underlying brain-related diseases. As analyses become increasingly computational, ensuring their numerical reliability has become a critical challenge. Small perturbations introduced during processing can propagate through complex pipelines, leading to variability in outcomes and raising concerns about the reproducibility of reported findings. Addressing this issue requires systematic evaluation of pipeline stability to ensure results remain within acceptable numerical limits. While the numerical variability of structural imaging workflows has been investigated, with findings ranging from stable to highly variable, functional MRI (fMRI) pipelines and their derived graph measures remain underexplored. Without rigorous stability assessment, conclusions drawn from these measures may remain uncertain. We systematically evaluated the numerical variability of graph measures of functional connectivity derived from the widely-used fMRIPrep pipeline and compared it to population variability. The resulting Numerical-Population Variability Ratio (NPVR) values ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 for most graph metrics, indicating a measurable influence of numerical variability on network-derived outcomes. NPVR values varied across brain regions, thresholding choices, and confound regression strategies. These findings highlight numerical variability as an important factor in functional network studies, particularly when examining subtle effects or working with small sample sizes.",

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "A high-content imaging workflow to screen for molecules that reduce cellular uptake of \u03b1-synuclein preformed fibrils",
      "content": "A classical pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases is the formation of protein-rich aggregates and inclusions. In Parkinson's disease (PD), -synuclein (-syn) constitutes a major protein component of pathological inclusions, termed Lewy bodies. These -syn aggregates are hypothesized to spread throughout the nervous system by cell-to-cell transmission acting as templates to amplify aggregate formation. In vitro generated -syn aggregates, commonly called preformed fibrils (PFFs), have been used to investigate a number of aspects related to -syn mediated pathology across different model systems. Here we describe a semi-automated assay to screen for small molecules that interfere with the cellular uptake and accumulation of PFFs. The assay uses dopaminergic progenitor cells (DPCs), derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In an initial screen, we tested 1520 small molecules and identified several molecules that strongly reduce intracellular PFF load in DPCs. From these hits, candidate compounds were validated in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) to demonstrate the utility of the assay. This assay provides a robust, scalable and adaptable tool to screen for molecules that affect PFF uptake in hiPSC-derived cell models. Within the scope of this screen, it led to the identification of a set of compounds with diverse annotated targets that effectively reduce the uptake of synuclein aggregates in DPCs and DNs.",

      "title": "10.5 Tesla High-Resolution Macaque Brain MRI for Connectivity Studies",
      "content": "Mapping brain connectivity in primates remains a major challenge due to difficulties in resolving microscopic white matter architecture, while maintaining whole-brain coverage. Increasing imaging spatial resolution is key for disambiguating fiber configurations within smaller anatomical volumes. Here, we present developments that allow high-resolution diffusion MRI of the macaque brain, both in vivo and ex vivo, using one of the world's highest-field human MRI scanners operating at 10.5 Tesla. Our approach achieves data of highest reported resolutions for this field strength and scanner type, (750 m)3 in vivo and (400 m)3 ex vivo, with diffusion weighting up to b = 6000 s/mm2. We detail methodological advances in data acquisition, image reconstruction, processing and whole-brain tractography that overcome critical challenges associated with ultra-high-field imaging. This work establishes a new benchmark for high-resolution neuroimaging at 10.5T, paving the way for comparable human studies and enabling analyses of brain connectivity across species and tissue states at unprecedented detail. The dataset, along with all processing pipelines, containerised workflows, and reusable web services, is openly shared to support reproducibility and future integration with microscopy for studying white matter microstructure and connections at the mesoscale.",
