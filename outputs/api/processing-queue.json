      "content": "IntroductionThe accumulation of genomic and brain data opens new opportunities for resource friendly, data driven brain exploration. A key challenge is to develop versatile and accessible strategies that integrate and mine multimodal datasets for novel neuroscientific insights. Here, we optimized an integrated workflow for mapping multigenic evolutionary traits in the human brain across cognitive, cellular, and molecular levels.MethodsAt the input stage, the workflow fuses an evolutionary genetic dataset with searchable synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) databases that are pre clustered into concise psychological domains for improved interpretability. At its core, a Genetic Algorithm for Generalized Biclustering (GABi) mines gene sets under evolutionary selection that also show high expression correlation with fMRI networks.ResultsApplying this workflow, we identified evolutionary patterns spanning cognitive traits, brain cell types, and molecular mechanisms. Focusing on socio affective traits, the algorithm highlighted peaks in adaptive selection in networks for social interaction (language) and social concepts (theory of mind) across hominid, early hominin, and anatomically modern human (AMH) ancestry. These traits emerge from a broad spectrum of excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neuronal, as well as non neuronal, cell types. The associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched for cell signaling, synaptic organization, and neuronal morphology.DiscussionTogether, these findings demonstrate an integrated workflow for molecular to systems level exploration of the brain and provide new perspectives on the evolutionary history of human socio affective functions. This approach can be adapted to screen for functional traits in the context of mental disorders or applied to the brains of other phylogenies in a similar manner.",

      "title": "Functional mapping of the somatotopic organization of the supplementary motor area using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and computer vision-based analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundThe supplementary motor area (SMA) is a cortical region involved in motor and language functions. Motor representations within the SMA follow a somatotopic organization: Anterior regions are linked to orofacial movements, middle regions to upper limb movements, and posterior regions to lower limb movements. SMA lesions may produce impairments that correspond to this somatotopy; therefore, preoperative assessment may aid diagnosis.ObjectiveThis study aimed to revise and extend a protocol for assessing the SMA using navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS), incorporating somatotopic organization and validating positive stimulation points against non-motor regions.MethodsThe dominant-hemisphere SMA of 30 healthy participants (27.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.21\u202fyears, 18 female) was examined. After mapping of the primary motor cortex with single-pulse TMS, six predefined SMA sites were stimulated using 20\u202fHz nrTMS while participants performed the Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT; 120% resting motor threshold (RMT)), the lower extremity motor coordination test (LEMOCOT; 140% RMT), and an orofacial task (130% RMT). Each test was repeated under identical parameters at non-motor control sites. Kinematic measurements were obtained using high-speed recordings.ResultsSMA stimulation disrupted upper extremity function, with the strongest effects observed at posterior sites. In contrast, lower extremity performance was not impaired during SMA stimulation, where tapping speed increased under validation conditions. Orofacial effects were limited and inconsistent, occurring mainly during stimulation outside the SMA and showing no significant spatial pattern.ConclusionThe expected somatotopic organization of the SMA could not be demonstrated using nrTMS. However, SMA-selective disruptions of upper extremity movements suggest a functional, rather than effector-specific, organization. The novel kinematic paradigm enabled detailed, objective analysis of movement phases and may benefit future TMS studies.",

      "title": "Patients with chronic ankle instability exhibit increased sensorimotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus activation during single-leg stance: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study",
      "content": "IntroductionBalance deficits are associated with clinical manifestations in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI); however, evidence of cortical plasticity related to balance control remains insufficient. This study aimed to evaluate cortical activity and balance differences between patients with CAI and healthy individuals during single-leg stance, with or without vision, and to explore the correlations between brain blood flow signals and homeostatic function to elucidate the neurophysiological changes in balance control.MethodsThis cohort study involved 30 patients with CAI from a single hospital and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Cortical activity in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The activity ranges of the center of mass (COM), acceleration, and acceleration extremes were calculated using wearable inertial sensors. Moreover, scale assessments (visual analog scale, foot and ankle ability measure, and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool) and functional tests (classical balance, Y-balance, multi-directional reach tests, and timed up-and-go tests) were conducted.ResultsSignificant between-group effects were observed for the root mean square (RMS) centroid acceleration in the anteroposterior (AP) direction (F = 5.51, p = 0.02), whereas within- and between-group differences existed for RMS centroid acceleration in the mediolateral (ML) direction (F = 3.56, p = 0.03; F = 8.5, p = 0.004). Significant within- and between-group differences were identified for peak acceleration magnitude (Acc_max) \u2013AP (F = 7.85, p = 0.001; F = 11.83, p = 0.001) and Acc_max\u2013ML (F = 15.64, p = 0.0001; F = 5.06, p = 0.026). The oxyhemoglobin concentration change (\u0394HbO2) was significantly greater in patients with CAI than in healthy controls during single-leg stance; between-group differences were identified in the STG\u2013right cerebral hemisphere (R) (F = 10.25, p = 0.002), DLPFC\u2013R (F = 50.99, p = 0.001), SMC\u2013R (F = 27.48, p = 0.0001), STG\u2013left cerebral hemisphere (L) (F = 13.6, p = 0.0001), DLPFC\u2013L (F = 24.21, p = 0.0001), and SMC\u2013L (F = 29.75, p = 0.0001); within-group differences in the SMC\u2013L (F = 9.92, p = 0.0001); and interaction effects in the STG\u2013R (F = 5.73, p = 0.004). During right-leg stance with the eyes closed, RMS\u2013ML and Acc_max\u2013ML exhibited a high positive correlation with \u0394HbO2 in the STG\u2013L (RMS\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.72; Acc_max\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.74).ConclusionPatients with CAI exhibited lower balance ability and greater COM bias than healthy controls, with increased bilateral activation in brain regions, regardless of which limb was elevated; the results were more pronounced with vision inhibited. Enhanced brain activity was positively correlated with COM changes. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy and wearable inertial sensors can detect balance in patients with CAI.",
