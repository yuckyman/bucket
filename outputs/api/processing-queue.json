      "title": "Ectopic expression of two cone opsins in mouse RGCs results in opposite responses to light stimulation, likely due to differential G protein activation",
      "content": "Retinitis pigmentosa, a leading cause of inherited blindness, results in photoreceptor degeneration that current optogenetic approaches aim to address through microbial opsin expression in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). While these microbial proteins restore light sensitivity, their clinical potential remains limited by low light sensitivity and immunogenicity risks. Recent efforts have focused on vertebrate opsins as safer alternatives, with mid-wavelength cone opsin (MW-opsin) demonstrating RGC depolarization via endogenous G-protein signaling. In this study, we reveal a surprising divergence in signaling outcomes of expressing short-wavelength mouse cone opsin (Opn1sw) in RGCs of blind mice. Using multielectrode array recordings and whole-cell patch clamping, we demonstrate that Opn1sw induces membrane hyperpolarization in RGCs - a stark contrast to MW-opsin's depolarizing effects. This unexpected inversion suggests differential engagement of intracellular signaling pathways, potentially stemming from distinct G-protein coupling preferences. Comparative analysis of native G-protein expression profiles in RGCs versus cone photoreceptors supports this hypothesis, revealing mismatches that may explain ectopic opsin behavior. Our findings challenge the assumption of conserved opsin signaling across spectral subtypes and cell types, highlighting critical gaps in understanding vertebrate opsin-G protein interactions in non-native cellular environments. This discovery points to the necessity of systematic characterization of opsin signaling networks in target retinal cells, a prerequisite for engineering optimized optogenetic tools that reliably produce desired electrophysiological outcomes. By establishing spectral subtype-dependent signaling divergence, our work redefines parameters for developing next-generation vision restoration therapies.",

      "title": "Is there a link between motor learning and mirror neuron system: TMS study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Plasma Levels of Endocannabinoids and Related Lipids Before and After acute and repeated mTBI: an exploratory study for plasma biomarkers for mTBI",
      "content": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common diagnosis across all age groups and while most symptoms resolve within a few weeks; between 10 and 25 percent of mTBI patients suffer long-term problems. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), symptoms include headache, a range of cognitive deficits, and depression. Currently, there are no established treatments for PCS and no clear predictive biometrics to determine which patients are at increased risk. Previous studies have identified some protein-derived plasma biomarkers for mTBI, however, the effects of mTBI on lipid signaling molecules and metabolites in blood is largely unknown. Endogenous lipids (endolipids) such as the endocannabinoids (eCBs) and their congeners are lipid signaling molecules that are associated with promoting neuroprotective responses after head trauma in animal models. Here, we examine the plasma lipidome using a rat model of acute and repeated mTBI that we previously demonstrated had a sex dependent change in neuroinflammation wherein females showed a higher degree of neurodegeneration after repeated head-injury than males. Key results of this exploratory lipidomics screen here demonstrates that acute head injury drives significantly more changes in plasma endolipids in males (32%) than females (8%), whereas, on the second day of head injury, only 11% change in males but 15% in females. Some key endolipids were modified in both males are precursors for resolving molecules and this was lacking in females. Given that females with repeated mTBI in this model demonstrated aspects of PCS, this could be an important component in evaluating clinical cases. Endolipids in the screen were measurable in plasma using only 100 microL, a volume necessary to be able to perform multiple blood draws on these rodent subjects. This threshold provides evidence that the levels of these endolipids could be readily measured throughout patient recovery. Therefore, this family of endolipids has the potential to provide data on the progression of the injury and could be another crucial aspect in predicting mTBI outcomes.",

      "title": "From ambiguous object to illusory faces: EEG decoding reveals a dynamic cascade of face pareidolia",
      "content": "Face pareidolia, perceiving faces in inanimate objects, provides a unique window into how the brain constructs perceptual meaning from ambiguous visual input. In this work, we investigated the neural dynamics of face pareidolia, testing the hypothesis that it emerges from a temporal cascade that integrates global (low spatial frequency, LSF) and local (high spatial frequency, HSF) visual information. With a pareidolia detection task, we combined event-related potentials (ERP), multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), and representational similarity analysis (RSA) to map the evolving neural code for illusory face perception. Behaviorally, participants experienced pareidolia from both LSF and HSF stimuli, but the percept was strongest for broadband images containing both frequency bands. Electrophysiological results revealed a clear temporal progression. Early processing (<150 ms) was driven by low-level attributes, with distinct P100/N100 components and neural representations for LSF and HSF signals. A critical shift occurred around 145 ms, after which MVPA decoding could reliably distinguish between images perceived as faces and those that were not. Concurrently, RSA showed that the geometry of neural representations shifted to reflect participants' subjective face-likeness ratings, rather than the initial physical properties of the stimuli. This transition to a higher-order, subjective evaluation was marked by a later N250 component, whose amplitude indexed the cognitive load of integrating the visual cues. Together, these findings demonstrate that face pareidolia is a dynamic neural cascade, from early sensory encoding to higher-order perceptual evaluation, driven by the integration of global configuration and local features of visual stimuli. Our results illuminate how the brain transforms ambiguous input into meaningful social perception, offering insight into the temporal dynamics of visual awareness.",

      "title": "Neurophysiological Sensitivity to Envelope and Pulse Timing Interaural Time Differences in Cochlear Implanted Rats with Different Hearing Experiences",
      "content": "Cochlear implants (CIs) have successfully restored hearing in more than one million patients with severe to profound hearing loss worldwide. While CIs effectively restore speech perception in quiet environments, sound localization remains challenging for bilateral CI users, particularly their ability to utilize interaural time differences (ITDs). The majority of clinical CI processors use a coding strategy that encodes ITD information only in the envelope of electrical pulse trains rather than their pulse timing, which may contribute to the poorer spatial hearing perception of CI users. We recently demonstrated in a behavioral study on early deafened, bilaterally CI-implanted rats that pulse timing ITDs completely dominate ITD perception, while sensitivity to envelope ITDs is almost negligible in comparison. Building on this, we here investigated the neurophysiological sensitivity of the inferior colliculus (IC) to envelope and pulse timing ITDs at two different pulse rates (900 and 4500 pulses/s) and three different stimulation modulations (5, 20 and 100 Hz) in CI rats with different hearing experiences. Our results indicate that IC neurons exhibit far greater sensitivity to pulse timing ITD than envelope ITD independent of pulse rate, modulation rate or hearing experience. These findings suggest that to improve binaural hearing outcome in bilateral CI users, clinical stimulation strategies should provide informative pulse timing ITDs.",

It was found that after SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with NAC and exposed to H-LIPEF stimulation, the oxidative stress of cells was reduced in the subsequent treatment with H2O2. The results showed that the combined NAC and H-LIPEF treatment significantly improved cell viability and better preserved cellular morphology compared to either treatment alone. Additionally, this combination treatment more effectively reduced mitochondrial apoptosis. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the combination substantially decreased levels of superoxide and intracellular H2O2, which was associated with enhanced activation of the p-Akt/Nrf2/SOD2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the treatment reduced the accumulation of 8-oxo-dG accumulation and elevated MTH1 expression, indicating a protective effect against oxidative DNA damage. These results suggest that H-LIPEF enhances the neuroprotective efficacy of low-dose NAC, highlighting the potential of this combination approach as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NDDs.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",
