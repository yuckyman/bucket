      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "Dynamic methylation changes in Alzheimers disease-related genes during mindfulness practice - a proof-of-concept study",
      "content": "Background: Mindfulness meditation has gained significant attention in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its potential effects on the prevention of cognitive decline and overall psychological well-being. The epigenetic landscape of this complex neurodegenerative disorder can be influenced by environmental factors. Mindfulness practices could actively shape the biological response to AD by modifying the underlying molecular mechanisms through epigenetic regulation. Methods: A group of 17 long-term mindfulness meditators (MMs) and 17 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Experienced MMs participated in a 1-month Vipassana meditation retreat. Blood DNA methylation levels of differentially methylated genes (ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3, NXN, TREM2 and TREML2) previously validated in a predictive AD-model found analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results: An increase in DNA methylation was observed for ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3 and TREM2 in MMs with respect to controls. Furthermore, significant differences were found for ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE and HOXA3 in MMs after retreat. Conclusions: DNA methylation changes identified for ADAM10 and HOXA3 in MMs are in the opposite direction to those occurring in AD and may constitute a protective epigenetic alteration. Mindfulness practice could counteract DNA methylation of key AD genes as a possible preventive strategy or non-pharmacological intervention in AD patients.",

      "title": "Comparative Analysis of FOXP2 Expression in the Thalamus of Mice, Rats, and Macaques: Implications for the Evolution of Language Circuits.",
      "content": "FOXP2 is a transcription factor essential for the development and function of neural circuits involved in language. Although its expression has been extensively characterized in the cortex and basal ganglia, its organization within the adult thalamus remains poorly understood. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of FoxP2 protein expression across thalamic nuclei in mice, rats, and macaques, with a focus on nuclei associated with higher-order cognitive functions and language-related circuits in humans. We found that FoxP2 is expressed in most thalamic nuclei across species, with a consistent absence in the reticular nucleus and zona incerta. Expression was highest in midline and intralaminar nuclei, whereas the anterior group showed low and variable expression among species. Macaques exhibited broader and, in some nuclei, more intense FoxP2 expression, particularly in associative regions such as the pulvinar, lateral geniculate, and parts of the ventral group, indicating increased specialization of thalamocortical pathways. This distribution suggests a conserved role for FoxP2 in shaping thalamic circuits supporting sensorimotor integration, attention, memory, and linguistic processing. Phylogenetic comparisons further indicate that enhanced FoxP2 expression in associative thalamic territories in primates, likely intensified in humans, may have contributed to the evolution of neural circuits required for speech and language. These findings provide molecular and anatomical insights into how FoxP2 helps organize thalamocortical networks relevant both to language function and to neuropsychiatric disorders involving thalamocortical dysconnectivity.",

      "title": "WWOX deficiency uncovers a cell-autonomous mechanism impairing myelin repair",
      "content": "Remyelination is essential for neuronal function and plasticity, and its failure contributes to multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, the molecular programs governing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) as a critical cell-autonomous regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair. Reanalysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing from MS lesions revealed WWOX as one of the most significantly dysregulated oligodendroglial genes. Conditional deletion of Wwox in oligodendroglia impaired OPC differentiation, favouring aberrant proliferation and blocking myelin regeneration after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Single-nucleus transcriptomics confirmed profound transcriptional reprogramming in WWOX-deficient oligodendroglia during remyelination, with enrichment of WNT and TGFb; signalling and cell cycle programs. Mechanistically, WWOX physically interacts with the master transcription factor SOX10 via its WW1 domain, stabilising SOX10 protein and sustaining its downstream myelin gene network. Loss of WWOX reduced SOX10 stability and activity, providing a direct mechanistic link to defective OPC differentiation. Together, our findings uncover WWOX as an essential orchestrator of remyelination and position the WWOX-SOX10 axis as a promising therapeutic target for enhancing myelin repair in MS and related demyelinating disorders.",
