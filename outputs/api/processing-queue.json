      "title": "Building neuroanatomical resources for three-spined sticklebacks: Brain areas important for social behavior",
      "content": "Introduction: Three-spined stickleback fish are famous for their diversity and charismatic social behavior. However, there are few neuroanatomical resources for studying the neural and brain mechanisms underlying their fascinating behavior. Methods and Results: We identify 11 brain areas important for social behavior by referencing brain atlases for six other teleost fishes. Brain regions were identified via neuroanatomical landmarks and we characterized the presence / absence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key gene product of the dopaminergic system, in those regions. Comparing the neuroanatomical location of these regions in the stickleback brain and the expression of TH therein to that of other fish species highlights similarities and differences and the need for a brain atlas specific to sticklebacks. This resource serves as a map of the location of regions important for social behavior in the stickleback brain. Conclusion: This resource will help guide future studies connecting gene function to social behavior through the brain and will enable future work to understand the evolution of neural mechanisms that contribute to the diversity of social behavior in this emerging model organism.",

      "title": "Associations between habitual light exposure-related behaviors and sleep timing and sleep complaints in an international community sample",
      "content": "Sleep is essential for health and light is an important environmental signal influencing its timing, quality, and regulation. Retinal light exposure reflects the interplay between environmental illumination and behavioral choices, yet it remains unclear which habitual light exposure-related behaviors meaningfully impact sleep outcomes. In this preregistered analysis, we examined associations between these behaviors, sleep timing, and sleep complaints in a large, international community sample (N = 774, mean age = 32.6 {+/-} 14.6 years). Participants completed the Light Exposure Behavior Assessment (LEBA), with four behavioral domains included in the analyses. Sleep timing, sleep disturbances and sleep-related daytime impairment were measured using established questionnaires. Bayesian analyses indicated that time spent outdoors and device use in bed were most strongly associated with sleep outcomes. Greater time outdoors was linked to earlier sleep timing and fewer sleep complaints, whereas more frequent device use in bed was associated with greater sleep disturbance and daytime impairment. Morning and daytime lighting practices and evening light control showed no conclusive evidence. Together, these findings highlight the relevance of everyday light exposure-related behaviors for sleep and support behavioral approaches to promoting healthy sleep in real-world contexts.",

      "title": "A prelimbic molecular clock of protein synthesis for memory persistence",
      "content": "Emotionally salient associative memories can endure for long periods, yet the mechanisms that determine their long-term stability remain unclear. Here we show that the prelimbic (PL) cortex integrates temporally structured translational programs to control both the consolidation and reconsolidation of cued threat memories. Using Pavlovian threat conditioning with in vivo fiber photometry, we found that PL calcium dynamics tightly track memory strength: discrete threat-predictive cues evoked robust activity during recent and single-timepoint remote retrieval, whereas prior retrieval selectively weakened remote expression, independent of contextual influences. Translational profiling of PL Camk2a cells uncovered a biphasic consolidation program, with an early phase characterized by ER stress-linked translational repression and robust oligodendrocyte plasticity, followed by a delayed phase engaging synaptic growth pathways. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches demonstrated that eIF2-regulated, cap-independent translation is essential for recent consolidation and for the enduring stabilization of remote memory, whereas retrieval-induced destabilization engages a mechanistically distinct, eIF4E-dependent translational pathway required for reconsolidation. These findings identify the PL cortex as a dynamic node in which discrete modes of translational control govern the long-term persistence of emotional memories.",
