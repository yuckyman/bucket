      "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
      "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

      "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
      "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
      "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "Early menopause is associated with reduced global brain activity",
      "content": "Menopause affects the aging process in women through significant ovarian hormone production decline in midlife. Women who experience early menopause face an accelerated physiological aging rate, along with impaired memory and increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains elusive how the timing of menopause affects brain activity, which could be crucial for understanding menopause-related acceleration of aging and increased risk of dementia. Recent studies have revealed a highly structured infra-slow (< 0.1 Hz) global brain activity across species and linked it to arousal and memory functions, as well as waste clearance in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). In this study, we examined how this global brain activity relates to age of menopause using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project-Aging dataset. We found that women who experienced earlier menopause (mean menopausal age 45{+/-}3.5 yr) exhibited weaker global brain activity (p = 5.0x10-4) with reduced coupling to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow (p = 0.017) compared to age-matched later-menopausal women (mean menopausal age 54{+/-}1.2 yr). Differences appeared mainly in higher-order brain regions, where activation levels correlated with memory performance in earlier but not in intermediate or later menopausal women. These findings highlight brain activity changes linked to early menopause, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying memory decline and the increased risk of AD and dementias in early-onset menopausal women.",

      "content": "The circadian system regulates core physiological processes, including muscle regeneration, protein synthesis, and cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in circadian rhythms contribute to impaired muscle function in older adults, with age-related declines in muscle mass and regenerative capacity serving as major contributors to sarcopenia. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise\u2014a powerful modulator of muscle adaptation\u2014can also influence circadian regulation, offering a potential avenue to enhance muscle repair in aging populations. This review examines how physical activity interacts with circadian mechanisms in aged skeletal muscle, emphasizing key molecular and cellular pathways involved in muscle regeneration. Central circadian regulators such as Clock, BMAL1, and PER1 are discussed in the context of muscle protein turnover, satellite cell activity, and mitochondrial function. Aligning exercise timing with circadian rhythms is proposed as a promising strategy to enhance muscle recovery and functional capacity in older individuals. Furthermore, the review highlights the therapeutic potential of chrono-exercise to delay the onset of sarcopenia and promote healthy aging. By integrating insights from chronobiology, geroscience, and exercise physiology, this analysis underscores the importance of chrono-exercise in supporting muscle health during aging.",

Genetic analysis revealed 6 missense mutations, 1 code-shift mutation, and 1 large segment deletion, including 1 de novo and 7 hereditary mutations. Four children exhibited global developmental delay. Seizure types included generalized tonic\u2013clonic (5 cases), tonic (1 case), and 2 forms of seizures: tonic seizures and atonic seizures (2 cases). EEG showed abnormal discharges in all cases: focal (4 cases), multifocal (3 cases), and slow-wave (1 case). Brain MRI abnormalities were observed in 4 children, including delayed myelination, hyaloid septal cavities, and microgyrus malformation. Diagnoses included Lennox\u2013Gastaut syndrome (4 cases) and self-limiting epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (2 cases). Six children responded well to medication (seizure reduction >25%), while 2 had poor control.ConclusionDEPDC5 gene mutations result in diverse phenotypes, potentially influenced by age of onset and mutation type. Generalized seizures were most common, with high rates of EEG abnormalities and structural brain changes. In a few cases (3 cases), treatment with levetiracetam and phenobarbital can reduce the frequency of epileptic seizures by 25%, but due to limited sample size, its exact efficacy still needs further research and verification.",

      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

      "title": "The articulatory basis of phonological error patterns in childhood speech sound disorders",
      "content": "Speech acquisition involves complex coordination of articulatory structures, primarily the jaw, lips, and tongue. Typically developing children acquire speech sounds in a hierarchical sequence governed by progressive neuromotor maturation. However, disruptions in speech motor control can lead to systematic phonological error patterns, commonly attributed to cognitive-linguistic deficits. This study explores the articulatory foundations of phonological error patterns in preschool-aged children diagnosed with moderate-to-severe speech sound disorders. Using data from 48 children who participated in a randomized controlled trial, we employed Mutual Information Analysis and Random Forest Models to quantify associations between specific speech motor limitations and phonological error patterns identified via the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology assessment. Results showed moderate associations between phonological error patterns in particular cluster reduction, final consonant deletion, stopping, gliding, and atypical errors and limitations in jaw, labial-facial, and lingual control. Gliding, unexpectedly, demonstrated a negative relationship with speech motor errors, being more prevalent among older and milder cases, suggesting it may reflect a compensatory developmental stage rather than purely phonological simplification. These findings highlight the significance of speech motor constraints in phonological error patterns, challenging traditional cognitive-linguistic explanations. The results support theoretical frameworks such as Articulatory Phonology, emphasizing that phonological error patterns are influenced substantially by articulatory and neuromotor development. This study underscores the need for integrating motor considerations into clinical assessments and interventions for speech sound disorders in children, fostering a comprehensive approach bridging cognitive-linguistic and motor speech perspectives.",

      "title": "Efficacy of snap-needle patch therapy in pediatric epilepsy: a case study",
      "content": "BackgroundsEpilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder in early childhood, often characterized by genetic predisposition and diverse clinical manifestations. Benign epilepsy of childhood with central temporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common form of self-limited focal epilepsy (SeLFE) syndrome in children, accounting for approximately 6%\u20137% of all childhood epilepsy cases (Wirrell et al., 2011; Camfield et al., 1996). We report a case of a child who was treated with additional snap-needle for 3 months on top of poorly controlled oral medication alone, who stopped having seizures and gradually reduced the dose of oral medication and finally stopped, and was followed up for 1 year after stopping the medication without any recurrence.Case summaryA 10-years-old male had his first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) at age 7 during nocturnal sleep. Following this event, the parents sought medical evaluation, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal wave patterns. Over the following 3 years, the child had 2\u20133 GTCS annually; despite multiple adjustments to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, GTCS frequency indicated disease progression. However, after starting snap-needle patch therapy [guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles], the child remained seizure-free. Continuous monitoring has been conducted to date. We present this case of a pediatric patient with epilepsy: oral medication failed to control GTCS, but snap-needle patch therapy achieved successful seizure management, after which oral medication was discontinued.ConclusionAfter a systematic literature search, this study represents the first case report of BECTS treated with snap-needle therapy (needle size: 0.220 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm). In this case, the child\u2019s GTCSs resolved following the addition of snap-needle therapy, and oral antiepileptic medication was gradually reduced to complete discontinuation; no seizure recurrence was observed within 1 year of follow-up. It is important to acknowledge that the contributions of medication adjustments and the self-limiting nature of BECTS cannot be ruled out in this case. However, based on the observations here, we propose the hypothesis that snap-needle intervention is likely associated with seizure remission. Although the mechanism underlying snap-needle therapy for BECTS remains unclear, the child achieved a QOLCE-16-C score of 98.4 at the end of treatment; during the 1-year follow-up, the number of nighttime sleep disruptions also decreased from 2 to 5 episodes per year to 0. These outcomes surpass those typically achievable through pharmacological intervention alone.",
