      "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
      "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

      "title": "Tau-induced ribosomal collisions impair memory through the activation of the integrated stress response",
      "content": "The formation of new long-term memories is reliant upon the spatial and temporal regulation of mRNA translation. Translational control has been demonstrated to be disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases, which exhibit impairments in both homeostatic translation and memory formation, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, the precise mechanisms by which this dysregulation occurs, as well as the pathogenic consequences of this dysregulation have yet to be described. Here we establish that FTD-associated tau mutations impair protein synthesis prior to the onset of memory impairments by slowing ribosomal elongation speed, causing ribosomes to collide upon mRNAs. We reveal that this tau-induced ribosomal collision ultimately impairs memory-associated translation through activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) via GCN2. Pharmacological prevention of this ISR activation not only rescues memory formation in the PS19 mouse model of FTD, but also attenuates neuronal death, decreases tau phosphorylation and accumulation, and improves survival. Collectively, our data elucidates a novel mechanism by which mRNA translation is impaired early in neurodegeneration, identifies several pathological phenotypes which are traceable to impairments in mRNA translation, and highlights the therapeutic potential of rescuing these translational impairments.",

      "content": "Approximately 45% of new HIV infections worldwide occur in women and girls and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection is limited. Long-acting PrEP such as lenacapavir may improve adherence. One barrier to PrEP usage in women and girls is impact on the menstrual cycle, though impacts of long-acting PrEP are unclear. To model the effect of lenacapavir administration on cyclicity, adult female C57Bl/6J mice were injected with CA inhibitor 1 and assessed for estrous cyclicity. Ca inhibitor 1 transiently delayed the start of the next cycle. However, Ca inhibitor 1 was associated with a higher proportion of normal length estrous cycles. Ca inhibitor 1 did not impact astrocyte immunoreactivity or chronic cellular activity in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a major regulator of the estrous cycle. These findings suggest that lenacapavir may be a viable PrEP alternative for those concerned with PrEP impacts on menstrual cycle.",

      "title": "Stimulated human cortical waves: spatiotemporal dynamics across development",
      "content": "Traveling waves of neural activity are fundamental to cortical function, yet their spatiotemporal dynamics and structural constraints remain less understood in human brain. Conventional analyses focus on network topology and spatial geometry of neural signals, with limited emphasis on wave dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions. Here, we applied a manifold-based optical flow algorithm to an open-access intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) dataset from the single-pulse stimulation cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) paradigm, enabling direct construction of high-temporal-resolution cortical neural activity velocity fields. Spatiotemporal mode decomposition revealed a hierarchical organization: large-scale plane waves (mediating global propagation) dominate, complemented by local patterns for local computation. Dominant plane wave directions correlate with underlying white matter fibre tract orientations, indicating anatomical guidance of cortical dynamics. Velocity field singularities (sources, sinks, spirals and saddles) are non-randomly distributed, associating with default mode network (DMN) hubs. We further identified a nonlinear relationship between cortical wave speed and age, with developmental phases paralleling white matter maturation and aging. Our findings link cortical wave dynamics to anatomy, functional networks, and neurodevelopment, establishing wave speed as a potential yet important biomarker for brain function and health.",

      "content": "Haptic wearables provide an intuitive human-machine interface to convey information through the sense of touch, which may have promising applications in guided breathing. In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

      "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
      "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

      "title": "A Survey on Tactile Change Blindness",
      "content": "While vibrotactile displays continue to gain popularity, it remains that the phenomenon of tactile change blindness negatively impacts the human ability to detect changes between and within tactile signals. This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",
