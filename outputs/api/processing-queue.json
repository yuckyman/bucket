      "title": "Conserved phenotype and function of human brain border-associated macrophages in iPSC-derived models",
      "content": "Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) are increasingly implicated in protective brain functions including the removal of pathogenic material such as amyloid-beta. However, there is a lack of available and deeply characterized human BAM models. Here, we report that postnatal transplantation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hematopoietic progenitors to the murine brain sufficiently chimerizes the brain border immune compartment to allow functional interrogations. Human xenotransplanted BAMs (xBAMs) line the leptomeninges and brain vasculature beyond the glia limitans. Via single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that a conserved transcriptional signature distinguishes BAMs from microglia across species origin, age, and genetic background. Both xBAMs and murine BAMs are defined by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and function, surpass other brain macrophages in acute amyloid-beta scavenging, and exhibit compartment-restricted sampling of parenchymal material. Using a modified differentiation protocol, we find that we can generate iPS-derived BAM-like cells (iBAMs) in vitro, which are also characterized by a hyper-endocytic phenotype and enhanced engulfment capacity relative to iPS-derived microglia-like cells (iMGLs). Together, these data define a conserved hyper-endocytic BAM phenotype and provide a toolbox for studying human BAMs both in vivo and in vitro.",

      "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
      "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

      "title": "Short Excitatory Projections Promote Burst Activity and Modular Functional Organization in Neural Networks",
      "content": "Physical constraints in the brain favor short, distance-dependent connections. However, short-range projections are not merely a compromise imposed by these constraints; they also serve essential functional roles. Here, we explore networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, demonstrating that short excitatory projections fundamentally increase the number of common presynaptic inputs, thereby enhancing the correlations of neural responses. Strengthened recurrent correlations can lead to bursting states, amplifying postsynaptic neuronal activity and supporting signal propagation over long distances within the network. Moreover, even without an explicitly imposed modular structure, short excitatory connections can give rise to functional clustering and support a broad spectrum of modular functions. Therefore, this structural principle provides a mechanistic basis for functional column formation and dynamic burst propagation, suggesting that the brain transforms structural wiring constraints into opportunities for complex computation and distributed processing. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of how the brain transforms structural limitations into opportunities for complex computation.",

      "title": "EEG Reveals Robust Within-Person but Unstable Between-Person Neural Encoding of Pain",
      "content": "The perception of pain varies both within and between individuals, even when sensory input remains constant. Understanding how the brain encodes these intra- and interindividual variations is essential for elucidating the neural mechanisms of pain in health and disease. Yet, previous findings have been inconsistent, and their robustness, in terms of both repeatability and replicability, has remained unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in 161 healthy participants to re-investigate the neural correlates of intra- and inter-individual variations in the perception of brief painful stimuli, independent of stimulus intensity. Using Bayesian multivariate multi-model regression, we related pain ratings to evoked (N1, N2, P2) and induced oscillatory responses (alpha, beta, gamma). To assess the robustness of our findings, the experiment was repeated after four weeks in the same participants and replicated in an independent cohort (n = 111). This design allowed us to examine within-person variability at both short (moment-to-moment) and long (day-to-day) timescales. Inter-individual differences in pain were primarily associated with the P2 response, an effect that was repeatable in the same but not replicable in the independent cohort. In contrast, intra-individual variations were explained by a multicomponent EEG pattern that was both repeatable across time and replicable across cohorts. These findings demonstrate that intra- and inter-individual variability in pain is differentially encoded in the human brain and reveal greater robustness of within-person brain-behavior associations. EEG markers may therefore be more suitable for tracking longitudinal changes in pain within individuals than for comparing pain sensitivity across individuals.",

      "title": "A frontal motor circuit for economic decisions and actions",
      "content": "Flexible behaviour requires transforming abstract cognitive representations, such as value preferences, into concrete motor actions. During economic decision-making, individuals evaluate options to guide choices and then transform these choices into specific actions to obtain rewards, yet the neural circuit mechanisms linking abstract choices to spatial actions remain unclear. Here we show that a frontal motor network performs this transformation through dynamic circuit reconfiguration across decision stages. Using a mouse task that temporally dissociates value-guided decisions from spatial action planning, cortex-wide optogenetic perturbations revealed that a specific frontal motor circuit was causally required for both abstract and motor stages of choice. Electrophysiological recordings during abstract decision-making showed that frontal motor neurons encoded option values and economic choices independently of sensorimotor contingencies, and unilateral silencing impaired decisions without spatial bias. During spatial planning, value and spatial signals were integrated to guide action selection, and unilateral silencing produced an ipsilateral bias. A dynamical model captured this transformation, predicting a shift from distributed interhemispheric maintenance of economic choice to lateralized control of actions, which we validated with simultaneous bilateral recordings. These findings demonstrate how frontal motor circuits reconfigure their interactions to convert cognitive decisions into motor actions, providing a circuit-level mechanism for flexible, value-guided behaviour.",

      "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "The hierarchical organization of human praxis: A lesion-connectome mapping study of limb and oral apraxias",
      "content": "The neural architecture underlying apraxias remains a complex puzzle. While primary motor cortices exhibit clear somatotopic organization, it is unclear whether this segregation extends to the higher-order networks governing skilled actions. Furthermore, the dissociation between verbal (apraxia of speech, AOS) and non-verbal (buccofacial apraxia, BFA) oral motor control remains debated. We investigated the neuroanatomical substrates of limb apraxia (LA), BFA, and AOS in 136 patients with acute left-hemisphere ischemic stroke using voxel-based, region-of-interest-based, and connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping. Our results revealed a fundamental anatomical dissociation extending beyond simple effector specificity. LA was associated with damage to the inferior parietal lobule and widespread white matter disconnections, specifically involving intra-hemispheric temporo-parietal pathways and massive inter-hemispheric transcallosal fibers. In contrast, BFA was attributable to focal cortical lesions centered on the ventral precentral and postcentral gyri, without significant involvement of long-range white matter tracts. AOS showed no significant lesion overlap at the population level, suggesting a highly focal etiology distinct from the premotor patterns of BFA. These findings indicate that LA and BFA differ not only in their effectors but in their network dependency: LA relies on a distributed, bilaterally integrated temporo-parietal network for multimodal action control, whereas BFA depends on localized proprioceptive-motor loops in the ventral sensorimotor cortex. This study provides a structural framework for the hierarchical organization of human praxis, distinguishing between distributed network disconnections and focal cortical dysfunctions.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>!</p> <p>I just built and released a new open-source project: <strong>Pydantic-DeepAgents</strong> \u2013 a Python Deep Agent framework built on top of Pydantic-AI.</p> <p>Check out the repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents?referrer=grok.com\">https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents</a></p> <p>Stars, forks, and PRs are welcome if you're interested!</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong><br /> Pydantic-DeepAgents is a framework that enables developers to rapidly build and deploy production-grade autonomous AI agents. It extends Pydantic-AI by providing advanced agent capabilities such as planning, filesystem operations, subagent delegation, and customizable skills. Agents can process tasks autonomously, handle file uploads, manage long conversations through summarization, and support human-in-the-loop workflows. It includes multiple backends for state management (e.g., in-memory, filesystem, Docker sandbox), rich toolsets for tasks like to-do lists and skills, structured outputs via Pydantic models, and full streaming support for responses.</p> <p>Key features include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Multiple Backends</strong>: StateBackend (in-memory), FilesystemBackend, DockerSandbox, CompositeBackend</li> <li><strong>Rich Toolsets</strong>: TodoToolset, FilesystemToolset, SubAgentToolset, SkillsToolset</li> <li><strong>File Uploads</strong>: Upload files for agent processing with run_with_files() or deps.upload_file()</li> <li><strong>Skills System</strong>: Extensible skill definitions with markdown prompts</li> <li><strong>Structured Output</strong>: Type-safe responses with Pydantic models via output_type</li> <li><strong>Context Management</strong>: Automatic conversation summarization for long sessions</li> <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop</strong>: Built-in support for human confirmation workflows</li> <li><strong>Streaming</strong>: Full streaming support for agent responses</li> </ul> <p>I've also included a demo application built on this framework \u2013 check out the full app example in the repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full_app?referrer=grok.com\">https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full_app</a></p> <p>Plus, here's a quick demo video: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing&amp;referrer=grok.com\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing</a></p> <p>And don't miss the screenshot in the README for a visual overview!</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> Compared to popular open-source agent frameworks like LangChain or CrewAI, Pydantic-DeepAgents is more tightly integrated with Pydantic for type-safe, structured data handling, making it lighter-weight and easier to extend for production use. Unlike AutoGen (which focuses on multi-agent collaboration), it emphasizes deep agent features like customizable skills and backends (e.g., Docker sandbox for isolation), while avoiding the complexity of larger ecosystems. It's an extension of Pydantic-AI, so it inherits its simplicity but adds agent-specific tools that aren't native in base Pydantic-AI or simpler libraries like Semantic Kernel.</p> <p>Thanks! \ud83d\ude80</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VanillaOk4593\"> /u/VanillaOk4593 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pm6pu5/pydanticdeepagents_autonomous_agents_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pm6pu5/pydanticdeepagents_autonomous_agents_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Integrative Analysis of Spatial Transcriptome and Connectome by SpaCon",
      "content": "The brain's structure and function arise from its complex molecular composition and neural connectivity, yet the relationship between cell-type-specific gene expression and brain-wide connectivity is not well understood. By integrating single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomics and connectomics, we reveal a tight coupling between gene expression and anatomical connectivity in the cortico-thalamic circuit, and identify specific gene expression in axons of the corpus callosum that reflect their cortical origins. Building on these findings, we developed SpaCon, a graph attention autoencoder that uses a tunable hyperparameter to flexibly integrate global connectivity with local gene expression. To enable analysis at the whole-brain scale, SpaCon introduces an efficient neighbor sampling strategy that drastically reduces computational requirements without compromising performance. This architecture allows the model to identify functionally relevant three-dimensional domains defined by both molecular identity and shared connectivity patterns, even when spatially distant. Validated across diverse datasets and species, SpaCon significantly enhances the prediction of connectivity from gene expression and improves the spatial classification of neuronal subtypes. SpaCon thus provides a powerful, scalable, and versatile framework for understanding the complex relationship between transcriptome and connectome.",

      "title": "Intra- and Interhemispheric Signatures of Criticality at the Onset of Synchronization",
      "content": "The cerebral cortex must flexibly alternate between locally segregated activity that supports specialization and long-range interactions that enable integration. How cortical networks balance these competing demands remains unclear. We propose that fluctuations around a critical point between ordered and disordered phases provide a natural framework to understand coordinated neuronal activity across scales. Using simultaneous spiking recordings from the left and right prefrontal cortex (PFC) of freely behaving rats, we found that signatures of criticality emerged at the onset of neuronal synchronization, both locally within individual hemispheres and globally across the combined population. Over time, cortical activity explored a continuum of intra- and interhemispheric synchrony levels, including states in which neurons were locally desynchronized yet maintained interhemispheric coupling. A computational model operating near its critical regime reproduced these empirical patterns, capturing the characteristic relationship between local and long-range coordination. These results suggest that cortical networks achieve flexible transitions between local and global computation by fluctuating around a critical regime.",
