      "title": "Spinal Mechanisms in Post-Activation Potentiation: Facilitation of Presynaptic Inhibition Contrasts H-Reflex Amplitude Reduction",
      "content": "This study investigated the spinal neural mechanisms underlying post-activation potentiation in ten healthy young males (21.9 {+/-} 4.8 years). Participants performed a 10-second maximal isometric plantarflexion, after which we measured twitch torque and assessed spinal excitability using the soleus H-reflex, D1 presynaptic inhibition and heteronymous Ia facilitation (HF). High-density surface EMG was decomposed to track single motor unit responses. The conditioning contraction increased twitch torque by 12.2 Nm (p < 0.001) immediately and returning to baseline within nine minutes. This mechanical potentiation was accompanied by a 29% reduction in H-reflex amplitude (p < 0.001), which recovered within three minutes. Paradoxically, neurophysiological indices of presynaptic inhibition, D1 and HF were significantly increased (D1: p<0.017; HF: p<0.001), resulting in spinal facilitation. Single MU analysis revealed increased discharge probability, particularly in higher-threshold units indicating overall spinal facilitation. These results demonstrate that post-activation potentiation involves a complex dissociation: H-reflex pathway inhibition along facilitation of presynaptic spinal mechanisms. This paradox can be explained by either post-activation depression (caused by depletion of neurotransmitter at the Ia motoneuron synapse) or muscle thixotropy, a contraction history-dependent decrease in muscle spindle sensitivity, which reduces the efficacy of the Ia afferent volley independently of spinal inhibitory mechanisms. Our findings highlight a dissociation between spinal presynaptic facilitation and the depressed H-reflex, underscoring the need for future studies to explicitly test the roles of post-activation depression and muscle thixotropy during post-activation potentiation.",

      "content": "Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) is characterized by neuropathic pain accompanied by loss of sensory function. We hypothesized that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) could underlie DPN progression. To address this question, we performed multi-omic evaluation on DRGs from otherwise healthy organ donors, donors with diabetes but no neuropathy, and donors with clinically diagnosed DPN. We discovered that the first stages of neurodegeneration begin early in diabetes before the onset of DPN, with Nageotte nodule formation accompanied by apoptotic gene expression and decreased proportion of specific populations of A-fibers in DPN with remodeling of non-neuronal cells. Our findings define DPN as a neurodegenerative disorder of the DRG, identify molecular markers of disease stage, and highlight the need for early intervention to prevent irreversible neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Evaluating the reliability of functional near-infrared spectroscopy data in the context of a reasoning paradigm",
      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, motion-tolerant neuroimaging method particularly well suited for developmental and naturalistic research. To evaluate the utility of fNIRS for studying individual differences and longitudinal changes, we measured activation and functional connectivity during a relational reasoning task in young adults (N = 73). We sought to (1) establish whether fNIRS captures frontoparietal activation patterns consistent with prior fMRI studies using similar paradigms, (2) assess the effect of the amount of data (number of task blocks) on signal strength and precision, (3) assess the paradigm's measurement properties in the form of intra- and interindividual stability of activation and functional connectivity within and across testing sessions, and (4) examine whether grouping channels into anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) conferred benefits to the above. We observed robust task-evoked activation across lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, with effect sizes on par with prior fMRI studies. Generally, we observed diminishing returns in effect size and measurement precision beyond ~7 minutes. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability varied across metrics; while they were very low for a specific task contrast, they were extremely high for functional connectivity, confirming the robustness of channel- and ROI-level connectivity as a stable marker of functional architecture. Exploratory analyses supported prior observations of lower signal quality in participants with darker skin tones and hair, underscoring the need for inclusive methodological strategies. Together, these findings highlight key design considerations for optimizing longitudinal and individual-differences research on higher-level cognition, particularly in diverse and developmentally variable populations.",

      "content": "Nerve Injury-Induced Protein 1 (Ninjurin-1) is an adhesion molecule implicated in inflammation and tissue injury, yet its role in neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly defined. Here, we identify Ninjurin-1 as a key mediator of immune activation and CNS infiltration in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE), a model of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Using flow cytometry, gene-expression profiling, and in vivo peptide blockade, we show that Ninjurin-1 is markedly upregulated on CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells during disease progression. Ninjurin-1 myeloid cells display a dual function, as both an adhesion molecule and a marker of inflammatory activation, characterized by increased antigen presentation, cytokine production, and transcriptional enrichment for genes regulating adhesion, migration, and innate immune signaling. Importantly, therapeutic blockade of Ninjurin-1 significantly reduced clinical severity, CNS immune infiltration, and demyelination in RR-EAE. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for Ninjurin-1 in myeloid-driven neuroinflammation and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for relapsing-remitting MS.",

The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "PD-1-Dependent Modulation of Sensory Neurons by a Staphylococcus epidermidis Lipoteichoic Acid Drives Analgesia",
      "content": "The immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, traditionally known for suppressing T-cell activation, is also expressed in peripheral sensory neurons where it limits excitability, but the physiological contexts in which neuronal PD-1 is engaged remain poorly defined. We previously identified a purified Staphylococcus epidermidis lipoteichoic acid analog (SELTA) that rapidly alleviates pelvic pain in mice. Here, we investigated whether SELTA functions as an exogenous activator of neuronal PD-1 and whether PD-1 is required for its analgesic effects. SELTA increased Pdcd1 transcripts and PD-1 protein in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and prostate-innervating sensory fibers, and colocalized with TLR2 at neuronal membranes where it enhanced PD-1 Y248 phosphorylation. In primary DRG cultures, SELTA suppressed ATP-evoked calcium responses, indicating reduced neuronal excitability. This effect was abolished by PD-1 neutralization but restored when neutralization was blocked by a PD-1 control peptide, demonstrating both PD-1 dependence and specificity. In male mice with chronic pelvic allodynia induced by experimental autoimmune prostatitis, intraurethral SELTA produced robust, concentration-dependent, and repeatable reductions in tactile hypersensitivity. Sensory neuron-specific PD-1 conditional knockout mice showed normal baseline behavior but failed to respond to SELTA, confirming that PD-1 expression in nociceptors is essential for SELTA-mediated analgesia. These findings identify SELTA as a commensal-derived activator of neuronal PD-1 signaling. Through TLR2 engagement, PD-1 phosphorylation, and suppression of excitatory calcium signaling, SELTA attenuates nociceptor activation and reduces pelvic pain. This mechanism highlights neuronal PD-1 as a modifiable checkpoint pathway and a promising non-opioid target for chronic pain therapy.",
