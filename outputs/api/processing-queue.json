      "title": "PRO-FitS: a novel phenotypic assay to identify enhancers of proteostasis in C. elegans",
      "content": "The prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) continues to rise with the aging of populations worldwide, representing a pressing need for the establishment of therapeutic strategies. Maintaining proteostasis is crucial for healthy aging, as the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins is a key contributor to age-related cellular dysfunction and disease. This study introduces a novel phenotypic assay using Caenorhabditis elegans to screen for small molecule enhancers of proteostasis, aiming at mitigating the proteotoxic stress associated with NDs. This new methodology- PRO-FitS- uses C. elegans motor activity as a proxy for the PROteome Fitness State upon a noxious protein-denaturating stimulus, while allowing a fast and experimenter-free readout. We demonstrate the efficacy of the assay by validating the role of pharmacological mTOR inhibition and serotonergic signaling activation in reducing heat shock-induced proteotoxic damage at the whole-organism level. PRO-FitS will allow the identification of novel compounds that alleviate protein aggregation disorders, potentially revealing new pathways and cellular targets not previously implicated in proteotoxicity.",

      "title": "Exogenously driven neural reactivation of spatially matching visual working-memory contents",
      "content": "Selective attention is often divided into voluntary (goal-directed) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) forms, a distinction extensively studied for attention to external sensory input. In contrast, internal selective attention--directed toward representations held in working memory (WM)--has been considered primarily for voluntary influences. Recent behavioral evidence suggests that task-irrelevant external stimuli can also influence internal selection of feature-matching WM representations involuntarily, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Here, we tested whether an uninformative exogenous spatial retro-cue presented during a WM delay can act as a selective ''ping'' and reactivate spatially matching WM content at the level of its representational category. Male and female human participants memorized complex contents presented at distinct locations, followed by unpredictive and task-irrelevant spatial retro-cues that conveyed no category information. Using temporally resolved multivariate EEG decoding, we observed category-specific reactivation of spatially matching WM representations following these cues, providing direct neural evidence for stimulus-driven, involuntary attentional selection within WM, ahead of the memory test. Moreover, neural responses to the subsequent memory-probe were also modulated by cue congruency, consistent with the notion that exogenous influences begin early during sensory processing while also shaping later decision-related processes. Finally, drift-diffusion model analyses revealed that this involuntary cueing effect was primarily driven by increased evidence accumulation. Together, these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which external events can automatically and involuntarily penetrate the internal cognitive workspace.",

      "title": "State-Dependent Dissociation of Shared Input and Directed Information Flow in the Visual Cortex",
      "content": "Understanding how brain state and sensory input shape inter-laminar communication is essential for interpreting cortical population dynamics. Using laminar recordings in macaque V1, we apply reduced-rank regression to quantify low-dimensional predictive subspaces linking Input and Superficial layers. We find that both visual stimulation and internal state (eyes open vs. closed) modulate the structure and efficacy of these subspaces, but through distinct mechanisms. Visual input induces a directional, feedforward pattern from input to superficial layers, while wakefulness-related modulation enhances coordination more symmetrically. Delay analysis and network simulations confirm that structured, layer-specific inputs produce directional prediction, whereas global fluctuations yield undirected co-activation. Importantly, differential structure across layers predicts the emergence of communication asymmetry. These findings dissociate communication from shared modulation, providing a principled framework for interpreting inter-population correlations. Our results generalize to broader cortical circuits, offering insights into when population coupling reflects genuine information flow versus global state dynamics.",

      "title": "Ketone bodies mitigate against systemic inflammation-induced changes in brain energy metabolism and delirium-like deficits in aged mice",
      "content": "Acute systemic inflammation affects brain function, with detrimental consequences in aged individuals. These include delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by fluctuating disturbances in attention, perception and cognition. Delirium is associated with disrupted brain energy metabolism but our understanding of this during acute systemic inflammation is limited. Here we hypothesized that LPS-induced systemic inflammation would disrupt brain energy metabolism in aged C57BL6J mice and that the consequent functional impairments would be mitigated by ketone body utilization. We investigated ketone body effects in sickness behaviour, inflammation, energy metabolism and cognitive function. Real-time changes in utilisation of energy sources were quantified by indirect calorimetry and administration of radioisotope-labelled glucose and betahydroxybutyrate. Mass-spectrometry metabolomics was used to index severity of behavioural distrurbances to changes in hippocampal energy metabolism. LPS precipitated hypoglycemia and induced a whole-body switch from carbohydrate to lipid utilisation. Despite this, hippocampal insulin resistance and preserved brain glucose was observed while alternative carbohydrates, mannose and fructose, became depleted. Ketone ester treatment reversed insulin resistance, mitigated sickness behaviour and prevented delirium-like cognitive dysfunction without altering pro-inflammatory responses. Our results show that promoting ketone body usage mitigates systemic inflammation-induced brain energy disruption and prevents delirium-like cognitive deficits in aged mice.",

      "title": "\u0394\u2079-Tetrahydrocannabinol-induced enhancement of reward responsivity via mesocorticolimbic modulation in squirrel monkeys",
      "content": "Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products are widely used recreationally, partly due to THC's ability to enhance the appetitive (i.e., rewarding) properties of diverse stimuli. However, the neural mechanisms through which THC modulates reward-related processing remain poorly understood. Here, we used a Pavlovian paradigm in adult squirrel monkeys (3males, 1female) to associate a visual conditioned stimulus (CS+) with appetitive food delivery. The modulatory effects of acute THC (1-10g/kg, i.m.) on behavioral and brain responses to CS+ were evaluated. Event-related functional MRI (fMRI) was employed to characterize the neural correlates of conditioned responding to the CS+, both in the absence and presence of THC treatment, with pre-conditioning scans serving as control. Behaviorally, THC (3g/kg) selectively enhanced conditioned responding to the CS+ without altering responses to the control stimulus (CS-) or increasing baseline consummatory responding, underscoring the specificity of THC's action on reward-associated processes. Consistently, fMRI analyses revealed that THC amplified CS+-evoked activation within mesocorticolimbic regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, hippocampus, and substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA), without affecting activity in visual and motor cortices. This finding underscores the selectivity of THC's neuromodulatory effects on reward-related circuitry. Independent of CS exposure, resting-state functional connectivity analyses indicate that THC enhanced mesocorticolimbic network integration, as evident in strengthened SN-VTA-centered connectivity with the ACC, striatum, and hippocampus. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that THC enhances the responses to appetitive stimuli, through selective modulation of mesocorticolimbic circuitry, highlighting the SN-VTA as a pivotal hub for cannabinoid-mediated regulation of incentive salience and motivational drive toward reward-associated stimuli.",

      "title": "Hippocampal tangential insertions of high-density silicone probes in head-fixed mice enhance spatial sampling",
      "content": "The hippocampus is a key structure within the medial temporal lobe which plays a central role in the formation and consolidation of declarative memories. Despite technological progress, a full understanding of hippocampal rhythms, neuronal population activity, and the underlying connectivity remain elusive, partly due to its complex morphology in a croissant-like shape which limits coronal and sagittal approaches. To address this limitation, we propose two different tangential insertions of high-density electrode probes aligned to either the dorsal or ventral sections of the hippocampus. Each approach enables the placement of up to 384 recording sites within the hippocampal formation. Both insertions are performed in head-fixed condition, which further allows for detailed monitoring of the animals behavioral states, including spontaneous running and facial movements. The two proposed tangential dorsal and ventral insertions capture almost continuously the physiology of the hippocampus across 3.84 mm of tissue. When placed across the pyramidal layer, such insertions can harness ripple oscillations over 120 channels, corresponding to approximately ~1.2 mm of tissue, with a coverage of 2 channels every 20 micrometer. Furthermore, such insertions enabled us to record up to 400 hippocampal neurons simultaneously from a single probe, endowing us with the capability to capture within a single recording several hundreds of functionally connected neuronal pairs. Lastly, these insertions were performed in head-fixed mice on a running band, which can be combined with high frequency sampling camera, allowing us to precisely monitor facial movements, and their hippocampal correlates. An orthogonal/vertical approach is a more standard way to record electrophysiological activity from most brain regions, including the hippocampus. Vertical insertions thereby miss the antero-posterior axis of the brain in the hippocampus and therefore putative propagating events. Furthermore, vertical insertions have a lower reach in terms of number of channels, single units, and spatial density being recorded, even with multi-shank high-density probes. Tangential insertions therefore substantially increase spatial reach and resolution, which leads to a higher number of cells recorded in a single insertion along the antero-posterior axis of the hippocampus. Furthermore, compared to freely moving approaches, head-fixed conditions enable precise monitoring of facial movements. Dorsal and ventral head-fixed tangential insertions of Neuropixels probes in the hippocampus increase the resolution and spatial extent of recordings, allowing more precise and extensive monitoring of network activity and its underlying connectivity.",

      "title": "Virtual prototyping of non-invasive spinal cord electrical stimulation targeting upper limb motor function",
      "content": "Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) applied over the cervical or lumbar spinal cord facilitates motor function after paralysis. However, emerging electrophysiological evidence indicates mechanistic differences between cervical and lumbar tSCS and across different cervical tSCS paradigms. To clarify these discrepancies, we developed and validated a multi-scale, whole-body computational model of tSCS-induced volume conduction, axonal recruitment, and synaptic transmission. Across 24 cervical and four lumbar tSCS paradigms, simulations showed that somatosensory afferents consistently exhibit lower stimulation thresholds than motor efferents. In turn, region-specific synaptic transmission differences may explain electrophysiological discrepancies between cervical and lumbar tSCS. Across cervical tSCS paradigms, substantial volume conduction and axonal recruitment differences were observed that explain electrophysiological discrepancies. Specifically, clinically-prevalent paradigms, including those with anodes placed over the clavicles or iliac crests, engaged peripheral nerves in addition to spinal roots. This effect was amplified by multiphasic waveforms, which introduced recruitment sites near the anodes. By integrating simulations with electrophysiological recordings in 14 able-bodied individuals, we investigated previously unexplored cervical tSCS paradigms on their capacity to recruit somatosensory afferents relative to motor threshold.",

      "title": "When the brightest is not the best: illuminant estimation from the geometry of specular highlights",
      "content": "Color constancy allows us to perceive stable object colors under different lighting conditions by reducing the impact of lighting. Information about illuminant color could be derived from a white surface or a specular highlight. The 'brightest is white' heuristic has been frequently incorporated in illumination estimation models, to identify illuminant color. Here, we tested an alternative hypothesis: we use structured changes in the proximal image to identify highlight regions, even when they are not the brightest elements in the scene. In computer-rendered scenes, we varied the reliability of 'brightest element' and 'highlight geometry' cues, testing their effect on a color constancy task. Each scene had a single spherical surface lit by several point lights with identical spectral properties. The surface had a uniform spectral reflectance but a noise texture that attenuated the reflectance by a variable scale factor. We tested three levels of specularity: zero (matte), low, and mid. Observers watched a 1.5-second animation and responded if color changes were due to illuminant or material changes. Discrimination performance for matte surfaces was nearly at chance level, as predicted. However, as specularity increased, performance improved significantly. Observers outperformed an ideal observer model who relied solely on the brightest element. Notably, when the specular region appeared on a dark part of the texture, observer performance improved even more even though the brightest element heuristic would predict a decrease. When specular geometries were difficult to identify due to phase scrambling, observer performance significantly dropped. These results suggest that we do not simply rely on the brightest element, but rather utilize regularities of diffuse and specular components of the proximal image to solve surface and illuminant ambiguities.",

      "title": "Uncovering Dynamic Neural Information Flow with Continuous-Time Weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks",
      "content": "Understanding how information dynamically flows within neural systems is a crucial problem in neuroscience. Traditional approaches often assume stationary or quasi-stationary functional networks, which fail to capture the time-varying dynamics of interactions among neural variables. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous-Time weighted Dynamic Bayesian Networks (CTwDBN), a non-stationary graphical modeling framework for uncovering smoothly time-varying conditional dependencies. Validation on synthetic datasets demonstrated that CTwDBN reliably recovers the structure and dynamics of ground-truth information flow. Application to electrophysiological recordings during a guided saccade task revealed temporal fluctuations in conditional dependencies in the cortical network that persisted an order of magnitude longer than the receptive field dynamics. In the resting-state cortex, CTwDBN revealed persistent fluctuations within a low-dimensional dependency space reflecting canonical anatomical motifs. These results highlight CTwDBN as a versatile analytical framework for capturing dynamic information flow in neural systems with broad applicability to complex biological and artificial systems.",

      "content": "This study presents a stereotactic microbiopsy technique for sampling defined brain regions in living mice, enabling transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses without sacrificing the animal. The method will allow pre-intervention tissue collection, making it possible to separate preexisting molecular differences from experience- or treatment-induced changes. We show that microbiopsies yield sufficient, high-quality RNA and chromatin for sequencing, with minimal tissue damage that largely resolves over time. The procedure uses standard stereotactic equipment and achieves reproducible spatial precision when the syringe is stabilised. This approach provides a practical framework for within-subject molecular comparisons, reducing animal use and enabling longitudinal profiling of the living mouse brain. It establishes a foundation for investigating how baseline molecular states influence later physiological or behavioural outcomes.",
