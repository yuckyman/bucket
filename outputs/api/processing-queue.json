      "title": "Therapeutic Potential of Flavonoids and Rutin Against Inflammation on a Huntington Animal Model",
      "content": "This study tested the hypothesis that flavonoids (diosmine, hesperidin and rutin(R)) play a protective role in the brain and duodenum against 3-NPA's free radical induced inflammation. This was achieved by measuring the levels of GABA, 5-HIAA, dopamine and some inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Male young Wistar rats (weight 60g) received Salmonella thyphimurium ATCC14028 1x106 CFU/g every week, for two consecutive weeks, plus the following treatments: group A, 9% NaCl 0. (Control); group B, diomine (300mg) + hesperidin (33.3g) + rutin (150mg/kg); group C, 3-NPA; group D, 3-NPA + mix of flavonoids with 1ml of rutin(R) per rat. 3-NPA administration was at 24mg/kgW by intraperitoneal route and the flavonoids were orally administered at every 48 hours for 15 days. At the moment of euthanasia, the blood was obtained to assess Interleukine-6, glucose, triglycerides and hemoglobin levels. Brain and duodenum were obtained to measure GABA, dopamine, 5-HIAA, lipoperoxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), total ATPase concentrations and catalase activity using validated methods. The brains, stomach and duodenum were dissected for histological analysis. In group A, there is a decrease in interleukine-6 levels (p=0.009). In the cortex region of animals in group C, dopamine experienced a significant decrease (p=0.012). GABA increased (p=0.001) in cerebellum regions of animals in the groups A, B and C. ATPase activity increased (p = 0.013) in cerebellum regions in animals of groups C and D. Lipoperoxidation diminished (p=0.043) in cerebellum region of group D. Catalase activity diminished (p=0.043) in Cortex region of animals in groups B and D, and (p=0.002) in cerebellum region of animals in groups A and B. Besides, histological changes revealed marked lesions of neuronal cells in experimental animals treated with nitro propionic acid. The protective role of flavonoids and rutin compounds on inhibition of the inflammatory response and correction of the fundamental oxidant/antioxidant imbalance in animals suffering from Huntington diseases are important vistas for further research.",

      "title": "Functional Connectivity Graph Theory Analysis of Spoken Word Processing Efficiency in Prefrontal Cortical Activation",
      "content": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and graph theory analysis of functional connectivity measures derived from hemodynamic changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) can characterize spoken word processing efficiency in neurotypical listeners. Individual differences were assessed by identifying a low performing (Low-P) and a high performing (High-P) individual. Network science and psycholinguistic models of spoken word recognition predict that word frequency and sublexical phonotactic probability of the word form affects the cognitive processing effort. This novel study assesses predictors of processing efficiency directly using functional connectivity measures of global efficiency, local efficiency, modularity, and hubness, derived from listener's frontal lobe hemodynamic response function during a verbal working memory task. Method: A total of 20 neurologically typical participants (ages 18-21) completed an auditory working memory task where participants were required to hold words differing word frequency and sub lexical phonotactic probability in memory. Changes in oxygenated (HbO) and deoxygenated (HbR) hemoglobin concentration were recorded with a continuous-wave, multi-channel fNIRS system (TechEn, Inc., Milford, MA) using a 20-channel optode montage across the prefrontal cortex. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated between each channel pair to produce 20x20 functional connectivity matrices. Frontal networks were constructed as a graph where nodes in the graph are the light source and edges are connections (e.g., channels) between nodes. Functional connectivity strength and graph theory measures were examined. Results: LF and HF words were not processed differently at the behavioral or brain level. Task performance regardless of word frequency was related to brain measures, with higher strength of prefrontal FC relating of worse accuracy (d-prime) regardless of task block, and with high modularity correlating with slow response times on the LF task, measured by HbR signal. Higher efficiencies tended to correspond to better accuracy but none of the tests were significant. High-P showed low FC strength and high efficiency relative to others, while Low-P had high modularity and low efficiency, in line with the direction of the brain-behavior correlations. Lastly, we characterized the centrally important regions (hubs). These tended to be located in the left inferior area. High-P's hubs overlapped with those showing consistent hubs behavior at the group level, while Low-P's hubs were uncommon. Conclusions: We identified network properties related to efficient and inefficient language processing in typical participants, which can be used to assess language function of atypical populations in future studies.",

      "title": "Astrocytic FKBP5 Regulates Neuroinflammation and Cognitive Outcomes in Excitotoxic Brain Injury",
      "content": "FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51, encoded by FKBP5) is a multisignaling cochaperone that regulates cellular responses to stress. FKBP51 is upregulated in reactive astrocytes; however, the role of FKBP51 in excitotoxic brain injury remains unknown. Here, we investigated how both global and astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 deletion influence seizure susceptibility, astrogliosis, neuroinflammation, and cognition in male mice subjected to a kainic acid (KA)-induced epilepsy mouse model. Global Fkbp5 knockout (Fkbp5-KO) presented lower seizure activity along with decreased neuronal loss and astrogliosis in the hippocampus compared with the wild-type mice. Astrocyte-specific Fkbp5 conditional knockout (aFkbp5-cKO) mice similarly attenuated seizure severity, decreased astrogliosis, improved novel object recognition, and preserved glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression in hippocampal CA3. Glia-neuron mixed cultures derived from Fkbp5-KO brains showed reduction of NMDA-induced neurotoxicity, astrogliosis, accompanied by decreased NF-{kappa}B p65 phosphorylation. Notably, overexpression of an Fkbp5 quadruple mutant that disrupts the FKBP51-NF-{kappa}B interaction inhibited proinflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced astrogliosis and NF-{kappa}B activation. The hippocampal transcriptome of the LPS-treated Fkbp5-KO mice revealed suppression of NF-{kappa}B signaling. In summary, this study highlights FKBP51 as a key mediator of excitotoxin-induced neuroinflammation and GLT-1 dysfunction and underlines NF-{kappa}B-mediated inflammatory astrogliosis as a potential intervention target for excitotoxic brain injury.",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Lemborexant Reduces Infarct Volume and Improves Long-Term Functional Recovery in a Murine Model of Ischemic Stroke",
      "content": "Introduction: Recovery following ischemic stroke is highly variable and often incomplete, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel targeted poststroke treatments. While the mechanisms underlying poststroke recovery remain incompletely understood, sleep fragmentation, a common consequence of stroke, has been linked to worse patient outcomes. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by suppressing wakefulness and enhancing sleep continuity. We hypothesized that lemborexant would reduce poststroke sleep disturbances and promote recovery in a rodent model of stroke. Methods: We examined the effects of lemborexant (10mg/kg and 30mg/kg) and zolpidem (30 mg/kg) on sleep macrostructure, fragmentation, and EEG spectra in both healthy mice and in stroke model mice, which underwent photothrombotic ischemia of the forelimb somatosensory cortex. We also evaluated whether 12 days of drug administration altered infarct volume and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice. Results: Lemborexant treatment (30mg/kg) increased the percentage of NREM sleep, while preserving sleep continuity, in both healthy and stroke model mice. In contrast, zolpidem increased NREM sleep after stroke, but also increased sleep fragmentation in both groups. Lemborexant treatment at 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg significantly reduced infarct volume eight weeks after the induction of stroke. In addition, lemborexant-treated mice showed greater use of the impaired limb four weeks after stroke. Interpretation: These preclinical findings suggest that lemborexant stabilizes sleep and promotes structural and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention following ischemic stroke.",
