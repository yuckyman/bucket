      "title": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis drives stroke-associated pneumonia: mechanisms and targeted therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a central regulator of immune function, with growing research highlighting its association with the development of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). This review provides an overview of current research on the correlation between SAP and alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolism, with a focus on microbial imbalance, changes in key metabolites, and relevant biological mechanisms. Clinical and preclinical studies consistently report a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, an increase in potentially harmful microbial species, reduced SCFAs levels, and elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. These disturbances appear to be associated with SAP progression through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain and microbiota\u2013gut\u2013lung axes by affecting immune regulation and inflammatory responses. The review also examines microbiota-targeted treatment approaches, including dietary modification, antibiotic therapy, probiotics, microbiota-regulating compounds, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and respiratory microbiota transfer. A deeper understanding of how microbial disturbances are correlated with SAP may help explain the increased vulnerability to pulmonary infections following stroke and support the design of more effective, microbiota-based therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Reversible splenial lesion syndrome associated with Graves\u2019 disease and hepatic dysfunction: a case report",
      "content": "BackgroundReversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) has been confirmed to induce severe psychiatric symptoms. This syndrome is a rare clinical condition with an etiology that remains unclear. According to current literature, the primary cause of RESLES may be associated with cytotoxic cerebral edema. First reported in 1999, reversible splenial syndrome may be triggered by bacterial or viral infections, epileptic seizures, metabolic disorders, hyperosmolar cerebral edema, and other factors. In this study, we report the case of RESLES in a patient with Graves\u2019 disease and liver dysfunction.Case presentationThe patient was a 17-year-old female adolescent with persistent headaches, dizziness, and nausea with vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested RESLES as the diagnosis. On admission, the patient presented with elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and positive thyroid-receptor antibodies (TRAb), meeting the diagnostic criteria for Graves\u2019 disease. Concurrently, the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also elevated. After hormone therapy, the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved, and imaging results returned to normal.ConclusionThis study presents a case of a patient with RESLES characterized by Graves\u2019 disease and liver function abnormalities, who was sensitive to anti-thyroid drug (methimazole) and hormone therapy (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) and had a favorable prognosis. This study contributed to expanding the clinical understanding of RESLES and suggests that, in clinical practice, autoimmune hyperthyroidism may be a novel trigger for RESLES, while concurrent liver dysfunction in this context requires further investigation.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo describe two cases of recurrent, delayed-onset severe neutropenia several months following ocrelizumab therapy in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).BackgroundA rare adverse effect of ocrelizumab is neutropenia, with late-onset neutropenia (LON) occurring more rarely. Literature guiding management of transient recurrent neutropenia in the setting of anti-CD20 therapy is lacking.MethodsCase 1: 38-year-old female emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Two years later, she developed severe symptomatic LON and required antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Ocrelizumab was held, patient switched to ozanimod, but neutropenia recurred. Due to concerns of MS progression, ocrelizumab was restarted after the patient transitioned to a telehealth setting, with no recurrence of neutropenia at one-year follow-up. Case 2: 35-year-old male emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab was resumed after absolute neutrophil count recovery. Two years later, he developed moderate symptomatic LON during a suspected viral illness. Ocrevus was discontinued at this point. A subsequent episode occurred 3\u202fmonths later during confirmed rhinovirus infection, again resolving promptly.ConclusionThese cases highlight the unpredictable nature of recurrent LON with ocrelizumab and suggest the possibility of immune-mediated marrow suppression, potentially unmasked or worsened by infections, rather than direct drug toxicity, highlighting the need for clearer management guidelines.",

      "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

      "content": "arXiv:2511.15352v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People increasingly seek personal advice from large language models (LLMs), yet whether humans follow their advice, and its consequences for their well-being, remains unknown. In a longitudinal randomised controlled trial with a representative UK sample (N = 2,302), 75% of participants who had a 20-minute discussion with GPT-4o about health, careers or relationships subsequently reported following its advice. Based on autograder evaluations of chat transcripts, LLM advice rarely violated safety best practice. When queried 2-3 weeks later, participants who had interacted with personalised AI (with access to detailed user information) followed its advice more often in the real world and reported higher well-being than those advised by non-personalised AI. However, while receiving personal advice from AI temporarily reduced well-being, no differential long-term effects compared to a control emerged. Our results suggest that humans readily follow LLM advice about personal issues but doing so shows no additional well-being benefit over casual conversations.",

      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",
