      "title": "Movie-trained transformer reveals novel response properties to dynamic stimuli in mouse visual cortex",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual stimuli remains a fundamental challenge. This study introduces ViV1T, a transformer-based model trained on natural movies to predict neuronal responses in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). ViV1T outperformed state-of-the-art models on both natural and artificial dynamic stimuli, while being faster to run and requiring fewer parameters. Movie-trained ViV1T accurately captured core V1 properties, including orientation and direction selectivity as well as contextual modulation, despite lacking explicit feedback mechanisms. The model also revealed a new subpopulation of neurons that switched its response to iso-oriented surround stimuli from inhibition to excitation between high and low contrasts. Additionally, novel dynamic ViV1T-generated surround stimuli elicited stronger modulatory effects than static images and traditional gratings. We confirmed these predictions through semi-closed-loop in vivo recordings. ViV1T provides a powerful, data-driven framework for understanding how brain sensory areas process dynamic stimuli across space and time.

      "title": "Multi-Source Neural Activity Indices and Spatial Filters for EEG/MEG Inverse Problem: An Extension to MNE-Python",
      "content": "Accurate EEG/MEG source localization is essential for understanding brain function, yet remains challenging because the inverse problem is inherently ill-posed. In spatial filtering (beamforming) approaches, single-source LCMV spatial filters, though widely used, suffer from source cancellation when sources are correlated - a common experimental scenario. Multi-source frameworks, such as the multi-source minimum-variance pseudo-unbiased reduced-rank (MV-PURE) method, offer improved reconstruction and robust neural activity indices, yet their adoption has been limited by incomplete theory and lack of accessible implementations. In this paper, we present a rigorous derivation of multi-source neural activity indices and spatial filters, establishing a complete analytical framework with automated parameter selection. The resulting compact algebraic forms enable straightforward implementation. To facilitate adoption, we provide a full implementation extending MNE-Python, along with an accompanying tutorial, and demonstrate its utility on EEG experimental data, highlighting the practical advantages of multi-source spatial filtering for source localization and reconstruction.",

      "title": "Dual AAV gene therapy using laminin-linking proteins ameliorates muscle and nerve defects in LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy",
      "content": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene replacement holds promise for treating genetic diseases but faces challenges due to AAV's limited packaging capacity and potential immune responses to transgene products, especially in patients lacking endogenous protein. LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2 MD), a severe congenital disorder caused by loss of laminin-2, presents both hurdles: the LAMA2 gene exceeds AAV capacity, and severely affected patients do not produce the native protein. Here, we developed an AAV-based therapy using two engineered linker proteins derived from endogenously expressed components. These linker proteins restore laminin receptor binding and polymerization, enabling reassembly of a functional basement membrane. Dual AAV delivery of the linkers in a severe LAMA2 MD mouse model resulted in robust expression and significant improvements in muscle histology and function. Employing myotropic capsids enabled therapeutic efficacy at lower vector doses. However, muscle-specific targeting unmasked a LAMA2-related peripheral neuropathy. To address this, we expressed one linker under a muscle-specific promoter and the other under a ubiquitous promoter, delivered via AAV9 or AAV8. This approach achieved near-complete phenotypic restoration when administered neonatally and provided significant benefit when given at progressed disease stages. Our strategy offers a mutation-independent, size-compatible, and potentially immune-tolerable treatment for LAMA2 MD with broad clinical potential.",

      "title": "Coincidence detection supported by electrical synapses is shaped by the D-type K+ current",
      "content": "Electrical synapses mediated by gap junctions are widespread in the mammalian brain, playing essential roles in neural circuit function. Beyond their role synchronizing neuronal activity, they also support complex computations such as coincidence detection, a circuit mechanism in which differences in input timing are encoded by the firing rates of coupled neurons, enabling preferential responses to synchronous over temporally dispersed inputs. Electrical coupling allows each neuron to act as a current sink for its partner during independent depolarizations, thereby reducing excitability. In contrast, synchronous inputs across the network minimize voltage differences through gap junctions, reducing current shunting and increasing spiking probability. However, the contribution of intrinsic neuronal properties to coincidence detection remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated this issue in the Mesencephalic Trigeminal (MesV) Nucleus of mice, a structure composed of somatically-coupled neurons. Using whole-cell recordings and pharmacological tools, we examined the role of the D-type K+ current (ID), finding that it critically shapes both the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of MesV neurons and the dynamics of electrical synaptic transmission. Its fast activation kinetics and subthreshold voltage range of activation make ID a key determinant of transmission strength and timing. Furthermore, the ID, likely mediated by Kv1 subunits, is expressed at the soma and the axon initial segment. Finally, we characterized two key parameters of coincidence detection, precision (time window for effective input summation) and gain (differential response to coincident versus dispersed inputs), finding that ID enhances precision by accelerating membrane repolarization and reduces the gain by limiting neuronal excitability.",

      "title": "Novel monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal HEAT domain of Huntingtin",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Reliable detection of huntingtin (HTT) is essential for understanding Huntington's disease (HD) biology and evaluating therapeutic strategies. However, high-quality monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the HTT C-terminal domain remain limited. OBJECTIVE: We sought to generate and validate novel monoclonal antibodies targeting the HTT C-terminal HEAT containing domain to better detect HTT independently of potential effects of polyglutamine length that can impact some N-terminally targeted antibodies. METHODS: We immunized mice with a highly purified, well characterized recombinant protein corresponding to the HTT C-terminal domain. We generated monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma cell lines and characterized the antibodies using parental and HTT-knockout cell lines in common immuno-applications. RESULTS: Three novel, independent hybridoma lines producing anti-HTT monoclonal antibodies were derived. Using CRISPR-edited HTT knockout cell lines we identified one clone, anti-HTT [2F8], that was specific and effective across Western blot, immunofluorescence, and ELISA assays. All antibodies bound full-length HTT irrespective of HAP40 interaction or polyQ length and showed no cross-reactivity to the N-terminal HEAT domain. CONCLUSIONS: These C-terminal HTT mAbs are thus valuable additional tools for studying endogenous HTT function in both normal and disease contexts.",

      "title": "Aging diminishes interlaminar functional connectivity in the mouse cortical V1 and CA1 hippocampal regions",
      "content": "Aging disrupts brain network integration and is a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and neurological diseases, yet the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. Most previous studies have utilized cross-sectional or acute approaches, limiting insights into the longitudinal dynamics of the neural network. In this study, we chronically recorded laminar electrophysiological activity in both the primary visual cortex (V1) and hippocampal CA1 region of young (2-month-old) and aged (13-month-old) mice over 16 weeks. This approach allowed us to directly assess how aging modulates functional connectivity within hierarchically connected cortical and hippocampal circuits. We found that single-unit spiking activity and the signal-to-noise ratio were largely preserved in aged versus young mice, suggesting intact neuronal firing properties. However, aged mice showed global reductions in local field potential (LFP) power and a selective decrease in coherence across delta, alpha-beta, and gamma frequency bands within and between cortical layers and V1-CA1 pathways, while phase amplitude coupling remained unaffected. Interestingly, population level excitatory activity in CA1 was increased in aged animals. These findings indicate that aging selectively impairs network-level synchrony and temporal coordination in specific frequency bands and regions, with minimal loss of single-neuron function. Our results highlight the necessity of longitudinal, multi-region measurements to uncover the multi-scale vulnerabilities of the aging brain. Understanding the depth- and region-dependent circuit changes will guide strategies to preserve cortical-hippocampal communication and cognitive function in aging, as well as enhance neural interface technologies for older populations.",

      "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

      "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
      "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

      "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
      "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",
