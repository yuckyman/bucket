      "title": "Spontaneous neural activity changes in minimal hepatic encephalopathy before and 1 month after liver transplantation",
      "content": "Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is the initial stage of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), MHE patients have associated with widespread neuro-psychological impairment. Liver transplantation (LT) can restore metabolic abnormalities but the mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to longitudinally evaluate brain function alteration in MHE patients one month after LT and their correlation with cognitive changes by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Rs-fMRI data was collected from 32 healthy controls and 27 MHE before and 1 month after LT. Between-group comparisons of demographic data and neuropsychological scores were analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Functional imaging data were analyzed using RESTplus and SPM12 software based on MATLAB 2017b. Gender, age, and years of education were used as covariates to obtain low-frequency fluctuationd (ALFF) and dynamic low-frequency fluctuation (dALFF) dindices. Correlation analyses were performed to explore the relationship between the change of ALFF and dALFF with the change of clinical indexes pre- and post-LT. Compared to controls, ALFF values increased in the Left Cerebelum 8, right orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (ORBinf), right superior occipital gyrus (SOG) and decreased in right PreCG and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in patients post-LT; dALFF values increased in the right temporal pole and middle temporal gyrus (TPOmid), right ORBinf, left caudate nucleus (CAU), right SOG and decreased in left PreCG, left PCUN, left ANG, left SMA and left MFG in patients post-LT. Compared to pre-LT, ALFF values of post-LT patients increased in the right calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex (CAL), right MOG and decreased in right cerebelum 8, left PCUN; dALFF values of post-LT patients decreased in right thalamus (THA), left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and left MFG. The changes of ALFF in the left PCUN, right CAL and right MOG were correlated with change of digit symbol test (DST) scores (P < 0.05). In summary, this study not only showcases the potential of ALFF/dALFF algorithms for assessing alterations in spontaneous neural activity in MHE, but also provides new insights into the altered brain functions in MHE patients 1 month after LT, which may facilitate the elucidation of elucidation of mechanisms underlying cognitive restoration post-LT in MHE patients.",

      "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions. The code is available at https://github.com/WindySprint/DWMamba.",

      "title": "Thyroid nodule and lymph node metastasis assessment from ultrasound images using deep learning",
      "content": "ObjectivesThe preoperative differentiation of thyroid nodules into benign thyroid nodules (BTN), non-metastatic malignant thyroid nodules (NMTN), and metastatic malignant thyroid nodules (MMTN) is critical for guiding clinical management strategies. Ultrasound (US) examinations frequently exhibit diagnostic inconsistencies due to operator-dependent variability. Computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD), an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can help overcome inconsistencies in US examination outcomes by leveraging large-scale ultrasound imaging datasets to improve classification accuracy. Our study aimed to establish and validate this AI-powered ultrasound diagnostic model for precise preoperative discrimination among BTN, NMTN, and MMTN.MethodsA total of 209 patients (BTN\u2009=\u200966, NMTN\u2009=\u200915, and MMTN\u2009=\u2009128) were consecutively identified and enrolled from a multi-center database. A subset of 195 patients (BTN\u2009=\u200960, NMTN\u2009=\u200915, and MMTN\u2009=\u2009120) was selected for final analysis. These patients were divided into two groups: a training set (BTN\u2009=\u200950, NMTN\u2009=\u200911, and MMTN\u2009=\u2009100) and a testing set (BTN\u2009=\u200910, NMTN\u2009=\u20094, and MMTN\u2009=\u200920). A total of 3,537 ultrasound images from the 195 patients were preprocessed by normalizing grayscale values and reducing noise. The processed images were then input into the AI model, which was trained to classify thyroid nodules. The model\u2019s performance was evaluated using the testing set and assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the confusion matrix. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy of the AI model was compared with that of radiologists to determine its clinical utility in ultrasound-based diagnosis.ResultsCompared to junior and senior radiologists, the AI model achieved near-perfect AUC values of 0.97 (BTN), 0.99 (NMTN), and 0.96 (MMTN), significantly outperforming the senior radiologist\u2019s AUCs (0.88 for NMTN) and the junior radiologist\u2019s weaker discrimination. In addition, the accuracy of this model was higher than all ultrasound radiologists (95% vs. 73 and 84% for the junior radiologist and senior radiologist, respectively).ConclusionThe AI-based ultrasound imaging diagnostic model showed excellent performance in differentiating BTN, NMTN, and MMTN, supporting its value as a diagnostic tool for the clinical decision-making process.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe nervous system governs fundamental life activities and higher neural functions, maintaining the body\u2019s interaction with the external environment and internal homeostasis. Neurological diseases are a common and complex group of disorders that severely impair patients\u2019 quality of life and physical health. Flavonoids, as a class of active components widely present in natural plants, play a crucial role in the research on neurological diseases.ObjectiveThe purpose of this review is to systematically sum up the action mechanisms, research advancements, and existing clinical uses of flavonoids in preventing and treating neurological diseases, probing into their potential in the management of neurological diseases.MethodsBy searching databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Wiley, Springer, NPG, ACS, Elsevier, and RSC, literature published between 2000 and 2025 concerning the treatment of neurological diseases with flavonoids was collected from both domestic and international sources. Priority should be given to flavonoids that have been confirmed by existing studies to be directly related to the pathogenesis or intervention effect of neurological diseases, with high quality and no contradictory results, clear chemical structures and definite metabolic pathways in vivo. Flavonoids that have no clear neurological association, have only been reported once and lack repeated verification or have a low level of evidence, and whose structures have not been resolved or whose metabolic processes are ambiguous should be excluded. After excluding studies with duplicate components and mechanisms, as well as outdated ones, a total of 190 core studies were finally screened and included from more than 15,000 literatures. These were systematically organized, categorized, and analysed across five dimensions: types of flavonoids, disease categories, experimental models, regulatory effects, and key targets.ResultsFlavonoids can exert neuroprotective effects in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases through multiple pathways, such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, anti-apoptosis, and neurotransmitter regulation.ConclusionFlavonoids exhibit clear pharmacological effects and favorable safety profiles in the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases, laying a foundation for the research and development of new drugs.",

      "content": "The proliferation of deepfake technologies presents serious challenges for forensic speech authentication. We propose a deep learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve detection of manipulated audio. Leveraging the spectral feature extraction of CNNs and the temporal modeling of LSTMs, the model demonstrates superior accuracy and generalization across the ASVspoof2019 LA and WaveFake datasets. Linear Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (LFCCs) were employed as acoustic features and outperformed MFCC and GFCC representations. To enhance transparency and trustworthiness, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including Grad-CAM and SHAP, were applied, revealing that the model focuses on high-frequency artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These interpretable analyses validate both the models design and the forensic relevance of LFCC features. The proposed approach thus provides a robust, interpretable, and XAI-driven solution for forensic authentic detection.",

      "title": "Emotional Contagion in Code: How GitHub Emoji Reactions Shape Developer Collaboration",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02515v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate, but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across 50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We identified five distinct patterns, with \"instant enthusiasm\" affecting 45.6% of items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping collaborative outcomes in software development.",

      "title": "HAGI++: Head-Assisted Gaze Imputation and Generation",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02468v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D, and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations. Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based analysis and interaction across various application domains.",

We present the architecture and design of OpenCourier, an open protocol that defines communication patterns within a decentralized ecosystem of delivery platforms. Through this protocol, we aim to address three key challenges in the current economy: power imbalances between the platform and workers, information asymmetries caused by black-boxed algorithms and value misalignments in the infrastructure design process. With the OpenCourier protocol, we outline a blueprint for community-owned ecosystem of delivery platforms that centers worker agency, transparency, and bottom-up design.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02428v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adherence to healthy diets reduces chronic illness risk, yet rates remain low. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for health communication but often struggle to engage individuals with ambivalent intentions at a pivotal stage of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). We developed CounselLLM, an open-source model enhanced through persona design and few-shot, domain-specific prompts grounded in TTM and Motivational Interviewing (MI). In controlled evaluations, CounselLLM showed stronger use of TTM subprocesses and MI affirmations than human counselors, with comparable linguistic robustness but expressed in more concrete terms. A user study then tested CounselLLM in an interactive counseling setting against a baseline system. While knowledge and perceptions did not change, participants' intentions for immediate dietary change increased significantly after interacting with CounselLLM. Participants also rated it as easy to use, understandable, and supportive. These findings suggest theory-driven LLMs can effectively engage ambivalent individuals and provide a scalable approach to digital counseling.",

The agent fuses (i) a semantically segmented 3-D environment, (ii) live application metadata, and (iii) users' verbal, pointing, and head-gaze cues to issue JSON window-placement actions. As a result, users can manage a panoramic workspace through: (1) explicit commands (\"Place Google Maps on the coffee table\"), (2) deictic speech plus gestures (\"Put that there\"), or (3) high-level goals (\"I need to send a message\"). Unlike traditional explicit interfaces, our system supports one-to-many action mappings and goal-centric reasoning, allowing the LLM to dynamically infer relevant applications and layout decisions, including interrelationships across tools. This enables seamless, intent-driven interaction without manual window juggling in immersive XR environments.",
