      "title": "A deformable attractor manifold organizes human resting-state brain dynamics",
      "content": "Intrinsic brain activity is often described as wandering within a continuous multivariate space, yet the organizing principles that constrain these dynamics remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous human brain activity during rest is structured by a deformable attractor manifold. Using large-scale fMRI datasets and a latent dynamical model, we find that cortical activity occupies two reproducible regimes: a low-coherence state with a unimodal latent distribution and a high-coherence state that exhibits bimodality, consistent with transient bistability across association networks. A compact two-parameter energy landscape explains these dynamics, revealing that transitions arise not from switching between discrete states, but from continuous deformation of the manifold that reshapes attractor geometry. Excursions into the bistable regime occur as rapid \"jumps\", whereas returns follow slow drifts along the manifold, reflecting network-specific timescales. Individuals with greater expression of the bistable regime show higher cognitive fluidity, and manifold parameters differentiate mild cognitive impairment from matched controls. These findings identify an organizing geometric and dynamical principle of resting activity, linking large-scale cortical coordination, cognitive variability, and vulnerability to pathology.",

      "title": "DNM2-CMT neuropathy stems from disrupted Schwann cell function and shows limited therapeutic reversibility",
      "content": "Dominant loss-of-function mutations in DNM2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy characterized by sensory and motor deficits associated with myelin and/or axonal abnormalities and muscle atrophy. Increasing DNM2 activity from embryogenesis has been reported to ameliorate neuromuscular phenotypes in the Dnm2K562E/+ CMT mouse; however, this model displays predominantly muscle pathology and limited nerve involvement, precluding rigorous evaluation of neuropathic mechanisms and potential therapies. Here, we performed comprehensive behavioral, electrophysiological, histological and molecular analyses to characterize the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse, which combines systemic heterozygosity for the common K562E mutation together with Schwann cell (SC)-specific deletion of wild-type Dnm2. This model faithfully reproduces key clinical and pathological features of DNM2-CMT, including motor deficits, reduced general force and coordination, and severe sensory and motor conduction deficits associated with axonal loss, demyelination, and inflammation. Mechanistically, we delineate a coherent pathological sequence that explains the profound functional deficits. In particular, a downregulation of the transcription factor EGR2, a master regulator of myelin gene expression, and of the myelin protein MPZ correlates with demyelination. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of DNM2 supplementation, post-symptomatic intrathecal delivery of AAV9-DNM2 driven by the Schwann cell-specific MPZ promoter was performed at 4 weeks. Although DNM2 expression increased in peripheral nerves (~1.9-fold), no significant improvements were observed across behavioural, electrophysiological, structural, or molecular parameters. Together, these findings establish the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse as a robust preclinical model, recapitulating key features of DNM2-CMT, and provides crucial insight into the biological and temporal constraints that must guide future therapeutic strategies for DNM2-CMT.",

      "title": "Astrocyte senescence impairs synaptogenesis due to Thrombospondin-1 loss.",
      "content": "Cellular senescence is an irreversible state linked to aging that involves molecular and functional alterations. The mammalian hippocampus, a key brain region for learning and memory, is highly vulnerable to damage in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, yet the role of cellular senescence in hippocampal aging remains underexplored. Here, we report an early onset of senescence signatures in hippocampal astrocytes of the accelerated aging and frailty mouse model SAMP8. We examine how astrocyte senescence affects excitatory synapse formation, focusing on soluble signals released by astrocytes. Astrocytes isolated from SAMP8 brain and those differentiated from SAMP8 neural stem cells show senescence hallmarks (SA-{beta}-gal, p16INK4a, Lamin B1 loss), alongside a significant reduction in synaptogenic function. While astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from control mice promotes excitatory synaptogenesis through thrombospondin-1 / 2{delta}-1 neuronal receptor signalling, ACM from senescent SAMP8 astrocytes lacks this capacity. Supplementing senescent ACM with thrombospondin-1 protein, or overexpressing thrombospondin-1 gene in senescent astrocytes, reinstates synaptogenesis. At the hippocampal level, thrombospondin-1 and synaptic puncta are reduced in SAMP8 mice. Our findings reveal that senescent astrocytes exhibit reduced synaptogenic capacity due to thrombospondin-1 loss, highlighting their contribution to synaptic dysfunction during aging. Preventing senescence in hippocampal astrocytes may thus restore astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis in the aged brain.",

      "title": "Selective impairment of spatial recognition memory and reduced frontal corticothalamic spine density following adolescent alcohol consumption",
      "content": "Heavy alcohol use is common during adolescence and is associated with increased risk of alcohol use disorder and prevalence of residual cognitive deficits, especially in behaviors associated with the latently developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). A major need for advancing our understanding of this relationship is replicable and accessible preclinical behavioral batteries that can be used to disassociate the effects of adolescent alcohol on select PFC circuits. Electrophysiological evidence implicates projections from the PFC to mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MdT) as being uniquely impacted by adolescent intermittent alcohol consumption in mice. The present study aims to evaluate if voluntary consumption of alcohol during adolescence impacts anxiety or PFC-associated spatial and recognition memory and if they are associated with morphological changes to the PFC-MdT circuit. Our results indicate that compared to water-only controls, male and female mice that voluntarily consumed alcohol during adolescence demonstrate performance deficits in the object-in-place recognition task, without affecting the novel object recognition task, Y-maze alternation, anxiety or locomotion, an outcome consistent with PFC and MdT dysfunction. Morphological assessment of PFC neurons from male and female mice following behavioral tasks found a reduction in spine density in basal and apical, but not oblique dendrites of PFC-MdT neurons. Collectively, these results implicate the PFC to MdT circuit integrity as a potential locus of the effects of adolescent alcohol on spatial recognition memory.",

      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Depletion of CD169+ border-associated macrophages induces Parkinson\u2019s disease-like behavior",
      "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) present with complex behavioral symptoms that can arise in the absence of overt structural brain damage. Recent evidence suggests that border-associated macrophages (BAMs) located at the brain\u2019s interfaces regulate central nervous system function, yet the specific roles of distinct BAM subsets remain largely undefined. By reanalyzing single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem PD brains, we identified a BAM subset expressing CD169 that was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls. To examine their function, we employed CD169-DTR mice to selectively ablate CD169+ BAMs and evaluated behavioral and histological changes. Depletion of CD169+ BAMs induced tremors, abnormal hindlimb reflexes, and heightened anxiety-like behavior without dopaminergic neuron loss. Histological analysis revealed a pronounced reduction of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, indicating disruption of olfactory-limbic circuitry. These findings demonstrate that CD169+ BAMs are critical for maintaining neural network stability and motor function, and that their loss can elicit PD-like phenotypes in the absence of classical dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This work establishes a novel mouse model linking brain-border immune cell dysfunction to Parkinsonian pathology and highlights a neuroimmune mechanism that may contribute to the onset of PD-like disorders.",
