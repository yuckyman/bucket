      "title": "Phase similarity between similar objects indicates representational merging across retrieval training but not sleep",
      "content": "Retrieval training (i.e., cued recall) is theorised to induce rapid memory consolidation, similarly to sleep. Across consolidation, related neural representations become increasingly similar; yet, this representational change has never been directly compared between sleep and retrieval training. In this study, 30 subjects (27F, 18-34, M=22.17) completed four separate sessions in which they (1) learnt object-word pairs, followed by (2) immediate recognition testing, (3) one of four 120-min interventions (retrieval training, restudy, sleep, or wake), and (4) delayed recognition testing. We compared EEG phase similarity between similar and different objects to assess the time, frequency, and anatomical distribution of representational similarity across encoding (learning to immediate recognition), and each intervention (immediate to delayed recognition). We hypothesised that EEG phase patterns for similar objects would become more similar (i.e., representational merging) across retrieval training and sleep interventions, and predict a greater endorsement of similar-object lures. Indeed, we found increased representational similarity between similar objects across the encoding shift in the theta-band and occipital sources. Crucially, additional representational merging was only observed across the retrieval training intervention, in the alpha-band and parieto-occipital sources. Despite retrieval training leading to reduced performance in discriminating similar-objects lures, greater representational merging across retrieval training predicted greater discrimination of similar-object lures. Together, these findings suggest that sleep and retrieval training induce different memory transformations across the same timescale. Retrieval training may generally provoke rapid gist extraction, with greater neocortical integration supporting episodic discrimination. Conversely, sleep may selectively maintain task-relevant episodic and semantic details in the short-term.",

      "title": "Sleep dynamics and epileptogenesis following Kainic acid in epilepsy-susceptible (DBA/2J) and epilepsy-resistant (C57BL/6) mice",
      "content": "Susceptibility to epileptogenesis varies in humans and outbred mouse strains. We hypothesized that baseline sleep abnormalities increase susceptibility to epileptogenesis following Kainic acid (KA) and abnormal circadian rhythm or sleep homeostasis (SH) contribute to worse seizures in epilepsy-susceptible DBAs. Following EEG electrode implantation, C57 and DBA mice underwent repeated low-dose KA or saline treatment. Seizures, interictal spikes and sleep were examined over 8-weeks with continuous electroencephalography (EEG). Seizures were manually scored, and interictal spikes and sleep were analyzed using machine learning algorithms. Slow wave activity (SWA) was derived from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep following Fourier transform, and SH was measured by the decay of SWA during sleep and its rise with preceding wakefulness. The impact of post-KA seizures on circadian rhythm was determined using Cosinor analysis. Seizures were longer and more frequent in KA-treated DBAs than C57s. Interictal spike were much greater in saline-treated DBAs than C57s. SWA across the 24-hours was lower in DBAs at baseline. KA treatment decreased REM and increased SWA activity in DBAs but not in C57s. Cosinor analysis revealed circadian rhythm abnormalities in DBAs but not in C57s. Seizures impaired SH in DBAs, with no increase in SWA with preceding wakefulness and a progressive loss of SWA decay during lights-on over the 8-week recording. These findings suggest that baseline sleep abnormalities, poorly adaptable circadian rhythms and impaired SH are associated with increased vulnerability to epileptogenesis. Therapies enhancing circadian rhythm and SH after an insult may be avenues to mitigate epileptogenesis in vulnerable populations.",

      "content": "Fiber photometry measures neural activity in vivo from genetically encoded indicators. Recordings generate large datasets that require extensive preprocessing and robust statistical methods for meaningful interpretation. However, existing analysis tools demand programming expertise, limiting accessibility. Here we describe FPmotion, a comprehensive, user-friendly software platform for batchwise processing, integration, and statistical analysis of fiber photometry data with or without accompanying behavioral information. FPmotion performs filtering, isosbestic regression, dF/F computation, detrending, and z-scoring. It also extracts detailed peak properties at whole-file, block-level, and individual-peak resolution. When behavioral data is provided, FPmotion automatically identifies behavioral bouts, computes bout-level statistics, performs peri-event signal extraction, and supports multi-group comparisons through ANOVA- and LMEM-based statistical frameworks. All analyses generate publication-ready figures and structured CSV outputs suitable for downstream workflows. FPmotion also introduces a dedicated alignment module for peri-event signal analysis. This module applies dynamic time warping followed by barycenter averaging to realign peri-event traces while preserving the behavioral time anchor, producing cleaner and more temporally coherent peri-event motifs. We demonstrate the capabilities of FPmotion software using the dlight1.1 sensor to measure dopamine responses from ventral striatum in behaving mice before and after amphetamine treatment. Together, FPmotion offers a fully automated framework for FP data analysis that improves interpretability and accessibility while reducing analysis time substantially.",

      "title": "Persistent impairment of spatial hearing and neural binaural interaction after temporary noise-induced hearing loss",
      "content": "Many people have trouble understanding speech in noisy environments despite normal audiometric thresholds, a condition referred to as hidden hearing loss. A leading hypothesis attributes this deficit to inner hair cell synaptic pathology (cochlear synaptopathy), which can persist after recovery from noise-induced temporary elevation of audiometric thresholds. This pathology impairs the temporally precise sound encoding necessary for spatial hearing, but direct evidence in primates, human or nonhuman, is lacking. Here, we show that a single noise exposure, producing only a temporary threshold elevation, induced long-lasting alterations in synaptic morphology, without synapse loss, resulting in persistent spatial hearing deficits for up to 11 months post-exposure in nonhuman primates of both sexes. These perceptual deficits were accompanied by a reduction in a neurophysiological measure of binaural processing - the binaural interaction component (BIC) of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Both behavioral and neural deficits persisted despite full recovery of audiometric thresholds. Together, these findings provide the first evidence in primates that noise exposure disrupts spatial hearing and binaural neural circuit function without loss of hair cells or synapses. Because spatial hearing tests and the ABR/BIC are clinically accessible, this work also establishes translational biomarkers for early neural dysfunction underlying hidden hearing loss.",

      "title": "Multiple-Context Training Enhances Generalization of Cued Fear Extinction and Requires the Dorsal Hippocampus",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Multiple-session fear extinction (FE) models exposure therapy, which also occurs over many sessions. In humans, conducting extinction training across multiple contexts improves fear suppression as compared to a single context, but rodent work delineating boundary conditions and neural mechanisms remains sparse. METHODS: We compared single-context FE (SCFE) versus multiple-context FE (MCFE) in 129S1 and C57BL/6J mice, manipulating context familiarity (familiar vs novel FE contexts). Outcomes included FE acquisition and tests for fear relapse such as recent (2 d) and remote (30 d) recall in trained, extinction, and novel contexts, as well as reinstatement tests. We mapped extinction-related neural activity with dual Fos labeling (TRAPxFos immunofluorescence) and graph analyses of regional co-activation, and used chemogenetic inhibition to selectively silence dorsal (dHP) or ventral hippocampus (vHP) during extinction. RESULTS: MCFE produced greater across-session reduction in freezing than SCFE. The MCFE advantage did not require contextual novelty. MCFE also enhanced short- (2 d) and long-term (30 d) recall in a novel context, but did not prevent recovery over time or US-induced reinstatement. Dual-labeling revealed that MCFE strengthened hippocampal-prefrontal co-activation (with relatively weaker prefrontal-amygdala coupling than SCFE). Chemogenetic silencing of dHP, but not vHP, selectively impaired between-session extinction under MCFE and abolished the MCFE benefit; hippocampal silencing did not improve SCFE. CONCLUSIONS: Conducting extinction across multiple contexts enhances acquisition and recall relative to SCFE, without requiring novelty, and engages distinct hippocampal-prefrontal circuit dynamics. dHP activity is necessary for the MCFE-specific improvement, highlighting a circuit mechanism in which distributing extinction across contexts augments fear reduction.",

      "title": "Cortical plasticity of the tactile mirror system in borderline personality disorder",
      "content": "Individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) show alterations in empathic abilities, potentially involving automatic simulation processes supported by mirror-like mechanisms in the somatosensory domain. Within the tactile mirror system (TaMS), observing touch on another person's body activates cortical regions involved in tactile perception, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Although mirror-like alterations have been suggested in BPD, the underlying mechanisms of plasticity remain underexplored. Here, we used a cross-modal paired associative stimulation (cm-PAS) protocol to investigate the plasticity mechanisms of TaMS functioning in BPD. Twenty-four individuals with BPD and 24 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Empathic abilities were assessed using self-report questionnaires. Participants performed tactile acuity and visuo-tactile spatial congruity (VTSC) tasks before and after a cm-PAS protocol. During cm-PAS, images of a hand being touched were paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the S1. The effects of cm-PAS were assessed on tactile acuity, as an index of S1 activity, and VTSC performance, as an index of TaMS functioning. Preregistered analyses revealed that patients with BPD tended to have lower cognitive empathy than HCs, with no significant cm-PAS effects on tactile acuity or VTSC performance in HCs, precluding between-group comparisons of plasticity effects. Exploratory analyses indicated notable interindividual variability. In HCs, baseline performance predicted cm-PAS-induced changes, and higher cognitive empathy was associated with stronger VTSC interference; this pattern was inconsistent in patients with BPD despite comparable baseline measures. These findings highlight substantial interindividual variability in cm-PAS effects and a disrupted relationship between cognitive empathy and TaMS functioning in BPD.",

      "title": "m6A modification and prion-like domain proteins converge to dysregulate Neuronal RNA Granules in Alzheimer s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a deadly neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. It is associated with several dysregulated pathways, including axonal transport. The latter supplies synapses with several essential components, including proteins and mRNAs. A proportion of RNAs in neurons is transported from the soma to neuronal extensions along microtubules in highly organized structures, known as Neuronal RNA Granules (NRGs). NRGs have a heterogeneous composition of coding and non-coding RNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and components of translational machinery. In this study, we investigate the potential involvement of NRGs in AD pathogenesis, with a particular focus on the N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a key RNA modification, and prion-like domain (PrLD) proteins. Our in-silico analysis revealed that a significant portion of mRNAs in NRGs are likely to be highly methylated. Using transcriptomic data from AD brain, we identify dysregulation of key genes in the m6A-methylation pathway (METTL3, FTO, YTHDF2/3, eIF3m) as well as PrLD-containing proteins associated with NRGs (STAU2, YBX1). We further observe aberrant expression of m6A-methylated mRNAs within both NRGs and synapses. Gene Ontology analysis highlights disruptions in pathways related to NRGs and synaptic function. Together, our findings suggest that impaired NRGs homeostasis may represent a critical and previously underappreciated contributor to AD pathogenesis. By outlining the potential roles of m6A and PrLD proteins in regulating NRGs, this work offers a new conceptual framework to better understand AD and identify NRGs as a potential therapeutic target. Finally, we propose a working model illustrating how dysregulation of NRGs homeostasis may drive neurodegeneration in AD.",

      "title": "Long-term Effects of Early Life Adversity On Brain Dopamine and Serotonin Receptor Systems Involved In Cocaine Reinforcement In Adult Macaques: a Positron Emission Tomography study",
      "content": "Early life adverse (ELA) experiences such as child maltreatment (MALT) are associated with physical and mental illness, including substance use disorders (SUDs), but underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study examined long-term effects of infant MALT on adult brain serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in reward and emotional control, using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, a translational infant MALT macaque model of cocaine use disorder (CUD) risk and a COC self-administration (SA) paradigm. The study focused on regional serotonin 5HT1A, 5HT2A, and dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability (BP) differences between MALT and Control animals using PET, both at baseline (pre-COC SA) and following chronic COC SA (once they reached a total of 100 mgCOC/kg bodyweight intake). We also examined whether levels of these neurochemical receptors predicted COC SA measures, including reinforcing properties and potency using fixed-ratio (FR) peak response rates (RR) and progressive-ratio (PR) peak breakpoint. Our findings showed long-term effects of infant MALT on 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic circuits. Specifically, MALT animals showed lower 5HT1A BP in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus compared to Controls. A MALT by Sex interaction effect was detected in 5HT2A BP in the OFC, with lower levels in MALT than Control males, but not in females. In addition, upregulation of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors was detected following chronic COC SA in most PFC subregions, hippocampus, and NAcc, particularly in the Control group. These findings suggest long-term effects of ELA on adult 5HT, but not DA, receptors in corticolimbic regions involved in emotional and reward processes. We also found associations between PET baseline (pre-COC SA) receptor BP data and COC SA measures; in particular, a positive correlation between 5HT1A receptor BP in caudate and FR Response Rates, whereas amygdala 5HT1A receptor levels were positively correlated with PR peak breakpoint and negatively correlated with and FR Response Rates. Overall, these findings suggest an important role of 5HT1A and 5HT2A PFC receptors in early COC-related changes in reward circuitry and of amygdala 5HT receptors on reward motivated behaviors. The dynamic change of these 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptors following chronic COC exposure was blunted in animals with ELA. It would be important to understand the biological consequences of the dynamic changes in these 5HT receptors and whether they predict risk for COC relapse and can inform future pharmacological interventions that target 5HT receptors for treatment of CUD.",

      "title": "Multilayer Network Modelling of the Human Reading System",
      "content": "Reading is supported by rapid and flexible coordination of neural activity across distributed brain regions. We have previously shown that left fusiform gyrus (FusG) provides a bridge flexibly linking the visual form analysis required for reading with the language system. Here, we investigate the dynamic organisation of an extending reading network encompassing classical perisylvian language areas and FusG. We do so by applying multilayer network modelling to language fMRI data acquired through the Australian Epilepsy Project, using a paradigm that contrasts reading with visuospatial judgements. The dataset included 201 participants with left dominant language, both with and without seizure disorders. We hypothesised that the relative strength of dynamic interactions within this extended language network is associated with reading ability. Time resolved functional connectivity was estimated using a sliding window Pearson's correlation approach, and the resulting connectivity matrices were entered into a multilayer community detection algorithm to quantify spatiotemporal community structure within the reading network. We concentrate our analyses on allegiance, the probability that a pair of regions is assigned to the same community over time. Our results show that community structure within the reading network is characterised by a preference for within hemisphere assignment over cross hemisphere assignment, as well as higher nodal allegiance among left language regions compared with their right hemisphere homologues. As anticipated, within versus between network allegiance followed a similar gradient in both language and attention networks: lowest between left language and right attentional regions, intermediate between the left FusG and each respective network, and highest within-network (left language or right attention). Importantly, as hypothesised, reading ability was associated with FusG-inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) interactions: higher left FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with better reading performance, whereas increased right FusG-left IFG allegiance correlated with poorer reading. These findings highlight hemispheric asymmetries in the dynamic organisation of the reading system and provide novel evidence linking individual differences in reading ability to network level dynamics. Our findings align with a developmental literature suggesting that as reading proficiency improves, there is a shift from bilateral to unilateral left occipitotemporal engagement.",

      "title": "Latent biophysical diffusion properties underlying cerebral microstructure revealed through multimodal MRI covariation in the squirrel monkey",
      "content": "Diffusion MRI provides multiple quantitative descriptors of neural tissue derived from distinct physical and biophysical models, each probing different aspects of cerebral microstructure. While these metrics are often interpreted independently, their joint statistical structure may encode information about latent biophysical properties that constrain and organize brain microarchitecture. Here, we investigate whether stable patterns of multimodal diffusion MRI covariation reveal underlying biophysical diffusion properties of cerebral microstructure in the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). Using a high-resolution multimodal diffusion MRI dataset acquired at 11.7T (400 m isotropic resolution) from 15 adult subjects, we analyzed tensor-based metrics alongside advanced multicompartment and axonal models, including NODDI and ActiveAx. Voxelwise and region-level correlation analyses were performed across multiple spatial scales to examine the structure, redundancy, and stability of relationships among diffusion-derived maps. We show that metrics originating from conceptually distinct models consistently organize into a low-dimensional structure characterized by stable clusters of covariation, robust to changes in parcellation and spatial aggregation. These patterns cannot be explained by trivial metric redundancy alone, but instead suggest convergence toward a reduced set of effective biophysical degrees of freedom governing diffusion behavior in neural tissue, including axonal organization, neurite density, orientation dispersion, and isotropic diffusion components. We interpret these covariation structures as manifestations of latent biophysical diffusion properties, emergent tissue states that are not directly observable through any single metric but become apparent through their structured relationships. From a systems neuroscience perspective, the stability of these latent dimensions supports the view that adult cerebral microstructure reflects the steady-state outcome of neurodevelopmental dynamics operating under biophysical constraints. Rather than providing a regional atlas, this work proposes a conceptual framework for interpreting multimodal diffusion MRI as a projection of an underlying low-dimensional biophysical state space organizing cerebral microstructure in primate brains.",

      "title": "Dopamine signatures of excessive and compulsive cocaine and fentanyl use",
      "content": "Excessive and compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences is a hallmark of substance use disorder, yet individuals differ markedly in their vulnerability to develop these behaviors. Drugs of abuse are long known to alter endogenous dopamine (DA) signaling, but shared principles for how DA dynamics impact compulsive use among individuals and across drug classes are lacking. Here, we monitored DA release in the medial shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) during cocaine and fentanyl self-administration, with or without coincident punishment, in large cohorts of mice. Contingent cocaine and fentanyl self-administration evoked complex and individually distinct DA dynamics; nevertheless, a robust negative correlation held across both drugs, such that high takers exhibited lower drug-evoked DA signals. During punished drug taking, cocaine and fentanyl cases were associated with distinct DA signatures of compulsivity. For cocaine, punishment-resistant mice showed lower sustained DA responses during the post-shock, drug-associated cue period, whereas for fentanyl, punishment-resistant mice displayed larger phasic DA at the co-occurrence of footshock and drug infusion. To identify common principles underlying these observations, we developed a computational model grounded in an Actor-Critic temporal-difference (TD) learning framework that incorporates internal states, agent's uncertainty, and drug-specific effects. Remarkably, this model captures the observed diversity in DA dynamics across drug classes and among mice with variable drug taking propensities, hereby providing a unified interpretation of NAc DA signals as encoding TD reward prediction errors.",
