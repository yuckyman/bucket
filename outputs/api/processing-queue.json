      "title": "Emergence of focal cortical hyperexcitability in the murine tetanus toxin epilepsy model",
      "content": "Focal epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders that may be caused by a large variety of underlying brain lesions. Long-term quality of life prognosis is often poor, and treatment options are limited. Despite significant progress in animal model sophistication over the past decades, a deeper understanding of epileptogenic processes on a mesoscale and microscale circuit level is needed. Here we model focal epileptogenesis in mice using single intracortical tetanus toxin injections and employ chronic in vivo two-photon and widefield calcium imaging with simultaneous EEG and behavioral video recordings (\"multimodal\" recordings) to follow epileptogenic changes over time. We observe a moderate increase in global brain excitability on EEG but, more strikingly, a gradual emergence of brief but intense optically recorded epileptiform events (\"microseizures\") that are spatially limited, peaking around 20-30 days after toxin injection and waning over the next 30 days. During these events, a majority of local neurons are recruited into extreme depolarization, yet there is considerable variability in duration and spatial coverage between events, depending on the proximity to the injection focus and the number of days elapsed since injection. Notably, EEG electrodes <3 mm from the focus typically fail to detect these events, highlighting the utility of high-resolution in vivo optical imaging for capturing all events in focal epileptogenesis. Single-cell patch clamp recordings in awake animals confirm that microseizure episodes are associated with depolarization block, during which the calcium signal remains high. Using chronic multimodal recordings, we detect an initial rise of interictal activity in local cortical networks during the first day after injection, followed by a layer-specific suppression and dysregulation of interictal spontaneous network activity in local cortical circuits preceding microseizure events, and low-level suppression when microseizures started subsiding. The chronic suppression in interictal activity is accompanied by relative hypoactivity of PV+ interneurons and concurrent hyperactivity of SOM+ interneurons. This integrated imaging-electrophysiology approach provides a powerful platform for unraveling circuit-level mechanisms of focal epilepsy and potentially for identifying and testing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.",

      "content": "The center surround structure of ganglion cells receptive fields is suited for edge detection, a first step towards image segmentation. However, in a dynamical visual scene with moving objects, it is less clear how the retina represents the boundaries of moving objects and therefore contributes to motion segmentation. Here, we show that the spatial selectivity of ganglion cells changes during their responses to a moving object. Specific cell types only respond to contrast changes near the edges of the moving object. Using a non-linear model to reproduce this result, we could isolate the mechanism responsible for this edge tracking behavior. Different types provide complementary representation of a moving object, some enhancing its boundaries, and may thus provide primitives for motion segmentation.",

      "title": "Membrane potential dynamics of peripheral cold-sensitive neurons in Drosophila larvae",
      "content": "Drosophila larvae sense diverse external stimuli through peripheral multidendritic (md) sensory neurons, among which Class III (CIII) neurons are essential for detecting noxious cold temperatures. Previous extracellular recordings showed that CIII neurons produce a characteristic phasic-tonic response to cold: a transient high-frequency spiking phase, during which about half of the neurons burst, followed by frequency adaptation. Here, we report the first intracellular recordings from CIII neurons, allowing us to characterize the membrane potential dynamics underlying their cold-evoked spiking responses. At rest, CIII neurons showed membrane potential fluctuations that occasionally triggered sporadic spikes. Cold stimulation induced a sustained depolarization that evoked a train of spikes, with spike rates peaking at 2-12 spikes/s within the first 5 s, followed by a gradual decline. About half of the neurons exhibited occasional bursts, in which clusters of 2-6 spikes at 10-120 Hz superimposed on a brief depolarizing hump. Cold stimulation also increased input resistance and amplified electrotonically spreading spikes, suggesting enhanced electrotonic signaling from distal sites via an increased space constant. Together, these findings provide key insights into the electrophysiological mechanisms of sensory encoding in peripheral neurons and establish a framework for dissecting the ionic and structural mechanisms of cold transduction.",

      "content": "Stress profoundly impacts systemic metabolism, yet the central circuits linking stress responses to peripheral metabolic regulation remain poorly defined. Here, we identify the preBotzinger complex (preBotC), a brainstem breathing rhythm generator, as a key stress-responsive hub coordinating metabolic adaptations. Using viral tracing, we show that preBotC neurons project to brown adipose tissue and liver, and that a subset of these projection neurons expresses the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor PAC1R, positioning PACAP signaling as a critical modulator of this circuit. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed robust preBotC activation under stress, while spatial transcriptomics demonstrated altered neuronal metabolic circuitry in preBotC following PAC1R ablation. PAC1R knockdown in preBotC combined with stress resulted in blunted respiratory rhythmicity, reduced sympathetic innervation, and suppression of energy expenditure and lipid metabolic pathways in brown fat, while reprogramming hepatic transcriptional networks toward amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. These findings define a unique neuropeptidergic brainstem periphery circuit integrating stress, respiration, and metabolism.",

      "title": "MyoGen: Unified Biophysical Modeling of Human Neuromotor Activity and Resulting Signals",
      "content": "Understanding human motor control requires integrating cortical and spinal cord activity, muscle mechanics, and electrophysiology, levels that are often studied separately. We present MyoGen, an open-source framework that unifies spinal circuitry, proprioceptive feedback, musculotendon dynamics, cortical activity, and multimodal electromyography (EMG) generation in a single, interoperable platform. Spinal motor neurons and the resulting motor unit (MU) action potentials represent the only neural cells that can be accessed at scale in humans. We used human MU ensembles to validate our model across a wide range of experimental conditions. Using data-driven optimization, we found that MyoGen produces MU population activity that closely matches experimental discharge-rate distributions and discharge variability across human muscles. Moreover, it generates decomposable surface and intramuscular EMG, reproduces beta-band modulation of descending drive and its nonlinear transformation into force, and implements complete sensorimotor loops. Dimensionality reduction of simulated agonist-antagonist EMG reveals low-dimensional control manifolds consistent with experimental recordings from both healthy and spinal cord injured individuals. MyoGen provides physiologically grounded, ground-truth data and integrates seamlessly with analysis pipelines, enabling systematic investigation of motor control principles, validation of signal-processing algorithms, and exploration of sensorimotor interactions that are experimentally inaccessible.",

      "content": "Perceptual decisions are shaped by expectations about sensory stimuli and rewards, learned through sensory and reward prediction errors. Dopamine is known to convey reward prediction errors that shape perceptual decisions. However, whether dopamine also signals sensory prediction errors during perceptual decision-making remains unknown. We recorded dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of mice performing a visual decision-making task while manipulating sensory and reward expectations. The two manipulations produced similar behavioral biases but elicited opposite dopamine signals, indicating that dopamine within the same striatal region encoded both sensory and reward prediction errors. Sensory prediction error signaling was specific to dopamine as striatal acetylcholine showed no such error signals. Optogenetically stimulating striatal dopamine at stimulus onset biased subsequent perceptual decisions, consistent with updating sensory expectations. A computational model learning from both sensory and reward prediction errors captured behavioral biases and dopamine data, revealing distinct but spatially overlapping dopaminergic teaching signals.",

      "title": "Versatile Learning without Synaptic Plasticity in a Spiking Neural Network",
      "content": "Learning in the brain's cerebral cortex is widely attributed to synaptic plasticity among cortical neurons. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that alternative processes, such as modulation of intrinsic excitability or gating by subcortical inputs, may also serve as important learning mechanisms. We developed the Bias Adaptive Neural Firing Framework (BANFF) as a simplified model of such phenomena embodied by a learnable bias current for each neuron of a rate-based network. Here, we extend this framework to spiking neural networks. We show that learning such biases enables one recurrent spiking neural network with fixed and random synaptic weights to perform well on nine tasks spanning classification, regression, and closed-loop dynamical systems mimicry. The network learnt a unique bias set for each task, and unlike recurrent synapse-based learning, new learning did not interfere with previous learning. The network was robust to non-stationary F-I curves (spike frequency adaptation), and biases could be learned with a learning algorithm (e-prop) that is more biologically plausible than stock gradient descent. Overall, we show that the BANFF can be extended from rate-based to spiking neural networks, maintaining good multi-task performance with a single network of spiking neurons.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

On top of that my country has a billion+ people and everything seems like battle for scraps.<p>Unless I hit home with some indie hacking/side project, I don't think this will be possible.
