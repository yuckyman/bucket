      "title": "The role of MICOS in modulating mitochondrial dynamics and structural changes in vulnerable regions of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) complexes are critical for maintaining the mitochrondrial architecture, cristae integrity, and organelle communication in neurons. MICOS disruption has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of MICOS-associated neuronal alterations during aging remain unclear. Using three-dimensional reconstructions of hypothalamic and cortical neurons, we observed age-dependent fragmentation of mitochondrial cristae, reduced intermitochondrial connectivity, and compartment-specific changes in mitochondrial size and morphology. Notably, these structural deficits were most pronounced in neurons vulnerable to AD-related pathology, suggesting a mechanistic link between MICOS disruption and the early mitochondrial dysfunction observed in patients with AD. Our findings indicate that the loss of MICOS integrity is a progressive feature of neuronal aging, contributing to impaired bioenergetics and reduced resilience to metabolic stress and potentially facilitating neurodegenerative processes. MICOS disruption reduced neuronal firing and synaptic responsiveness, with miclxin treatment decreasing mitochondrial connectivity and inducing cristae disorganization. These changes link MICOS structural deficits directly to impaired neuronal excitability, highlighting vulnerability to AD-related neurodegeneration. These results underscore the importance of MICOS as a critical determinant of neuronal mitochondrial health and as a potential target for interventions aimed at mitigating AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction.",

      "content": "IntroductionMotor imagery (MI) classification and sleep apnea (SA) detection are two critical tasks in brain-computer interface (BCI) and biomedical signal analysis. Traditional deep learning models have shown promise in these domains, but often struggle with temporal sparsity and energy efficiency, especially in real-time or embedded applications.MethodsIn this study, we propose SpiTranNet, a novel architecture that deeply integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformers through Spiking Multi-Head Attention (SMHA), where spiking neurons replace standard activation functions within the attention mechanism. This integration enables biologically plausible temporal processing and energy-efficient computations while maintaining global contextual modeling capabilities. The model is evaluated across three physiological datasets, including one electroencephalography (EEG) dataset for MI classification and two electrocardiography (ECG) datasets for SA detection.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the hybrid SNN-Transformer model achieves competitive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning and deep learning models.DiscussionThis work highlights the potential of neuromorphic-inspired architectures for robust and efficient biomedical signal processing across diverse physiological tasks.",

      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages pathways throughout the brain and is a significant global health concern, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where the incidence is high and long-term deficits are prevalent. This study explores the utility of central auditory processing (CAP) testing as a marker of previous TBI. Seventy individuals with a history of moderate to severe TBI (msTBI) were matched by age and sex to 46 healthy controls in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Participants underwent comprehensive behavioral CAP testing, including tests of speech-in-noise ability, temporal resolution, and dichotic listening. Multivariate logistic regression showed the Triple Digit Test (TDT) (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) significantly predicted msTBI status, independent of age and peripheral hearing ability. Elastic net modeling supported these findings, highlighting TDT performance as the most robust predictor of msTBI history. A history of msTBI is associated with poorer CAP performance, particularly on speech-in-noise tests. These tests could serve as accessible, resource-efficient tools for assessing brain function related to TBI in clinical and resource-limited settings. Studies in larger, more diverse populations are needed to explore their predictive utility for long-term cognitive outcomes after TBI.",

      "title": "Towards Video-LLM Driven Workflow for Behavioral Segmentation and Scoring in Mice Performing a Skilled Water Reaching Task: An Evaluation of Recent LLM Models",
      "content": "Significance: Behavior scoring is labor-intensive and subjective, introducing variability in results. Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of video understanding offer a transformative solution to manual scoring, crucial for accelerating and standardizing neuroscience workflows. Aim: We sought to benchmark state-of-the-art video LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen3-VL, and VideoLLaMA3) for automated behavioural segmentation and scoring of mice performing a water-reaching task. Approach: Videos of mice performing water reaching from the front view were analysed by the LLMs. Accuracy was compared across different models and against prompt adjustments within Gemini. To assess classification determinants, video fidelity was altered through pixel interpolation and key regions blurred (paws/snout-mouth). In addition, the models were asked to describe the mouse's actions over time. Results: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Mean: 0.74, SD: 0.12) and Qwen3-VL-30B (Mean: 0.67, SD: 0.13) exhibited ability to classify trial outcomes. Reliable classification required a minimum pixel resolution of 0.28 mm per pixel. Accuracy is significantly reduced upon obscuring the snout-mouth area. In 549/1058 of videos, Gemini 2.5 Pro also provided completely accurate frame-to- frame behaviour segmentations. Conclusions: Video-LLMs offer potential to accelerate neuroscience by providing scalable, objective quantification of goal-directed behaviors. By producing temporal annotations, Gemini enables fast first-pass labelling that markedly streamlines manual dataset curation.",

      "title": "MRS4Brain: a processing toolbox for preclinical MR spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging data",
      "content": "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique for probing metabolism and underpins advanced methods such as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion-weighted spectroscopy (DWS). MRSI enables spatial mapping of metabolite distributions, offering insights into regional metabolic heterogeneity that single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) cannot capture. However, MRSI produces large multidimensional datasets and requires complex processing pipelines, limiting reproducibility and accessibility. While human studies benefit from advanced processing tools, similar developments in preclinical research remain scarce, highlighting a demand for practical tools accessible to non-experts. To address this need, we introduce the MRS4Brain Toolbox, a freely available MATLAB-based platform for preclinical spectroscopy, including MRSI, SVS, and DWS. The toolbox integrates reconstruction, preprocessing, quantification, quality control, brain segmentation automatically overlaid on metabolite maps, modeling, and statistical analysis into unified workflows accessible via a graphical interface. By streamlining data processing and reducing technical barriers, MRS4Brain Toolbox promotes reproducibility, harmonization, and broader adoption of advanced spectroscopic techniques in preclinical studies, ultimately facilitating translational research.",
