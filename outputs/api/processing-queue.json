      "title": "Typedkafka - A typed Kafka wrapper to make my own life easier",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The last two years I have spent way too much time working with Kafka in Python. Mostly confluent-kafka, though I've also had the displeasure of encountering some stuff on kafka-python. Both have the same fundamental problem which is that you're basically coding blind.</p> <p>There are no type hints. There are barely any docstrings. Half the methods have signatures that just say <code>*args, **kwargs</code> and you're left wondering what the hell you're supposed to pass in. This means that you're doomed to read librdkafka C docs and try to map C parameter names back to whatever Python is expecting.</p> <p>So today, on my precious weekend, I got fed up enough to do something about it. I built a wrapper called <em>typedkafka</em> that sits on top of <em>confluent-kafka</em> and adds everything I wished it had from the start. Which frankly is just proper type hints and docstrings on every public method.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Wraps confluent-kafka with full type hints and docstrings so your IDE knows how to help you. It also adds a proper exception hierarchy, mock clients which enables unit tests of your Kafka code without spinning up a broker, and built-in support for transactions, async, retry, and serialization.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Anyone who's using confluent-kafka and has experienced the same frustrations as me.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p><em>types-confluent-kafka</em> is a type stubs package. It adds annotations so mypy stops complaining, but it doesn't give you docstrings, doesn't change the exceptions, and doesn't help with testing.</p> <p><em>faust / faust-streaming</em> is a stream processing framework. If you just want to produce and consume messages with a clean typed API, I'd argue that it's overkill. The difference here is that typedkafka is just trying to make basic Kafka interactions much easier.</p> <p><strong>Links</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Jgprog117/typedkafka\">GitHub</a><br /> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/typedkafka/\">Pypi</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/anoraxian\"> /u/anoraxian </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qsdsit/typedkafka_a_typed_kafka_wrapper_to_make_my_own/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qsdsit/typedkafka_a_typed_kafka_wrapper_to_make_my_own/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Feasibility of PIANO-Cog for older adults: A randomised controlled pilot trial exploring changes in cognition and brain microstructure.",
      "content": "Background: Executive functions are a key target of cognitive interventions for older adults due to their central role in daily functioning and maintaining a good quality of life. Piano training has been proposed as an ecologically valid method of improving cognition and brain structure in older adults. The primary aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Piano Instruction for Adult Novices as an Online Cognitive Intervention (PIANO-Cog), a novel bespoke 8-week self-guided piano training programme for adults over 50 years of age, and (ii) assess the feasibility of conducting a fully-powered randomised controlled trial (RCT), including recruitment, retention, and adherence. Secondary aims explored effects of PIANO-Cog on executive functions and brain microstructure using advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Method: Thirty-three healthy music novices aged 51-80 years (M = 63.73, SD = 7.94) participated in a two-arm unblinded feasibility RCT. Participants were assigned by stratified allocation for age and sex to either (i) 8 weeks of PIANO-Cog, requiring 30 minutes of practice, 5 days per week, or (ii) a passive control group. Cognitive assessment and MRI scanning were conducted before and after the intervention using a strong-gradient (300mT/m) 3T Connectom scanner to acquire multi-shell DWI data with b-values ranging from 200 to 6,000 s/mm2. Grey and white matter microstructure were modelled with Soma And Neurite Density Imaging (SANDI) and Neurite Orientation Density and Dispersion Imaging (NODDI). Results: According to predefined criteria, feasibility was established for recruitment (91.6%), retention (75%) and adherence (>100%) rates. Preliminary observations suggest that piano training compared with control was associated with improvements in verbal fluency and multiple changes in brain microstructure including increases in apparent soma size and radius and reductions in extracellular signal in frontal and temporal cortical regions, larger apparent neurite density in right inferior frontal gyrus and changes in neurite dispersion in left middle temporal and right precentral gyri. Discussion: The results demonstrate that short-term remote piano training is a feasible cognitive intervention for healthy adults over 50. Preliminary evidence suggest that PIANO-Cog was associated cognitive improvements and changes in brain microstructure in executive, auditory and motor regions.",

      "title": "Electroencephalography signatures of motor error and stimulus-driven attention in electrical muscle stimulation-induced wrist movements under motor imagery",
      "content": "This study examines how electroencephalography (EEG) signatures are modulated during passive movements induced by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). Specifically, we focused on three key factors: (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions (motor imagery and waiting). We tested how error-related neural responses are modulated by the mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs during motor imagery. To this end, we introduced a wrist-movement paradigm combining motor imagery with EMS. Participants either imagined wrist dorsiflexion toward visual targets or passively waited. EMS was then applied to induce passive wrist movements. EMS intensity and presentation rate were manipulated so that the magnitude of stepwise motor error (physical deviation from the target) and stimulation-driven attention varied inversely, allowing us to evaluate their respective neural effects. Event-related potential (ERP) components at approximately 700 ms reflected graded evaluation of motor error. An ERP component at approximately 300 ms was modulated primarily by EMS intensity and presentation rate, consistent with stimulus-driven attention. Mu-band suppression reflected the match between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Theta-band enhancement in the absence of motor imagery suggested increased sensory unpredictability due to the lack of internally generated predictions, whereas beta-band activity may have been related to fluctuations in state prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed motor imagery with the EMS wrist-movement paradigm is the first to investigate how (1) motor errors, (2) stimulus-driven attention, and (3) cognitive conditions shape EEG signatures during passive, electrically induced movements. Understanding how these neural signals vary with mismatch between predictions and actual sensory inputs offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of error processing and sensory prediction in the human brain.",
