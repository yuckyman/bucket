I decided to just build a game that I used to love and added some bells and whistles.</p> <p>It's a terminal-based basketball sim where you actually control the plays - like those old 80s computer lab games but with real NBA teams and stats. Pick the '96 Bulls, face off against the '17 Warriors, and YOU decide whether MJ passes to Pippen or takes the shot.</p> <p>I spent way too much time on this, but it's actually pretty fun:</p> <p>- 23 championship teams from different eras (Bill Russell's Celtics to last year's Celtics) </p> <p>- You control every possession - pass, shoot, make subs</p> <p>- Built in some era-balancing so the '72 Lakers don't get completely destroyed by modern spacing</p> <p>- Used the Rich library for the UI (first time using it, pretty cool)</p> <p>The whole thing runs in your terminal. Single keypress controls, no waiting around.</p> <p>Not gonna lie, I've dabbled with Python mostly on the data science/analytics side but I consider this my first real project and I'm kinda nervous putting it out there.

      "title": "GABA co-release guides the functional maturation of glycinergicsynapses in an auditory sound localization circuit.",
      "content": "In the mammalian brainstem and spinal cord, glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.",

      "title": "Top-down control of sustained attention by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)- locus coeruleus (LC) circuit during the rodent continuous performance task (rCPT)",
      "content": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in attention by exerting top-down control to allocate cognitive resources toward behaviorally relevant stimuli based on learned context and expectations. mPFC neurons project to multiple cortical and subcortical regions, including the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's primary source of norepinephrine (NE). The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness and impulsivity. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons. while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.",

      "content": "The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates visual information with task demands to guide saccadic eye movements. Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.",

      "title": "Advancing High-Resolution 7T Diffusion MRI: Evaluating Phase-Encoding Correction Strategies for Distortion Correction from Basic to Four-Way Acquisitions",
      "content": "Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling. Data statement: Data will be made available in BIDS format in openneuro sharing platform upon acceptance of the manuscript. To be updated with DOI.",

      "title": "Anterior thalamic nucleus inputs to the retrosplenial cortex are unperturbed in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive function. Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.",

      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) present with complex behavioral symptoms that can arise in the absence of overt structural brain damage. Recent evidence suggests that border-associated macrophages (BAMs) located at the brain\u2019s interfaces regulate central nervous system function, yet the specific roles of distinct BAM subsets remain largely undefined. By reanalyzing single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem PD brains, we identified a BAM subset expressing CD169 that was significantly reduced in patients compared with controls. To examine their function, we employed CD169-DTR mice to selectively ablate CD169+ BAMs and evaluated behavioral and histological changes. Depletion of CD169+ BAMs induced tremors, abnormal hindlimb reflexes, and heightened anxiety-like behavior without dopaminergic neuron loss. Histological analysis revealed a pronounced reduction of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb, indicating disruption of olfactory-limbic circuitry. These findings demonstrate that CD169+ BAMs are critical for maintaining neural network stability and motor function, and that their loss can elicit PD-like phenotypes in the absence of classical dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This work establishes a novel mouse model linking brain-border immune cell dysfunction to Parkinsonian pathology and highlights a neuroimmune mechanism that may contribute to the onset of PD-like disorders.",
