      "title": "Advancing credibility and transparency in brain-to-image reconstruction research: Reanalysis of Koide-Majima, Nishimoto, and Majima (Neural Networks, 2024)",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.07960v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A recent high-profile study by Koide-Majima et al. (2024) claimed a major advance in reconstructing visual imagery from brain activity using a novel variant of a generative AI-based method. However, our independent reanalysis reveals multiple methodological concerns that raise questions about the validity of their conclusions. Specifically, our evaluation demonstrates that: (1) the reconstruction results are biased by selective reporting of only the best-performing examples at multiple levels; (2) performance is artificially inflated by circular metrics that fail to reflect perceptual accuracy; (3) fair baseline comparisons reveal no discernible advantages of the study's key innovations over existing techniques; (4) the central \"Bayesian\" sampling component is functionally inert, producing outcomes identical to the standard optimization result; and (5) even if the component were successfully implemented, the claims of Bayesian novelty are unsubstantiated, as the proposed method does not leverage the principles of a proper Bayesian framework. These systemic issues necessitate a critical reassessment of the study's contributions. This commentary dissects these deficiencies to underscore the need for greater credibility and transparency in the rapidly advancing field of brain decoding.",

      "title": "Inferring Hidden Motives: Bayesian Models of Preference Learning in Repeated Dictator Games",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.07825v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human cooperation depends on how accurately we infer others' motives--how much they value fairness, generosity, or self-interest from the choices they make. We model that process in binary dictator games, which isolate moral trade-offs between self and other stripped of strategic complexity. Participants observed others' allocation decisions and predicted their future behavior while playing through an exhaustive, randomized payoff space implemented on The Morality Game platform. We formalize social-preference learning as Bayesian belief updating over continuous parameters such as self-interest, altruism, envy, and guilt. The resulting Utility Bayesian Model (UBM) outperformed non-Bayesian alternatives and Bayesian models that categorize others into discrete social types. Because Bayesian updating requires a utility function in its likelihood term, we conducted the largest utility-function comparison to date--476 candidate forms differing in psychologically meaningful properties (e.g., payoff exponents, reference dependence, payoff ratios, and envy-guilt asymmetries). Exploring this joint space of payoffs and models allowed us to identify the function that unifies prior theories and generalizes across payoff conditions. Parameter estimation revealed moderate altruism, strong inequality aversion, and nonlinear payoff valuation (exponent > 1). Altruism and social-comparison motives were largely independent, revealing diverse moral phenotypes from cooperative to competitive or sadistic. Together, these findings provide a computational framework and a map of social motives, clarifying how humans learn whom to trust and offering quantitative foundations for promoting cooperation in social and artificial systems.",

      "title": "High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2504.13727v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive novel, precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.",

      "title": "Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.08436v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.",

We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.",

      "title": "Distance by de-correlation: Computing distance with heterogeneous grid cells",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.08292v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Encoding the distance between locations in space is essential for accurate navigation. Grid cells, a functional class of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, are believed to support this computation. However, existing theories of how populations of grid cells code distance rely on complex coding schemes, with assumptions that may not be met by anatomical constraints. Inspired by recent work finding grid cells to have small, but robust heterogeneity in their grid properties, we hypothesize that distance coding can be achieved by a simple de-correlation of population activity. We develop a mathematical theory for describing this de-correlation in one-dimension, showing that its predictions are consistent with simulations of noisy grid cells. Our simulations highlight a non-intuitive prediction of such a distance by de-correlation framework. Namely, that some further distances are better encoded than some nearer distances. We find evidence of this \"sweet spot\" in previously published rodent behavioral experiments and demonstrate that a decoder which estimates distance from the de-correlation of populations of simulated noisy grid cells leads to a similar pattern of errors. Finally, by simulating noisy grid cells in two-dimensions, we find that there exists a trade-off between the range of distances that can be encoded by de-correlation of population activity and the distinguishability of different distances, which is controlled by the amount of variability in grid properties. We show that the previously observed average amount of grid property variability strikes a balance between the two, enabling the encoding of distances up to several meters. Our work provides new insight on how grid cells can underlie the coding of distance, without the assumptions previously needed, and why grid cells may have small amounts of heterogeneity in their grid properties.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.08101v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper gives an in-depth theoretical analysis of the direction and speed selectivity properties of idealized models of the spatio-temporal receptive fields of simple cells and complex cells, based on the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.\n  By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii)~different visual neurons having broader {\\em vs.\\/}\\ sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.",

      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",
