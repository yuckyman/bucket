      "title": "Investigating the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in language evolution: insights from comparative neuroscience",
      "content": "The evolutionary adaptation of the left inferior frontal gyrus is considered a crucial neural specialization supporting the emergence of human language. As a central node in the language network, it is linked to the temporoparietal cortex via both the ventral and dorsal pathways. These connections enable humans to combine a limited set of vocal elements into infinitely diverse, hierarchically structured sequences. Although homologous brain structures are also present in non-human primates, language remains a uniquely human faculty. This review synthesizes anatomical, functional, and connectivity evidence across species to trace the evolution of the left inferior frontal gyrus in support of language. We argue that language did not emerge from novel cortical areas, but through the gradual repurposing, expansion, and optimization of pre-existing fronto-temporal circuits. Human-specific innovations include vocal neuron specialization, volumetric expansion, strengthened connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus, and a functional shift within the left inferior frontal gyrus from motor control to syntactic processing. Finally, we discuss how lesion studies contribute to our understanding of the brain\u2019s potential for language acquisition and its neurobiological constraints.",

      "title": "Investigating singing imagery as an additional or alternative control task for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces",
      "content": "IntroductionBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a movement-free means of communication and control, typically based on motor imagery (MI) tasks of hand, foot, or tongue movements. Most BCI studies focus on classifying up to four such tasks, which limits the number of available commands and restricts overall system functionality. Expanding the range of reliable mental tasks would directly increase the number of possible commands and thereby enhance the practical utility of BCIs. Singing imagery (SI) may offer an intuitive alternative or additional task to complement conventional MI paradigms.MethodsEEG data were recorded from 14 participants performing right-hand, left-hand, foot, and tongue MI, SI, and rest. Features were extracted using filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP), and tasks were classified with a random forest algorithm across 2-, 4-, 5-, and 6-class scenarios. Subjective data regarding participants' perceived task difficulty and general task preferences was also collected.ResultsClassification accuracies with SI included were comparable to subsets of conventional MI tasks in 2-, 4-, and 5-class scenarios. In the 6-class scenario, average accuracy was approximately 60%, with six participants exceeding 70%, the level often cited as being necessary for effective BCI control. It is reasonable to expect performance to improve further with more advanced analysis methods and participant training.ConclusionThese promising results suggest that singing imagery can serve as both an additional and an alternative task in MI-BCIs. In lower-class systems, SI may provide a valuable option for generating commands, particularly for users who may find some conventional MI tasks less intuitive. When combined with the established MI tasks, SI could increase the number of possible commands, thereby extending the functional capacity of BCI systems. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of SI to broaden the repertoire of mental tasks available for BCI control and to advance the development of more flexible, powerful, and user-centered BCI applications.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "content": "Neuroscience aims to understand how the structural and functional organization of the brain relates to behavior. Structural studies at the cellular level establish the neurobiological framework for understanding function. Structure is only part of the story however, with molecular and functional information needed for a comprehensive view. At the mesoscopic level, functional regions are defined by ensembles of neurons that work together. This perspective reviews the relationship between structural and functional organization across scales and aims to provide a common language for neuroscientists working at any level. While it is unequivocal that structure constrains function at the cellular level, understanding function at the meso- and macro-scopic scales is much more complicated involving ensembles of neurons and their dynamic interactions. Recognition of these scale differences is essential for advancing representational models in the field.",

      "content": "BackgroundHemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a severe complication following acute ischemic stroke, associated with neurological deterioration and poor clinical outcomes. Deep learning represents a promising tool for HT prediction.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of 474 acute ischemic stroke cases (231 HT and 243 non-HT) admitted to Beijing Tiantan Hospital from April 2014 to November 2022. We constructed a dataset from this cohort and randomly partitioned it into training and validation sets. Subsequently, we developed a model utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and residual networks based on computed tomography (CT) scans to predict HT after ischemic stroke.ResultsThe final dataset consisted of 613 CT scans. The model achieved an F1 score of 78.94% (95% CI, 67.7\u201386.4). The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.842 (95% CI, 75.8\u201392.1), sensitivity was 71.55% (95% CI, 60.6%\u221285.0%), and accuracy was 74.52% (95% CI, 63.9%\u221283.2%).ConclusionBy combining plain CT scans with deep learning methodologies, we developed a clinically applicable model with demonstrable interpretability. Primarily designed to predict HT after acute ischemic stroke, this model demonstrated significant performance advantages in testing compared to both clinical physicians and similar existing models.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Jetbase - A Modern Python Database Migration Tool (Alembic alternative)",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone! I built a database migration tool in Python called <a href=\"https://github.com/jetbase-hq/jetbase\">Jetbase</a>.</p> <p>I was looking for something more Liquibase / Flyway style than Alembic when working with more complex apps and data pipelines but didn\u2019t want to leave the Python ecosystem. So I built Jetbase as a Python-native alternative.</p> <p>Since Alembic is the main database migration tool in Python, here\u2019s a quick comparison:</p> <p>Jetbase has all the main stuff like upgrades, rollbacks, migration history, and dry runs, but also has a few other features that make it different.</p> <p><strong>Migration validation</strong></p> <p>Jetbase validates that previously applied migration files haven\u2019t been modified or removed before running new ones to prevent different environments from ending up with different schemas</p> <p>If a migrated file is changed or deleted, Jetbase fails fast.</p> <p>If you want Alembic-style flexibility you can disable validation via the config</p> <p><strong>SQL-first, not ORM-first</strong></p> <p>Jetbase migrations are written in <strong>plain SQL</strong>.</p> <p>Alembic supports SQL too, but in practice it\u2019s usually paired with SQLAlchemy. That didn\u2019t match how we were actually working anymore since we switched to always use plain SQL:</p> <ul> <li>Complex queries were more efficient and clearer in raw SQL</li> <li>ORMs weren\u2019t helpful for data pipelines (ex. S3 \u2192 Snowflake \u2192 Postgres)</li> <li>We explored and validated SQL queries directly in tools like DBeaver and Snowflake and didn\u2019t want to rewrite it into SQLAlchemy for our apps</li> <li>Sometimes we queried other teams\u2019 databases without wanting to add additional ORM models</li> </ul> <p><strong>Linear, easy-to-follow migrations</strong></p> <p>Jetbase enforces <strong>strictly ascending version numbers</strong>:</p> <p><code>1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u2192 4</code></p> <p>Each migration file includes the version in the filename:</p> <p><code>V1.5__create_users_table.sql</code></p> <p>This makes it easy to see the order at a glance rather than having random version strings. And jetbase has commands such as <code>jetbase history</code> and <code>jetbase status</code> to see applied versus pending migrations.</p> <p><strong>Linear migrations also leads to handling merge conflicts differently than Alembic</strong></p> <p>In Alembic\u2019s graph-based approach, if 2 developers create a new migration linked to the same down revision, it creates 2 heads. Alembic has to solve this merge conflict (flexible but makes things more complicated)</p> <p>Jetbase keeps migrations fully linear and chronological. There\u2019s always a single latest migration. If two migrations try to use the same version number, Jetbase fails immediately and forces you to resolve it before anything runs.</p> <p>The end result is a migration history that stays predictable, simple, and easy to reason about, especially when working on a team or running migrations in CI or automation.</p> <p><strong>Migration Locking</strong></p> <p>Jetbase has a lock to only allow one migration process to run at a time. It can be useful when you have multiple developers / agents / CI/CD processes running to stop potential migration errors or corruption.</p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/jetbase-hq/jetbase\">https://github.com/jetbase-hq/jetbase</a></p> <p>Docs: <a href=\"https://jetbase-hq.github.io/jetbase/\">https://jetbase-hq.github.io/jetbase/</a></p> <p><strong>Would love to hear your thoughts / get some feedback!</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s simple to get started:</p> <p><code>pip install jetbase</code></p> <pre><code># Initalize jetbase jetbase init </code></pre> <p><code>cd jetbase</code></p> <p>(Add your <code>sqlalchemy_url</code> to <code>jetbase/env.py</code>. Ex. sqlite:///<a href=\"http://test.db\">test.db</a>)</p> <pre><code># Generate new migration file: V1__create_users_table.sql: jetbase new \u201ccreate users table\u201d -v 1 # Add migration sql statements to file, then run the migration: jetbase upgrade </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Parking_Cicada_819\"> /u/Parking_Cicada_819 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qc7wxe/jetbase_a_modern_python_database_migration_tool/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qc7wxe/jetbase_a_modern_python_database_migration_tool/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<p class=\"\">A few years ago, we developed a universal metric of data quality for averaged ERPs called the standardized measurement error (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2020/4/28/data-quality\">click here</a> for more information). It has been available in ERPLAB for several years, and I\u2019m happy to announce that it is now available in BrainVision Analyzer 2.3.1 and in MNE-Python.</p><p class=\"\">For BrainVision Analyzer, it is available as a Solution. At this point, you need to request it from Brain Products.<a href=\"https://pressrelease.brainproducts.com/analyzer231/#04\"> Click here</a> and scroll down to the last part of the page for more information.</p><p class=\"\">For MNE-Python, it is accessed with the mne.stats.erp.compute_sme() function. <a href=\"https://mne.tools/1.8/generated/mne.stats.erp.compute_sme.html\">Click here</a> for details.</p><p class=\"\">If you want to see some examples of how this metric can be used, check out these recent papers:</p><ul><li><p class=\"\">Zhang, G., Garrett, D.
