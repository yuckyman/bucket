      "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

      "content": "Accurate pose estimation underpins quantitative analysis of behavior, yet many deep learning-based tracking tools remain optimized for offline workflows that rely on fragmented software pipelines, workstation-grade GPUs, or external middleware to enable real-time deployment. Here we present an integrated software-hardware ecosystem for pose estimation that spans dataset creation, model training, offline analysis, and real-time deployment on embedded edge-computing devices. SqueakPose Studio provides a software suite for whole-frame, deep learning-based pose estimation that unifies dataset creation, manual and model-assisted labeling, model training, validation, and large-scale offline inference. The system leverages modern object-detection architectures to enable efficient end-to-end training and inference without patch-based sampling or multi-stage postprocessing, and supports execution on CPUs, GPUs, and Apple Silicon. For experimental settings requiring continuous recording and synchronized data acquisition, SqueakView enables real-time model deployment, video capture, and sensor logging on embedded edge-computing hardware, while MouseHouse provides a compact, modular enclosure designed for home cage-based experiments that integrates embedded GPU compute, microcontroller-based timing, and peripheral I/O. A shared data format and deterministic timing architecture ensure consistency across offline analysis and real-time deployment. Together, SqueakPose Studio, SqueakView, and MouseHouse provide a unified platform for pose estimation that supports both conventional offline analysis and embedded, real-time experimentation, without reliance on workstation-grade hardware or external middleware.",

      "title": "Predicting driver distraction using a single channel ear EEG",
      "content": "Cognitive distraction poses a major risk to driving safety, yet remains difficult to detect in real time because it often lacks overt behavioral markers. Neurophysiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) provide objective indices of cognitive load, but conventional EEG systems are impractical for real-world deployment due to their intrusiveness and computational demands. The present study examined whether cognitive distraction during naturalistic driving can be decoded using a single-channel, non-invasive in-ear EEG, and how its temporal dynamics compare with those obtained from full-cap scalp EEG and behavioral measures. Twenty-seven participants performed a dual-task paradigm in a highly immersive driving simulator, combining continuous vehicle control with low- and high-load arithmetic tasks presented on an in-vehicle display. Single-channel in-ear EEG, 24-channel scalp EEG, eye movements, and head rotation were recorded concurrently. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis was applied to decode working-memory load with millisecond precision across modalities. Cognitive distraction was reliably decoded from in-ear EEG, with detection latency and temporal generalization profiles closely matching those of full-cap scalp EEG. Although peak decoding performance was higher for scalp EEG, the timing and temporal stability of distraction-related neural signatures were largely overlapping between the two neural modalities. Eye velocity provided the earliest and most sensitive behavioral marker of distraction, while head rotation contributed complementary but weaker information. Scalp EEG topographies indicated that neural signals underlying decoding were closely linked to oculomotor and visuomotor processes engaged during task performance. These findings demonstrate that single-channel in-ear EEG provides a temporally precise and low-burden neural marker of cognitive distraction during driving. By prioritizing early detection and minimal hardware over maximal classification accuracy, the results identify a practical operating point for wearable EEG-based driver monitoring systems and support the feasibility of fast, off-the-shelf decoding approaches for real-world applications.",

      "title": "A Primary Central Source Determines Perturbation-Evoked N1 Amplitudes but not Latencies in Younger Adults",
      "content": "The balance perturbation-evoked N1 potential is a reliable cortical response during reactive balance control that is correlated to a variety of cognitive and motor functions. Although the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the primary source of the N1, it is less understood whether other brain regions contribute to N1 recorded at the scalp. We used source localization on electroencephalography (EEG) data from 25 younger adults recorded during backward whole-body perturbations during stance. We identified the sources that contribute to channel-based N1 recordings and quantified their impact on N1 amplitude and latency. In younger adults, N1 amplitudes can be explained by one single source in a central midline cortical region covering the SMA. When reconstructing N1 signals using backprojections with one versus all independent components (IC) identified as brain sources there was no difference in peak amplitudes and a small but significant difference in N1 peak latencies. Parallel brain sources thus deflect the time course of the N1, but not its magnitude. Brain areas associated with IC's contributing to the shift in N1 latency varied between participants. Our results emphasize the dominant influence of central cortical areas on the N1 response, informing hypothesizes regarding the nature of the signal and its functional role. Importantly, the extent and location of other cortical structures that influence N1 timing, such as parietal cortex areas and the anterior cingulate cortex, may further elucidate cortical contributions to balance. These markers could be crucial for the early detection of balance problems in clinical populations.",

      "title": "Effects of delay and amplification of auditory feedback for walking: anticipation, variability, and frequency adaptation.",
      "content": "When walking, we generate rich acoustic information through our footsteps. This sound stream contains information about footfall timing, dragging, loading rate, etc. The role of this endogenous auditory feedback in gait control remains underexplored. Building on work in delayed auditory feedback (DAF) for speech and on theories of sensorimotor coupling, we investigated whether manipulating the delay and amplification of self-produced footstep sounds modulates gait dynamics. Thirty healthy young adults walked overground while receiving real-time lateralized playback of the sound close to their feet using shoe-mounted microphones, belt-worn micro-computer, and headphones, all connected with cables for minimal latency. Across conditions, auditory feedback was delivered with no delay, low delay (12.5% step duration), or high delay (25% step duration), and at either full or half amplification. There was also a masked hearing condition with pink noise. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, namely cadence, speed, stride length, and coefficient of variation were analyzed as percent change relative to baseline. We found that amplification without delay reduced variability by almost 10% on average, consistent with strengthened sensorimotor coupling via enhanced perceptual access to foot-ground interaction dynamics. A second interesting finding was that delay increased the cadence of walking instead of reducing it, contrary to our expectations. We discussed how this effect can be explained by both Bayesian predictive coding and anticipatory dynamic systems with delayed feedback. We developed a theoretical model with anticipatory dynamics, with implications for closed-loop gait rehabilitation tools.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

      "title": "The effects of electrical stimulation on neurons and glia of the central nervous system",
      "content": "Objective. This review paper focuses on how both direct current (DC) stimulation and alternating current (AC) stimulation affects the central nervous system\u2019s (CNSs) cells and its potential as a neurotherapeutic. Furthermore, addressing the promise of combinatorial approaches that utilize other treatments alongside electrical stimulation (ES) and how ES has shaped clinical approaches as a new rehabilitation treatment. Approach. Authors conducted this review to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation; 124 manuscripts were identified through Google Scholar for insights into ES effects on neurons and glia in both in vitro and in vivo models. Main results. The review summarizes findings from DC and AC stimulation paradigms applied to in vitro or in vivo preclinical models and summarizes the promise of ES when applied clinically. Generally, DC stimulation promotes axonal extension towards the cathode, while axons retract at the anode, limiting regeneration. AC stimulation alternates electrode polarity, enabling axonal extension in both directions. The intensity and duration of ES significantly affects the extent of neurite outgrowth. For astrocytes and microglia, ES\u2014whether AC or DC\u2014downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting A2 or M2 reactive states conducive to regeneration, respectively. Regarding oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both DC and AC stimulation enhance OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, increasing myelin content and supporting axonal myelination. ES, when combined with stem cell treatments, drug delivery approaches, or with electroactive biomaterials, facilitate greater efficacy of these approaches. Clinically, short-single sessions of ES have shown long-term improvement. More specifically, preliminary efforts have been implemented to restore gait, hand tremors, and speech in spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and stroke patients, respectively. Significance. ES is an evolving neurotherapeutic strategy for CNS related disease or injuries. Understanding how ES modulates neurons and glia is critical for optimizing its application in the clinic.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot.

As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "title": "Case Report: Effective management of a Meige syndrome patient with subthalamic stimulation-induced dyskinesia through timed stimulation programming of different contacts",
      "content": "IntroductionMeige syndrome is a rare adult-onset segmental dystonia characterized by blepharospasms and oromandibular dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment, but it can lead to stimulation-induced dyskinesia (SID) in some patients. Refractory SID in Meige syndrome after STN-DBS is clinically challenging. We report a case of a Meige syndrome patient who developed refractory SID following STN-DBS and was successfully managed using a novel timed-stimulation programming strategy employing different contacts.Case descriptionA 47-year-old female with a two-year history of Meige syndrome developed refractory SID after the treatment of STN-DBS. Various programming strategies were attempted, including monopolar stimulation, interleaved stimulation, bipolar stimulation et al., but none achieved a balance between symptom control and SID. A novel approach involving timed alternation between ventral contacts (contacts 3 and 7) and dorsal contacts (contacts 4 and 8) was implemented. The stimulation was gradually programmed, the duration of ventral stimulation was increased while decreasing dorsal stimulation. Eventually, the patient achieved significant symptom improvement without SID. The reconstruction of the volume of tissue activated (VTA) revealed that this stimulation strategy likely modulates the neural circuits of pallidothalamic fibers (PTF) to suppress SID.ConclusionThis case demonstrates that this noval timed stimulation programming can effectively manage refractory SID in Meige syndrome patients, offering a viable alternative when conventional methods fail. The findings suggest that PTF stimulation plays a key role in SID suppression, and this strategy warrants further investigation in larger cohorts.",
