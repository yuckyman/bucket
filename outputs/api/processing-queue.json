      "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
      "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "title": "Deletion or Targeted Blockade of Fc\u03b3RIIb (CD32b) Impairs \u03b1-Syn Propagation In-Vivo",
      "content": "Parkinsons disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, is characterised by pervasive deposition of alpha-synuclein (-Syn) aggregates and the death of dopaminergic neurons. Fc gamma receptor IIb (Fc{gamma}RIIb or CD32b), the sole inhibitory Fc{gamma}R in humans (h) and mice (m), serves as a molecular conduit for intercellular -Syn transmission in-vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Fc{gamma}RIIb facilitates -Syn propagation and neurotoxicity in-vivo using the pre-formed fibril (PFF) -Syn model in mice. Genetic ablation of mFc{gamma}RII attenuated PFF -Syn-induced Lewy pathology, dampened associated neuroinflammatory responses, and preserved nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of hFc{gamma}RIIb using clinically-related monoclonal antibodies mitigated acute-phase -Syn pathology in hFc{gamma}RIIb-transgenic mice following PFF challenge. Collectively, our results indicate that Fc{gamma}RIIb is a mediator of -Syn propagation in-vivo and highlight it as a tractable therapeutic target against -synucleinopathies like PD.",

      "title": "Local differences in baseline sodium shape astrocytic potassium uptake by the NKA",
      "content": "Astrocytes are vital for the maintenance of ion and transmitter homeostasis in the extracellular space, with the inward Na gradient playing a pivotal role in these processes. Earlier studies not only reported a low baseline Na+ concentration ([Na+]) in astrocytes, but also suggested an equilibration of [Na+] within the gap-junction-coupled syncytium. This is consistent with the view that the basic homeostatic properties of astrocytes are largely identical due to their critical role in brain function. Here, we used multi-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging for a quantitative determination of astrocytic [Na+] in mouse forebrain tissue slices and in vivo. Contrary to the prevailing notion of a rather uniform Na distribution, we detected a previously unobserved subcellular and cellular heterogeneity in astrocytic [Na+], accompanied by differences in the capacity for Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA)-mediated uptake of extracellular K+. Biophysical modelling showed that this heterogeneity can be replicated by the reported differential expression of NKA isoforms in astrocytes together with a different strength of Na+ influx over the plasma membranes. Altogether, our results thus suggest the existence of functionally distinct astrocytes and astrocyte subdomains in which Na+ homeostasis is locally adapted to the specific requirements of surrounding neural networks.",

      "title": "Cell-autonomous mitochondrial calcium flux governs oligodendrocyte regeneration",
      "content": "Oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells drive central nervous system remyelination, yet the intrinsic mechanisms that define their regenerative potential remain unclear. We identify spontaneous, cell-autonomous intracellular Ca2+ signaling as a critical mechanism regulating OL regeneration following demyelination. Longitudinal in vivo imaging and ex vivo recordings reveal that Ca2+ signaling arises intrinsically within OL lineage cells after demyelination, and occurs independently from neuronal or behavioral activity. Mechanistically, mitochondrial Ca2+ flux sustains intracellular Ca2+ signals in oligodendroglia, and its in vivo disruption impairs oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation, differentiation, and repopulation at the lesion site. Conversely, enhancing oligodendroglial Ca2+ signaling in vivo using chemogenetics stimulates lineage expansion and differentiation. In primary human OPC cultures, modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ flux similarly reduces proliferation, indicating a conserved role for this pathway across species. These findings identify mitochondrial Ca2+ flux as a central driver of the oligodendroglial regeneration and a potential therapeutic target in demyelinating diseases.",

      "title": "Injury-induced nuclear export of RNA-binding proteins drives mRNA stabilization and translation to promote dendrite regeneration",
      "content": "Dendrite regeneration is critical for restoring neuronal connectivity after injury, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using C. elegans as a model and through a forward genetic screen, we identified the conserved insulin degrading enzyme idr-1 and the RNA-binding protein rbm-42 as key regulators of dendrite regeneration, where idr-1 functions upstream of rbm-42. We further show that ced-7, one of the core components of the phagocytosis pathway, acting downstream of rbm-42, while other components of this pathway don't play significant roles in dendrite regeneration. In addition, we demonstrate that upon injury IDR-1 can promote RBM-42 nuclear export following injury, enabling its dendritic localization. RBM-42, in turn, promotes the translation of ced-7 and facilitates microtubule assembly. In conclusion, our findings define a novel conserved signaling cascade coupling injury-induced nuclear export of RNA binding proteins to local regulation and dendrite regeneration, providing new mechanistic insight into neuronal repair.",
