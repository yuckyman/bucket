      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Preliminary ERP evidence of the impact of loneliness on Stroop interference for socio-emotional stimuli",
      "content": "Growing evidence highlights the adverse clinical effects and societal implications of loneliness, i.e., the negative feeling associated with a perceived discrepancy between desired and existing social connections. To further understand the implicit attentional and cognitive control processes associated with loneliness, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the relationship between loneliness levels and brain activity underlying attentional capture in a socio-emotional Stroop task. In keeping with previous reports of three-stage processing of socio-emotional words, positive\u2013negative valence and social-individual content of word stimuli were reflected in the amplitude of ERP components associated with high-order perceptual processing and preliminary emotional decoding (P200), emotional and semantic processing (P300), and interference suppression (N450). In the later stage, the differential N450 amplitude associated with processing socially negative compared with control-neutral stimuli was negatively correlated with self-perceived loneliness levels. This finding suggests that social negative and neutral stimuli are processed more dissimilarly at higher levels of self-perceived loneliness, possibly due to increased hypervigilance toward negative social cues, like those associated with rejection or exclusion. By elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of loneliness on socio-cognitive processing, these findings provide novel insights that can guide future research and inform the development of innovative therapeutic interventions that target the consequences of perceived social disconnection.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo explore the risk factors of cognitive dysfunction in patients with leukoaraiosis (LA) and to construct a predictive model using machine learning.MethodsA total of 273 patients with LA were included. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for cognitive dysfunction. The patients were divided into a training set (191 cases) and a validation set (82 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. Seven machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, GBDT, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost) were employed to construct predictive models. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, recall, F1 score, MCC, AUROC, and SHAP was used for model interpretation.ResultsUnivariate analysis revealed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, CRP, Fazekas score, and IASA score were associated with cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, LDL-C, uric acid, Fazekas score, and IASA score were independent risk factors (p < 0.05). Among the machine learning algorithms, the Random Forest model performed the best, with an AUROC of 0.8373 for the validation set. SHAP analysis indicated that age, LDL-C, IASA score, and Fazekas score were the most important predictors.ConclusionThe Random Forest model can be used to predict the risk of cognitive dysfunction in patients with LA, providing a reference for early warning.",

      "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",
