      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "content": "Sensory-evoked cortical responses vary with global network dynamics, yet the link between cortical state and stimulus processing remains unclear. Here, we introduce a paradigm that jointly decodes stimulus identity and network state from wide-field calcium imaging in mice undergoing multisensory and optogenetic stimulation across isoflurane-induced transitions from compartmentalized to synchronized activity. Effective dimensionality, a summary measure of network complexity, correlated well with anesthesia depth, while non-linear contrastive learning achieved >97% stimulus decoding accuracy across all states. Individual cortical regions maintained [&ge;]82.5% accuracy even during deep anesthesia with prominent slow waves. Preservation of stimulus-specific information extended throughout the cortex, demonstrating that distinct representations remain decodable within synchronized networks. Direct optogenetic cortical stimulation exhibited state-invariant decoding performance, contrasting with anesthesia-dependent decline observed for sensory stimuli. Multi-stimulus cortical representations remain decodable across varying levels of network synchronization, with implications for brain-machine interfaces and clinical tools that assess preserved cortical responsiveness under variable arousal conditions.",

      "content": "The midbrain dopamine system is important for linking reward-predictive cues to learning and motivation. Here we investigated how dopamine neuron responses to food and water cues are modulated by changes in internal state. We developed a flexible cued-approach task that allowed us to examine behavioral and neural responses to both food- and water-predictive cues within the same recording session. We found that overlapping subsets of dopamine neurons respond to food and water cues, but that the magnitude of these responses is gated in a need-specific way. Stimulation of hunger-promoting AgRP neurons amplified dopamine neuron responses to food cues, but not water cues, and the magnitude of these responses exceeded those observed in natural hunger. These findings indicate that changes in internal state modulate, in a need-appropriate way, the responses of a common set of dopamine neurons to environmental signals of food and water availability.",

      "title": "Pleasant touch mediated by A\u03b2-afferents remains primarily dependent on tactile velocity",
      "content": "Pleasantness of touch is classically attributed to C-tactile (CT) afferents, based on multiple evidence showing identical inverted-U curves as a function of velocities for pleasantness and CT activity. Recent research suggests that pleasant touch is not solely mediated by CT activation, pointing to a potential contribution of A{beta}-afferents and cognitive processes, potentially through the mechanism of velocity inference. To investigate the contributions of A{beta}-afferents, our study compared the illusion of vibrotactile apparent motion, which recruits almost exclusively A{beta}-afferents, and brush stroking, which additionally recruits CT afferents. A first experiment investigated the impact of stroke contrast on the pleasantness of 3 cm/s strokes by mingling them with pleasant (1 and 10 cm/s) or less pleasant (0.5 and 30 cm/s) ones. A second experiment in virtual reality probed velocity inference from visual cue by testing how congruence between visual and tactile velocity affects perceived pleasantness. The results showed that the pleasantness of strokes targeting A{beta}-afferents also follows an inverted U-curve and that 3 cm/s reference strokes remained unaffected by the speed of mixed strokes regardless of the condition. Even though differences in incongruence were not clearly perceived, discrepant visual velocities influenced the pleasantness of vibrotactile 1 cm/s strokes, for which the pleasantness ratings followed the visual rather than the tactile velocity. Overall, vibrotactile pleasantness can be mediated by A{beta}-afferents, but most probably through velocity inference since only vibrotactile strokes were prone to visual illusion. Because not clearly detected, visual inferences could have played a stronger role through larger speed discrepancies.",

      "title": "Exploring Stress-Induced Neural Circuit Remodeling through Data-Driven Analysis and Artificial Neural Network Simulation",
      "content": "Chronic stress induces behavioral rigidity and neural circuit remodeling, yet the underlying computational mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we analyze in vivo GCaMP8s recordings from the amygdala-striatal circuits (Giovanniello et al.) and identify a difference in the recovery dynamics of the BLA-DMS and CeA-DMS pathways following acute perturbations. Through data analysis and artificial neural network modeling, we find that structural asymmetry and functional separation--formalized by distinct optimization objectives--are necessary for simulating the experimental results. This suggests that the divergent functions of the BLA-DMS (exploration/precision) and CeA-DMS (stabilization/homeostasis) pathways are inherent, not learned. Under chronic stress, the brain adapts by strengthening the CeA-DMS pathway's stabilizing role. A robustness test (10 independent seeds) confirmed the statistical reliability of the results (e.g., Recovery Time difference), yet revealed a high Coefficient of Variation in pathway coupling weights ( approximately 40%), suggesting the brain preserves structural flexibility even while enforcing rigid functional outcomes. The model replicates the observed outcomes, suggesting that the chronic stress is computationally equivalent to a gain shift favoring the stable CeA-DMS pathway.",

      "title": "Lifelong maintenance of locomotion by embryonically active dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Locomotor skills arise early in life and must be maintained throughout the lifespan, yet how this continuity is achieved despite major neural remodeling remains unclear. Using Drosophila, which undergoes complete metamorphosis, we show that dopamine neurons (DANs) are active during the embryonic stage and that this early activity is essential for locomotion across all developmental stages and adulthood. Through stage-specific behavioral assays, optogenetics, in vivo brain imaging, and fluorescent neuronal tracking, we identify a subset of ventral nervous system (VNS) DANs that modulate locomotor function throughout life. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that they maintain expression of developmental transcription factors. Knocking down these factors in post-mitotic VNS DANs impairs adult locomotion. These findings uncover a previously overlooked function for embryonic DANs and suggest that stable locomotion during nervous system maturation relies on persistent developmental regulator expression coupled with structural remodeling.",

      "title": "Higher inter-trial latency variability contributes to reduced visual EEG responses in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Patients with schizophrenia show strong impairments in visual backward masking, which are associated with reduced EEG N1 responses. However, it is currently unclear whether reduced N1 amplitudes in patients reflect attenuated neural responses or increased inter-trial latency variability, as both can lead to reduced trial-averaged responses. Previous studies using trial-averaged data cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Here, we estimated inter-trial latency variability of the visual N1 component and found significantly increased variability in patients compared to controls. Inter-trial latency-variability was a strong predictor of the N1 amplitude in both groups. Importantly, after accounting for the effect of latency variability in the group comparison, patients continued to exhibit significantly reduced N1 amplitudes, although the effect size diminished from large to medium. These findings indicate that both higher latency variability and attenuated neural responses contribute to visual processing deficits in schizophrenia.",
