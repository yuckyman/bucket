      "title": "Intrinsic excitability of rat hippocampal granule cells increases along the dorsal-to-ventral axis",
      "content": "The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus exhibits striking anatomical and functional heterogeneity along its dorsoventral axis, yet the intrinsic electrophysiological diversity of its principal excitatory neurons, the granule cells, across the dorsoventral axis remains unexplored. Here, we systematically examined the electrophysiological properties of DG granule cells across the dorsal, intermediate, and ventral regions of the rat hippocampus. We found a progressive increase in input resistance, impedance amplitude, and firing rate of granule cells, accompanied by a gradual slowdown in repolarization kinetics of their action potentials along the dorsal-to-ventral axis. Our analyses demonstrated that granule cells acted as class I integrators that lacked strong resonance properties across the dorsoventral axis. We performed pairwise correlation and dimensionality reduction analyses to reveal weak dependencies across physiological measurements and the absence of distinct clusters for dorsal, intermediate, or ventral granule cells. Importantly, blade-specific analyses of granule cell physiology revealed that all measurements manifested pronounced heterogeneities even within a given dorsoventral section and a specific blade. Strikingly, ventral granule cells in the infrapyramidal blade manifested higher firing rates compared to their counterparts in the suprapyramidal blade. These blade-specific differences were limited to the ventral granule cells, with negligible distinctions between granule cells in the two blades of either dorsal or intermediate hippocampus. Together, our findings unveil a progressive increase in excitability of DG granule cells along the dorsal-to-ventral axis and a blade-specific granularity of firing properties, adding new dimensions to the several known anatomical, molecular, and behavioral differences across the hippocampal dorsoventral axis.",

      "content": "The embryonic medial and lateral ganglionic eminences (MGE, LGE) are the principal sources of most neurons and glia for the basal ganglia. In primates, the MGE has a distinctive cytoarchitecture characterized by doublecortin enriched cellular nests (DENs), yet the architectonic organization underlying DEN formation, the molecular heterogeneity of ganglionic eminence progenitors and their lineage relationships, remain poorly understood. Here, using paired single-nucleus transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling of the three GEs, we identify distinct progenitor populations, delineate their gene regulatory networks, and reconstruct their lineage trajectories. Live imaging reveals a unipolar outer radial glia-like population (GE-oRG) that undergoes mitotic somal translocation. Spatial transcriptomics identifies a distinct CRABP1+/ANGPT2+ domain within the MGE. Integrated spatial and electron microscopy demonstrates a periphery-to-center gradient of differentiation in the MGE. Leveraging DEN-forming MGE organoids derived from PCDH19 knockout human pluripotent stem cell lines, we identify the protocadherin, PCDH19, as a key regulator of DEN formation.",

      "content": "The SEZ6 family, composed of SEZ6, SEZ6L, and SEZ6L2, plays essential roles in neurodevelopment, synaptic organization, and complement regulation. However, the specific contribution of SEZ6L2 to brain function remains largely unexplored. In this study, we provide the first comprehensive behavioral and neurobiological characterization of Sez6l2 knockout (KO) mice and directly compare their phenotype with Sez6 triple knockout (TKO) mice, which lack all three Sez6 family genes. Sez6l2 KO mice exhibit impairments across multiple behavioral domains, including motor coordination, gait, sociability, sensory processing, and goal-directed repetitive behaviors. Several phenotypes, particularly motor deficits, worsen with age. Male Sez6l2 KO mice also demonstrate enhanced fear learning and increased prepulse inhibition, revealing sex-specific alterations in sensorimotor gating. At the synaptic level, Sez6l2 KO mice show reduced dendritic spine length and decreased expression of key postsynaptic proteins suggesting impaired excitatory synaptic connectivity. These structural and molecular abnormalities likely contribute to the observed behavioral deficits. In comparison, Sez6 TKO mice display more severe impairments across most measures. Together, these findings establish SEZ6L2 as a critical and non-redundant regulator of motor, cognitive, and synaptic function and provide mechanistic insight into how dysfunction within the SEZ6 family may contribute to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "content": "While the experience of stress is ubiquitous, the risk of developing stress-linked conditions such as anxiety and depression is related to maladaptive stress responses. In order to probe the relationship between stress coping, sex, and stress-linked behavioral outcomes, we exposed male and female mice to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) and measured the correlation between coping during the tail suspension stressors (TSS) of SCVS and avoidance behavior in the EPM. We found that females engage in more active coping, and there were no sex differences in avoidance or locomotor behavior in the EPM after stress. However, we found that greater active coping predicted greater avoidance in females, but less avoidance in males. The results demonstrate that coping strategies are dynamic across time in males and females, but the relationships between avoidance and coping strategy dynamics are sex-biased.",

      "title": "Meta-learning is expressed through altered prefrontal cortical dynamics",
      "content": "Learning where and when rewards like food and water are available is essential for survival. In the simplest cases where resource availability is stable, animals can learn reward contingencies by integrating outcomes across repeated samples of each option. In more natural settings, however, reward availability is governed by complex contingencies such as depletion and repletion over time. To flexibly adapt to such changing environments, optimal choices require meta-learning wherein animals learn how to learn from external feedback, eventually enabling them to infer reward contingencies from more abstract and generalizable rules rather than relying solely on recent outcomes. The existence of meta-learning in animal behavior is well established, yet the neural circuits and computations that implement it remain poorly understood. Here we investigated meta-learning using a spatial foraging task in which rats acquired a novel depletion-repletion rule, and carried out longitudinal, high-density recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We show that meta-learning engages specific, systematic changes in mPFC neural dynamics that embed the learned rule and thereby alter the way the network learns option values from reward outcomes. These dynamics are based on mixed coding of task structure and value in individual mPFC neurons which, at the population level, organize into low-dimensional dynamical motifs that generalize across task conditions. As meta-learning progresses, these motifs are reshaped to instantiate both rule-guided inference of future states before outcome delivery and rule-based value updating during the outcome period. These results indicate that meta-learning sculpts pre-existing prefrontal dynamics to support the acquisition of new reward-learning strategies.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
      "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

      "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

The problem is that standard exports are a total mess: thousands of files, random filenames, metadata dates set to &quot;today&quot; and worst of all, the text captions/stickers are separated from the images (stored as transparent PNGs).</p> <p>I spent some time building a complete workflow to solve these issues, and I decided to share it open-source on GitHub.</p> <p><strong>What this project does:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>The Guide:</strong> It consolidates all the necessary steps, including the correct ExifTool commands (from the original downloader's documentation) to restore the correct &quot;Date Taken&quot; so your gallery is chronological.</li> <li><strong>The Scripts (My contribution):</strong> I wrote a suite of Python scripts that automatically: <ul> <li><strong>Organize:</strong> Moves files out of the weird date-code folders and sorts them into a clean <code>Year &gt; Month</code> structure.</li> <li><strong>Rename:</strong> Cleans up the filenames inside the folders to match the directory dates.</li> <li><strong>Merge Overlays:</strong> This is the big one. It detects if a video/photo has a separate overlay file (the text/stickers) and uses FFmpeg to &quot;burn&quot; it back onto the media permanently. It even handles resizing so the text doesn't get cut off.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s a collection of instructions and Python scripts designed for Windows (but adaptable for Mac/Linux).

      "content": "This paper examines the extent to which large language models (LLMs) are able to perform tasks which require higher-order theory of mind (ToM)\u2014the human ability to reason about multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g., I think that you believe that she knows). This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite\u2014Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&amp;A\u2014and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs of varying sizes and training paradigms to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on our ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for higher-order ToM performance, and that the linguistic abilities of large models may support more complex ToM inferences. Given the important role that higher-order ToM plays in group social interaction and relationships, these findings have significant implications for the development of a broad range of social, educational and assistive LLM applications.",

      "content": "BackgroundIschemic stroke is an acute neurological disorder with limited treatment options. Medical cannabinoids (MCs), primary bioactive compounds extracted from cannabis plants, have shown therapeutic prospects for ischemic stroke. This study integrates bibliometrics and meta-analysis to comprehensively summarize the research landscape of MCs in cerebral ischemia and thoroughly investigate their role and potential mechanisms in ischemic stroke.MethodsBibliometric analysis was performed based on literature retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), PubMed, and Scopus. For meta-analysis, a comprehensive search was conducted across four databases (WoSCC, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) and grey literature repositories. Studies were screened according to predefined criteria. Pooled standardized mean differences with 95% confidence interval were calculated, followed by subgroup analysis.ResultsA total of 241 publications were identified for bibliometric analysis. From 2000 to June 2025, the annual publication output on MCs in cerebral ischemia displayed a fluctuating yet overall upward trend. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed three major research topics: neuroprotective mechanisms of MCs, pathological models of cerebral ischemia, and bioactive components of MCs. Meta-analysis of 26 studies demonstrated that MCs provided significant neuroprotection in animal models of ischemic stroke, including cerebral infarct volume, neurological function score (NFS), cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) permeability, brain water content, apoptosis (TUNEL-positive cells), oxidative stress markers, inflammation (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2), and excitotoxicity (Glu/NAA, Lac/NAA ratio). Subgroup analysis revealed that intraperitoneal administration and a full-course of cannabidiol (CBD) treatment were associated with reduced heterogeneity and enhanced therapeutic benefit. Isoflurane was identified as a potentially suitable anesthetic.ConclusionMCs exert multi-target neuroprotection in ischemic stroke by improving CBF, reducing brain edema and BBB permeability, and inhibiting oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity. Future research should focus on high-quality clinical trials to validate these findings and translate MCs into clinical practice.Systematic review registrationhttps://osf.io/6je7n.",
