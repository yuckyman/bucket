      "title": "Characterisation of cold-selective lamina I spinal projection neurons",
      "content": "Skin cooling is detected by primary afferents that express the Trpm8 channel, but how this information is conveyed to the brain remains poorly understood. We have previously identified a population of lamina I projection neurons belonging to the anterolateral system (ALS) that receive numerous contacts from Trpm8-expressing primary afferents. Here, using a semi-intact somatosensory preparation, we show that these cells correspond to the cold-selective ALS neurons identified in previous physiological studies. We also confirm the presence of synapses from Trpm8 afferents onto these cells at the ultrastructural level. Based on our previous transcriptomic findings, we identify calbindin as a molecular marker, and show that this can be used to target the cold-selective ALS neurons for anterograde tracing studies. We provide evidence that they project to 3 brain regions that are associated with thermosensation: the rostralmost part of the lateral parabrachial area, the caudal part of the periaqueductal grey matter, and the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Our findings provide important insights into the organisation of neuronal circuits that underlie thermoregulation and the perception of cold stimuli applied to the skin.",

      "title": "Differential effects of aging and Alzheimer's disease on microemboli clearance in a mouse model of microinfarction",
      "content": "Background: Cerebral microinfarcts often occur as a result of microvessel occlusion and are prevalent among dementia patients and the aging population. Detailed studies on the timecourse of microvascular occlusions indicate that endogenous mechanisms exist to re-canalize occluded vessels. One recently discovered mechanism is angiophagy, where vessels engulf and expel microemboli, thus mitigating damage caused by micro-occlusions. While several previous studies have shown that angiophagy occurs in rodent models, the frequency and timing of this process is not well characterized. In addition, there is limited data on the impact of aging on angiophagy, or the occurrence of this process in clinically relevant diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Methods: To further study the timecourse of angiophagy, we induced micro-occlusions in young, aged and 3xTg Alzheimer's mice via injection of 20um microspheres into the carotid artery. Mice were sacrificed on day 3, 7 or 14 and the brains were processed for brain-wide localization of microspheres and quantification of angiophagy. Results: We found the largest number of microspheres in the neocortex, yet when accounting for region size, microspheres were more evenly distributed across brain regions. When quantifying angiophagy in young non-diseased mice, we found that approximately 43% of microspheres had extravasated from the vessel by day 14. This process was delayed in aged mice, with only 10% of microspheres extravasated by day 14. Moreover, in young 3xTg Alzheimer's mice, we found the rate of angiophagy to be more efficient at day 14 compared to non-transgenic controls, with 47% and 43% of microspheres extravasated, respectively. A similar trend was observed in aged Alzheimer?s mice, in which 38% of microspheres were extravasated by day 14 in 3xTg mice, compared to only 30% in non-transgenic controls. Conclusions: Taken together, we find that while aging impairs the process of angiophagy, Alzheimer's mice exhibit a paradoxical increase in the rate of microsphere extravasation.",

      "title": "Attention Defines the Context for Implicit Sensorimotor Adaptation",
      "content": "<p>The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
      "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

      "title": "An adaptive transformer-based framework for advanced brain activity mapping and intelligent neurotherapeutic decision support",
      "content": "IntroductionIdentification and treatment of neurological disorders depend much on brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision support. Although they are loud, do not remain in one spot, and are rather complex, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the principal tool used in research of brain function. This work employs an Adaptive Transformer-based technique with improved attention processes to extract temporal and spatial relationships in EEG data, effectively addressing these issues.MethodsFirst processed to eliminate noise and split them into time-series chunks, EEG data are then included into the proposed approach. Channel-wise embeddings and temporal encoding help to depict the data. Then, a transformer design including spatial attention for inter-channel interactions, multi-head self-attention for temporal aspects, and an adaptive attention mask for domain-specific modifications is used. Other openly accessible EEG datasets as well as the TUH EEG Corpus and CHB-MIT were evaluated against the model. Its performance was scored using metrics like accuracy, precision, memory, and F1-score.ResultsThe suggested method was more accurate than standard models like CNNs and LSTMs, with a score of 98.24%. The method was also shown to be able to find minor patterns in EEG data by improving precision and memory. Attention maps showed important areas of time and space, which made them easier to understand and useful in professional settings.DiscussionThe Adaptive Transformer turns out to be a useful tool for neurotherapeutic use of EEG data modeling. The approach provides greater medical assistance and knowledge on the functioning of the brain as well as answers significant issues. Future research might focus on subject-specific modifications and interaction with real-time systems.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in revolutionizing EEG analysis for precision brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision-making.",

This framework offers a scalable solution for enhancing the operational safety and efficiency of modern air-traffic control systems.",

      "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

      "title": "Toothy: an interactive platform for dentate spike curation",
      "content": "Dentate spikes (DSs) are hippocampal population events that occur during low-arousal states, defined by large-amplitude positive voltage peaks recorded in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG). DSs can be classified into two types (DS1 and DS2), with DS2 linked to transient increases in arousal, brain-wide neural activation, and functional relevance for memory encoding. Despite growing interest in their physiological and functional properties, no standardized framework exists for detecting and classifying DSs. We present Toothy, an open-source tool for DS detection and classification in large-scale electrophysiological recordings. Toothy offers a modular and interactive workflow comprising three key steps: (1) ingestion and preprocessing of local field potential (LFP) recordings, (2) detection of hippocampal population events, and (3) classification of DS types using peri-event current source density (CSD) profiles. To support both flexibility and reproducibility, features include compatibility with multiple recording formats, customizable processing parameters, interactive event review tools, and comprehensive logging of event detection and classification parameters. In addition to DS detection, Toothy can also detect sharp wave-ripples (SPW-Rs; an oscillatory population event recorded in the CA1 region), enabling comparative analysis between DSs and SPW-Rs. Toothy provides a standardized, reproducible pipeline for DS detection and classification, advancing broader efforts towards investigating hippocampal dynamics across diverse settings.",
