      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Curious if this is just my experience or pretty common. In a lot of projects I\u2019ve touched, a big percentage of CI failures aren\u2019t actual logic bugs. They\u2019re things like: dependency updates breaking builds flaky tests lint/formatting failures misconfigured GitHub Actions / CI YAML caching issues missing or wrong env vars small config changes that suddenly block merges It often feels like a lot of time is spent just getting CI back to green rather than working on product features. For people who deal with CI regularly: What kinds of CI failures eat the most time for you? How often do you see failures that are basically repetitive / mechanical fixes? Does CI feel like a productivity booster for you, or more like a tax? Genuinely curious how widespread this is.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/According-Figure-829\"> /u/According-Figure-829 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qri8i7/how_much_time_do_you_actually_spend_fixing_ci/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qri8i7/how_much_time_do_you_actually_spend_fixing_ci/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "From Sensory Details to Verbal Codes: Visual Memory Reinstatement of Location and Color Features",
      "content": "Successful episodic memory depends on the reinstatement of encoding content and processes during retrieval. However, it remains unclear how such reinstatement (1) differs for various perceptual features, (2) supports subjective versus objective memory retrieval, and (3) relies on linguistic information. To investigate these three issues, we designed an fMRI study in which participants encoded and recalled the colors and spatial locations of object pictures, and provided subjective vividness and objective precision measures. We used encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) to identify feature-level reinstatement for location or color features, and trial-specific reinstatement for individual location trials or individual color trials. The study yielded three main findings. First, feature-level reinstatement in frontoparietal and visual regions supported both location and color memory, whereas trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex contributed to location memory and feature-level reinstatement in lateral/anterior temporal cortices, to color memory. Second, trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex supported both location vividness and precision, while feature-level reinstatement in inferior frontal gyrus contributed to color vividness, and trial-specific reinstatement in posterior inferior temporal gyrus (including the color area), to color precision. Finally, color name richness (the number of names associated with a particular color) enhanced color memory precision and modulated trial-specific color reinstatement in right anterior inferior temporal gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual and linguistic reinstatement play complementary roles in visual episodic memory: perceptual replay provides fine-grained sensory details, whereas linguistic replay can scaffold and refine these representations, especially for features that are easier to verbalize such as colors.",

      "title": "White Matter Lesion Asymmetry and Carotid Intraplaque Hemorrhage: A Novel Imaging Phenotype for Stroke Risk in Older Men",
      "content": "Background: While identifying high-risk carotid disease remains a significant clinical challenge, the specific role of carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is poorly understood. Although IPH has been linked to white matter lesion (WML) burden, current assessments overlook the directional impact of plaque instability on the brain. This study sought to determine whether IPH is an independent driver of asymmetric WML pathology and evaluate if this phenotype can identify a high-risk demographic for TIA and stroke. Methods: This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 264 participants (mean age 71.8 years) from the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (2010-2015). Participants underwent 3T MRI to assess carotid IPH and WMLs. We quantified WMLs using a deep-learning pipeline to extract three biomarkers: volume (WML-ICV), intensity (WML-Intensity), and intensity ratio (WML-IR). The Asymmetry Index Measure (AIM) defined the inter-hemispheric log-ratio, while the association between IPH and AIM was examined using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, stenosis, and scanner manufacturer. A secondary composite outcome of TIA/stroke was analyzed via logistic regression to evaluate the interaction between IPH, age, and sex. Results: While whole-brain WML burden did not significantly differ by IPH status (p > 0.60), IPH status was a robust independent predictor of hemispheric asymmetry (WML-ICV: p = 0.01; WML-Intensity, p = 0.01). Post-hoc analysis confirmed WML burden was significantly higher in IPH+ older males (=> 70 years) compared to younger cohorts (p < 0.04). This older male subgroup also demonstrated 4.57-fold higher adjusted odds of TIA/stroke (p = 0.02) compared to other demographic subgroups (all p > 0.87). Conclusions: Carotid IPH is independently associated with a rightward asymmetric WML phenotype not captured by global metrics. This imaging marker identifies a high-risk demographic of older males with a nearly five-fold increase in clinical events, suggesting that hemispheric-level analysis provides critical prognostic value for stroke risk stratification.",

      "title": "Single cell profiling reveals GSM-15606 attenuates air pollution-induced inflammation and preserves hippocampal neurogenesis",
      "content": "Introduction: Air pollution (AirPoll) is a major environmental risk factor for age-related cognitive decline and dementia, yet we poorly understood the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its effects and their potential attenuation. Methods: We combined single cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry to determine transcriptional responses in microglia, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells in the hippocampus of mice following exposure to chronic diesel exhaust particle (DEP). Differential gene expression profiles were compared between filtered-air and DEP exposed animals. The gamma secretase modulator GSM-15606 (BPN) was used to probe selective rescue of inflammatory signatures across distinct cell populations. Results: DEP exposure triggered robust inflammatory programs in microglia and astrocytes, including upregulation of cytokine signaling components, innate immune receptors, stress-responsive transcription factors, and markers of reactive glial phenotypes. In neural stem cells, DEP induced activation of gliosis-associated pathways, including Il6st, Stat3, and Txnip, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state that may bias lineage decisions. Immunostaining confirmed a significant reduction in immature neurons in the neurogenic niche after AirPoll exposure. GSM-15606 attenuated many DEP-induced transcriptional alterations in microglia and astrocytes, reducing expression of inflammatory mediators and reactive gliosis markers, but did not modulate the inflammatory profile of neural stem cells. Conclusions: AirPoll activates divergent inflammatory pathways across hippocampal cell populations and suppresses neurogenesis. Targeting inflammation with GSM-15606 selectively reverses glial but not neural stem cell responses, highlighting cell-type-specific mechanisms and potential therapeutic pathways to mitigate pollution-related cognitive vulnerability. These results support GSM-15606 as a protective agent against AirPoll-induced hippocampal dysfunction and amyloidogenic stress.",

These algorithms may be used to conveniently and efficiently estimate a given signal's Shannon entropy rate, a biologically relevant measure of the complexity of a signal. It is therefore natural to explore their effectiveness in the analysis of spiking neural data. Approach: This work focuses on using compression to analyze recordings (96-channel Utah arrays) taken from motor cortex of animals performing reaching tasks for three days before and three days after administering electrolytic lesions (Subject U: 4 lesions, H: 3). In particular, we use the inverse compression ratio (ICR), which compares the sizes of compressed and uncompressed data to estimate the amount of statistically unique information. We calculate ICR with temporally-independent lossless compression (gzip) and temporally-dependent lossy compression (H.264, MPEG-2). Compression-based ICR was compared to single-neuron measures used to understand spiking data, such as average firing rates and Fano factor. Compression is also compared to common dimensionality reduction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Main Results: Statistical tests on aggregate data comparing each metric before and after lesioning reveal that ICR is able to significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01) detect lesions with higher accuracy than single-neuron metrics, but not dimensionality reduction (ICR methods: 85.7%, single-neuron methods: 78.6%, dimensionality reduction: 100%). Additionally, statistical results on the same data show that ICR metrics remain more stable than single-neuron methods after lesion. The bitrate parameter of lossy compression algorithms is swept to better understand the effect of information rates and \"optimal\" compression on lesion detection performance. Our conclusions are confirmed by the same analyses performed on several different simulated neural datasets. Significance: These results suggest that compression algorithms may be a useful tool to detect and better understand perturbations to the underlying structure of neural data. Information-theoretic analyses may complement techniques like dimensionality reduction and firing rate tuning as a convenient and useful tool to characterize neural data.",

      "title": "A dual neural system supporting multi-tasking cognitive flexibility",
      "content": "One ubiquitous feature of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly switch between multiple tasks. Abstract task representations provide a basis for task learning, switching, and generalization, yet how the brain coordinates multiple task representations to support multitasking and task-switching remains poorly understood. We recorded functional MRI activity in human participants while they concurrently held multiple task rules in working memory and prioritized different rules for stimulus processing across trials. Our results reveal two distinct coding schemes for task prioritization. First, an active coding scheme supports the spatial separation of prioritized and unprioritized task rules: prioritized rules are represented across a distributed cortical network, whereas unprioritized rules are only found in the posterior cortex. Second, besides this active scheme, subregions of the default mode network, including the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, contribute to offloading task representations into an unprioritized state and subsequently maintain sustained representations of these rules across trials via latent neural codes. Behavioral predictions using on-task, trial-wise and sustained, block-wise representations further support the neural dissociation. These findings unveil a dual neural system with distinct coding schemes that jointly enable cognitive flexibility for task implementation and switching.",
