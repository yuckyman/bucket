      "title": "Proteome analysis reveals common players between the physiological neurodegeneration of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and the pathological neurodegeneration in humans",
      "content": "Tunicates, including ascidians, are recognized as the true 'sister group' of vertebrates and are emerging as models to study the development and degeneration of central nervous system (CNS). Ascidian larvae have the typical chordate body plan that includes a dorsal neural tube. During their metamorphosis, a deep tissue reorganization takes place, with some tissues that degenerate while others develop to become functional during the adult life. The larval CNS also degenerates and most neurons disappear, making room for the formation of adult CNS. The genome of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis has been sequenced and annotated, with several CNS specific genes that have been characterized, revealing specification mechanisms shared with humans. These features make ascidian metamorphosis a good model to study the mechanisms underlying physiological CNS degeneration and to compare them to the pathological conditions typical of neurodegenerative diseases. In order to shed light on the molecular determinants of C. intestinalis metamorphosis and neurodegeneration, we analyzed the proteome at three stages of development: swimming larva (SwL, Hotta stage 28), settled larva (SetL, Hotta stage 32) and metamorphosing larva (MetL, Hotta stage 34). A total of 405 modulated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry by comparing the three stages. Enrichment and network analysis showed the involvement of several processes/pathways, including autophagy and mTOR pathway, and actin cytoskeleton organization and remodeling among the most significant ones. This study elucidates molecular pathways underlying ascidian metamorphosis and highlights shared mechanisms between physiological neurodegeneration in ascidians and pathological neurodegeneration in humans.",

      "title": "Dietary Non-protein Amino Acid AZE as an Environmental Trigger Activating Latent Genetic Susceptibility in C9orf72-ALS Pathogenesis",
      "content": "In human disease, clinical manifestations are not always tightly correlated with genetic etiology. While the GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS, a subset of mutation carriers stays asymptomatic. The molecular mechanisms underlying this incomplete penetrance remain elusive. Here, we identify L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZE), a dietary non-protein amino acid, as a critical environmental risk factor capable of unmasking latent genetic susceptibility in C9orf72-ALS pathogenesis. Specifically, AZE disrupts the proteasome-mediated clearance of toxic poly-GA dipeptide repeats derived from G4C2 repeats, triggering pronounced neuroinflammation and motor defects in a C9orf72-ALS mouse model that otherwise exhibits minimal phenotypes. Notably, AZE is widely present in the food chain (particularly in sugar beet) and consistently detectable in the postmortem human brains. A significant positive correlation was observed between sugar beet consumption and the incidence of sporadic C9-ALS cases in European nations. Critically, dietary intake of sugar beet juice is sufficient to activate subclinical genetic susceptibility in C9orf72-ALS mice. These findings reveal a direct diet-gene interplay in governing C9orf72-ALS penetrance, and propose dietary restriction of AZE-rich foods as a tangible strategy for genetically susceptible individuals to potentially delay or mitigate this currently incurable disorder.",

      "content": "Postoperative pain remains a major clinical challenge, as inadequate management can delay functional recovery, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of chronic pain development. Opioid analgesics, while considered the gold standard for treating severe acute postoperative pain, are limited by adverse effects such as respiratory depression, dependence, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, the latter being a key driver of persistent postoperative pain. Lapatinib, originally developed as an anticancer therapy, has recently shown analgesic potential in both preclinical and clinical studies. Importantly, unlike opioids, lapatinib does not appear to activate central reward pathways, thereby minimizing the risk of dependence. Although its efficacy has been investigated in several chronic pain models, its role in acute postoperative pain and the associated inflammatory response has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrated that lapatinib exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vitro by suppressing proinflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, COX-2, MMP, chemokines, mPGES-1 and PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In a mouse model of postoperative pain, preoperative administration of lapatinib attenuated both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. These behavioral effects were accompanied by decreased proinflammatory mediator expression (TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, COX-2, and mPGES-1) and increased IL-10 levels in the injured paw tissue. Our findings highlight lapatinib as a promising candidate for repurposing as a novel analgesic for postoperative pain. Its targeted mechanism of action and lower potential for adverse effects compared with opioids support further investigation into its clinical utility in pain management.",
