      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "AAV-mediated CSNK2B gene replacement rescues ASD-relevant phenotypes and establishes EEG biomarkers for translation in Csnk2b haploinsufficient mice",
      "content": "De novo CSNK2B variants are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and early-onset epilepsy, yet in vivo therapeutic evidence and translatable biomarkers remain limited. We generated Csnk2b haploinsufficient (Csnk2b+/-) mice that recapitulate core clinical features: ASD-like social and cognitive deficits, heightened anxiety, spontaneous seizures, cortical and hippocampal structural compromise, and reduced PV-interneuron density with impaired cortical inhibition. Neonatal brain-wide AAV-PHP.eB-mediated CSNK2B replacement (hsyn or CAG promoters, retro-orbital P3) restored cortical/hippocampal structure, normalized neuronal numbers, prolonged survival, and ameliorated seizures and ASD-like behaviors with comparable efficacy across promoters. Critically, treatment also corrected quantitative EEG signatures that are directly deployable in human trials: theta and gamma band power were normalized, theta/gamma (and beta/gamma) ratios recovered, and inter-areal coherence and gamma-band effective connectivity were restored, indicating re-established excitation/inhibition balance and large-scale network coordination. These EEG endpoints constitute a compact, noninvasive biomarker panel of target engagement and physiological efficacy that can be harmonized with clinical EEG to support dose finding, early decision-making, and longitudinal monitoring in CSNK2B gene-therapy trials. Together, our data provide preclinical proof-of-concept that early AAV-mediated CSNK2B replacement is therapeutically effective and nominate band-limited EEG metrics as translational readouts to accelerate first-in-human studies for CSNK2B-linked neurodevelopmental disorders.",
