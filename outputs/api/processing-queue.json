      "title": "Mapping the circulating proteome across neurodegeneration: A harmonized, consortium-scale framework for uncovering molecular pathophysiology",
      "content": "Large-scale plasma proteomics offers unprecedented opportunities to investigate the systemic biology of neurodegeneration, yet technical heterogeneity, site-specific artifacts, and clinical confounding remain major barriers to reproducible discovery. Leveraging data from 13,733 individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and non-impaired controls in the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC), we present a scalable and generalizable analytical framework for harmonizing and interpreting consortium-scale proteomic datasets. Using a high-dimensional perturbation framework, we systematically benchmark five commonly used batch correction methods across a range of realistic confounding structures, including site-disease imbalance, nonlinear effects, and heteroskedasticity. Empirical Bayes modelling via limma consistently emerged as the most robust method, optimally balancing removal of site-related technical variance with retention of disease-relevant biological signal. On this harmonized foundation, we resolve neurodegenerative disease plasma signatures, including a shared immune-metabolic axis in AD and PD, neuromuscular disruption in ALS, and proteostatic imbalance in PD. Tissue and cell-type enrichment highlight widespread immune-endocrine involvement in AD and hematopoietic activation in PD. Demographically matched analyses nominate distinct, candidate biomarkers across diseases, including lipid, redox, and complement factors in AD, lysosomal and cytoskeletal proteins in PD, and muscle-derived markers in ALS. This study establishes a scalable analytical framework for integrating real-world proteomic data and provides a disease-resolved catalogue of circulating signatures to inform biomarker development and targeted intervention across neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "Reward-predictive cues can become attractive themselves due to incentive salience attribution. This manifests as persistent engagement with cues, known as sign-tracking. Cue-evoked phasic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) is critical for sign-tracking and cue-evoked reward craving, yet is also known to follow learning rules requiring outcome value updating. Would cue-evoked dopamine track incentive salience persistence, or change in accord with reward value alteration while failing to encode persistent behaviors? We assessed NAc dopamine activity using fiber photometry in sign-tracking rats during an omission task, in which physical cue interaction cancels reward. Animals adapted to reward loss while maintaining non-physical cue interaction reflective of persistent incentive salience. Cue-evoked dopamine remained unchanged during omission, mirroring robust incentive salience but not behavioral adaptations occurring with learning. In contrast, outcome-related dopamine reflected reward gain or loss. Therefore, cue-related dopamine encodes persistence of cue value, independent of outcome-related dopamine signals tracking reward occurrence.",

      "content": "Placebo analgesia is a well-established medical phenomenon with overlapping neural representations between humans and rodents, but the genetic contribution to this conserved neural circuitry remains unknown. Using functional brain imaging in 305 monozygotic and dizygotic twins, we quantified the heritability of neural activation in placebo analgesia brain circuity during evoked pain, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, brainstem and cerebellum, using the ACE model. Neural responses showed significant heritability, with additive genetics accounting for 21 to 49% of the variance (A = 0.21 to 0.49), indicating that genetics have a moderate effect on pain-evoked brain activity within the placebo analgesia circuitry. For the first time, our findings reveal a heritable component of the neural network supporting placebo analgesia. By linking genetic variations to neural responses in the placebo analgesia circuitry, this study bridges human and preclinical research and opens new ways for improving clinical trial methodology and tailoring pain therapies to individual genetic profiles.",

      "title": "Signatures of covert neuron loss in the local field potential of motor cortex",
      "content": "Background: Covert stroke is understudied despite occurring ten times for every symptomatic stroke and contributing to stroke's enormous global disease burden. For instance, it is unknown whether covert stroke replicates the peri-infarct neuroelectrophysiological frequency spectrum impact of symptomatic stroke. This motivated the use of our novel electrolytic lesioning platform to explore the spectral consequences of covert neuron loss. Methods: During a multi-month period of participation in an arm reaching task, neuron loss was induced via electrolytic lesions to the motor cortex of two large animals (U: n = 4; H: n = 7). Behavioral metrics were paired with spectrum estimates from local field potential recordings. These spectra were represented as bandpowers, aperiodic/periodic parameters, and decomposed time-frequency tensors. Lesion impact was assessed using nonparametric permutation tests of next-day effects and state space model parameters. Results: Task success rate was unaffected by lesions, but shifts in aperiodic structure reduced next-day {gamma} bandpower (30 - 100 Hz; U: -1.38V2, p < 1 x 10-3; H: -1.66V2, p = 0.001) while sensorimotor rhythms spanning 8 - 45 Hz ({Sigma}SMR) were amplified (Monkey U: 8.68V2, p < 1 x 10-3; Monkey H: 2.40V2, p = 0.004). Additionally, state space modeling showed that spectral perturbations to {gamma} and {Sigma}SMR outlasted any behavioral impact of the lesions (Monkey U: Behavior=1 d, {gamma} =2 d, {Sigma}SMR =2 d; Monkey H: Behavior=0 d, {gamma} =3 d, {Sigma}SMR =1 d). Finally, tensor decomposition revealed interpretable, animal-specific perturbations to time-frequency dynamics. Conclusion: Covert neuron loss induced multi-day spectral perturbations similar to those observed after symptomatic stroke. The neural spectrum is thus more sensitive to neuron loss than previously understood and could be responsive to neuron loss caused by covert stroke. This work also motivates the use of electrolytic lesions to bridge covert and symptomatic regimes of neuron loss, advancing our causal understanding of post-stroke interactions between spectrum and behavior.",

      "content": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is traditionally viewed as a brake on motor output. Challenging this model, we investigated its role in value-based decision-making by recording single-neuron activity from the primate STN during a choice task. Our findings reveal that the STN contains functionally distinct clusters of neurons and, contrary to its classical role, the vast majority of task-related neurons (approximately 89%) exhibited activity consistent with action facilitation. Two of the clusters contained facilitative neurons that increased their firing for rewarded choices, and critically, their response latency predicted saccadic reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis. Population-level analyses further demonstrated that these facilitative neurons robustly encode the upcoming choice. A smaller third cluster of neurons showed activity consistent with action suppression. These results indicate a dual function of the STN, suggesting it plays a predominant role in actively facilitating desired actions, rather than simply suppressing unwanted ones.",

      "content": "Purpose: We aimed to develop an innovative RF coil toolset for high resolution in vivo and ex vivo non-human primate neuroimaging applications at 10.5T MRI. The main goal was to improve our multimodal neural connectivity pipeline through the improved SNR, CNR, and spatial resolution that result from utilizing high-density RF coil arrays in combination with ultra-high field MRI. Methods: Two RF coil arrays, both comprising 8 transmit and 40 receive channels, were designed and built for in vivo and ex vivo NHP imaging at 10.5 T. Experimental data was collected on multiple in vivo and ex vivo specimens, showing the utility UHF MRI for NHP neuroscience. Results: Experimental results demonstrate uniform whole-brain coverage within both in vivo--which included the cerebellar, and spinal cord regions--and ex vivo specimens. High spatial resolutions (in vivo: 0.1x0.1x0.5 mm, ex vivo: 120 micron isotropic) were achieved, revealing detailed anatomical structures throughout. High temporal stability allowed for EPI and dMRI applications. Conclusion: An RF coil toolset comprising two 8ch transmit/40ch receive arrays was successfully designed for both in vivo and ex vivo NHP brain applications at 10.5 T. Both high-density RF coil arrays coupled with the SNR and CNR benefits available at UHF supported unmatched anatomical, functional, and diffusion applications at some of the highest spatial resolutions to date. Additionally, the combined capability of both in vivo and ex vivo MRI with the same brain specimen allows for tighter control for experimental-paradigm multistage studies examining translation between in vivo and ex vivo methodologies.",

      "content": "BackgroundOptimization of brain health is a focal point in medical science, yet data regarding measuring, improving, and preserving lifelong brain health are lacking. This void demands an objective, change-sensitive measure of brain health and proven strategies to strengthen brain performance. The BrainHealth Project addresses these key issues, drawing upon neuroplasticity evidence of persistent modifiability of brain function across the lifespan. This landmark study aims to (i) evaluate and refine multidimensional change indices of brain health, (ii) evaluate the impact of evidenced-based cognitive strategies and lifestyle interventions on improving/maintaining brain health, and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms associated with brain health gains/losses.MethodsThis quantitative, longitudinal, interventional, open-label, single-arm clinical trial aims to recruit 100,000 generally healthy adults ages 18\u2013100 and evaluate changes for 10 years or longer. Assessments, coaching, and training are conducted online through the secure BrainHealth Platform, allowing utilization tracking. The BrainHealth Index (BHI) \u2013 a multidimensional assessment \u2013 is offered at baseline and every 6 months. Participants have access to coaching every 3 months and continual access to self-paced trainings and resources. The primary outcome is the composite BrainHealth Index score and its empirically derived subdomain scores: Clarity (cognitive health), Connectedness (social health), and Emotional Balance (mental health). The BHI includes validated measures sensitive to change, including gains or losses associated with behavior change and integration of cognitive strategies into daily life. This Index contrasts with traditional assessments focused primarily on detecting cognitive decline or diagnosing pathological conditions, yet it, too, has been found to be sensitive to small incremental losses. The primary online training, SMART (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Tactics), is a strategy-based program validated with 25+ years of research. SMART promotes improvements in neural health, cognition, wellbeing, connectedness, and real-life function, previously reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statistical approaches focus on individual prediction using nonlinear models trained with large samples and on assessing mechanisms influencing gains or losses on brain health metrics.DiscussionThis research extends prior RCT evidence to a longitudinal, epidemiologic approach, leveraging digital health and machine learning tools to deliver a generalizable measure of longitudinal brain health and actionable ways to achieve precision brain health. By integrating advanced statistical methods and large-scale data, the BrainHealth Project aims to provide medicine and society with accurate, multidimensional, sensitive, and actionable ways to optimize brain health practices across the lifespan.",
