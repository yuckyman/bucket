      "title": "Non-uniform effects of remaining field spread on the estimation of M/EEG activity and connectivity between regions of interest",
      "content": "In M/EEG analyses, it is often convenient to extract time series of activity originating from the regions of interest (ROIs). However, due to the spread of electric and magnetic fields, M/EEG recordings capture activity from all sources within the brain. Commonly used approaches for the extraction of ROI activity only partially alleviate this problem, and field spread remains a challenge even at the level of ROI time series. Because of the remaining field spread (RFS), the extracted time series captures activity not only from the considered ROI but also from other regions (not necessarily neighboring ones). The amount of RFS can strongly affect the validity of interpretations: with more RFS, the extracted time series becomes less representative of the ROI. However, neither the amount nor the pattern of RFS is usually known. In this study, we apply the cross-talk function (CTF) to analyze contributions of all sources across the brain to the extracted ROI time series, thereby quantifying the degree of RFS. With CTF, we show that the effect of RFS on the extraction of ROI activity and on the estimation of inter-regional connectivity is highly non-uniform across the cortex. In particular, ROIs farther away from the recording sensors are more likely to capture activity and connectivity from other areas. Finally, we validate this observation in simulations and complement it by investigating spurious and ghost interactions in real data. Overall, our results illustrate how CTF can be used as a diagnostic tool to quantify the effects of RFS and to evaluate pipelines for the extraction of ROI activity.",

      "title": "Thermodynamics of consciousness: A non-invasive perturbational framework",
      "content": "The quest for reliable and objective measures of consciousness is critical in basic and clinical neuroscience. Across species, the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI) has emerged as a robust empirical marker by directly perturbing the brain, yet its underlying principles of physics are not fully understood. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a non-invasive framework based on generative whole-brain models of non-equilibrium brain dynamics. Using these models, we identified violations of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) in humans and rodents across wakefulness, anesthesia, and disorders of consciousness. Mirroring the patterns observed with PCI, we found decreased FDT violations in unresponsive disorders of consciousness and anesthesia compared to conscious conditions. This reveals a close link between PCI and non-equilibrium dynamics in spontaneous brain signals, grounding PCI in fundamental principles of physics. Overall, this framework offers new complementary, non-invasive, model-based avenues for understanding the nature of consciousness and for developing objective tools to assess its loss and recovery in health and disease. It also provides a principled foundation for discovering novel strategies to restore consciousness.",

      "title": "Distributed neural dynamics underlie the shift from movement preparation to execution",
      "content": "Dissociating the neural mechanisms of movement preparation from those of execution across the brain is fundamental to understanding motor control. Invasive recordings in primary motor cortex (M1) indicate that shared neural populations support both phases by unfolding within orthogonal subspaces or \"manifolds\", yet whether and how these dynamics evolve across the broader set of brain regions involved in memory-guided skilled action remains poorly understood. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) data obtained during a memory-guided delayed finger-sequence task to track fast population dynamics across M1, premotor cortices, and the hippocampus. Linear discriminant analysis decoding of sequence-specific preparatory and execution patterns revealed a transition from preparation to execution patterns across all regions prior to movement onset. Importantly, the onset of execution exhibited region-specific timing, with M1 shifting last, {approx} 100 ms before the first button press, consistent with the established cortical motor hierarchy. Low-dimensional trajectories showed that preparatory and execution states occupied distinct manifolds, yet were not fully orthogonal, suggesting partial overlap in tuning. MEG dynamics were dominated by peri-movement phase activity in primary motor and premotor regions. Nevertheless, above-chance sequence decoding was recoverable from all motor and premotor regions during execution, and in M1 during preparation. The state shift and the decoding accuracy was driven by distributed modulations across multiple frequency bands, indicating that full-band population dynamics carry richer information than band-limited features alone. These results demonstrate that non-invasive MEG can resolve continuous, hierarchical neural state transitions in the human brain in the context of memory-guided movement control. They offer mechanistic insight into distributed motor-related brain dynamics and support developing brain-computer-interfaces that incorporate signals from multiple brain regions beyond the primary motor cortex.",
