      "title": "Resting-state and task-related neurometabolite levels differentially relate to cortical excitability in the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Background. Normal brain function requires a dynamic balance between inhibition and excitation. While magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantifies the chief inhibitory and excitatory neurometabolites, GABA and glutamate-glutamine (Glx), the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) provides a complementary measure of cortical inhibition-excitation dynamics via transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs). However, the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs is unclear. Objective. To characterize the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs, as a function of TEP component, TMS pulse type, brain region, neurometabolite, and MRS brain state. Methods. Twenty-five young healthy adults completed a 4-day protocol. Sessions 1 and 2 involved screening, anatomical MRI, and functional MRI localization of DLPFC. In session 3, single- and paired-pulse TMS-EEG were applied over SM1 and DLPFC. Session 4 included resting-state and motor-task-related MRS of SM1 and DLPFC. Results. In SM1, task-related GABAergic tone strongly predicted early to mid-latency TEPs. In DLPFC, local early to mid-latency TEPs showed no relationship to neurometabolites, whereas late and global TEP outcomes revealed some links. The later N100 TEP was the only component consistently modulated by paired-pulse TMS. Task-related MRS measures consistently outperformed resting-state measures in predicting TEPs for SM1, while the opposite was true for DLPFC. Conclusions. Single-pulse TEPs reliably index the local inhibitory tone in SM1, with limited added value from paired-pulse paradigms. These findings support the use of single-pulse TEPs as accessible markers of cortical inhibition, especially for SM1, and may inform biomarkers and strategies for individualized neuromodulation.",

      "title": "Neonatal brain-age models in full- and preterm infants",
      "content": "Prematurity affects brain development and increases risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. Yet reliable biomarkers for at-risk infants remain limited. The goals of this study are (1a) to construct a white matter neonatal brain-age model including full-term and preterm neonates from a large publicly-available data set, (1b) to evaluate the accuracy of this model for characterizing the preterm brain from the same data set; (2) to determine if a similar model can predict brain-age based on clinical MRI scans from high-risk neonates born preterm; and (3) to evaluate whether this predictive model provides information about the infant's health beyond conventional clinical and demographic measures. We developed brain-age prediction models using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-derived white matter features from two datasets: (1) the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP; 368 healthy infants) and (2) a clinical sample collected at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH; 162 high-risk preterm infants). White matter features demonstrated strong predictive performance in the dHCP dataset (within 3.9 days) and the LPCH clinical dataset (within 6.6 days). However, brain-age metrics (i.e., brain-age gap) showed no significant associations with health complications measured by a composite score of common prematurity complications. While tractometry-derived brain-age models accurately characterize brain maturation in the neonatal brain, their sensitivity to clinical complications in preterm infants appears limited. Global white matter maturation measures derived from clinical grade data may be insufficiently sensitive to capture the cumulative burden of prematurity-related morbidities, suggesting need for multimodal or longitudinal biomarkers.",

      "content": "Neural decision-making flexibly integrates evidence across sensory, mnemonic, and semantic domains. Yet all prior demonstrations involve evidence that is either directly available in stimuli or retrieved from established representations. A fundamental question remains: does neural evidence accumulation extend to decisions based on evidence that must be computed through learned representational transformations? Here we show it does. We recorded scalp EEG while participants classified continuously-oriented visual stimuli into discrete categories defined by an experimenter-imposed boundary. Category-level evidence was operationalized as category coherence, or the angular distance between each stimulus and the learned boundary. We predicted that if neural decision mechanisms are truly domain-general, the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), a scalp EEG potential indexing evidence accumulation, should scale with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP sensitivity should correlate with computational drift rates. Both predictions were supported: CPP slopes increased monotonically with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP slopes correlated with individual differences in drift rates across participants. These findings reveal that the brain's decision machinery treats evidence identically regardless of its representational origin - whether externally available, pre-existing, or computed through learned transformations.",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.
