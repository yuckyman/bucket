      "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "title": "Characterization of aperiodic and theta activity in preterm infants using EEG: Insights into cerebral maturation and inter-individual variability",
      "content": "Preterm birth disrupts critical processes of brain development, impacting the maturation of brain structural organisation and functional activity. In early development, theta oscillations are thought to play a key role in supporting the formation and development of functional networks, but their maturation appears vulnerable to prematurity. Traditional EEG spectral analyses have indicated marked development of theta power in early infancy, but these approaches mix oscillatory and non-oscillatory activity, limiting insights into the mechanisms underlying the neural changes. Using spectral parametrisation, we aimed to evaluate developmental changes in aperiodic activity and periodic theta power in infants born very preterm compared to full-terms, and to further explore whether clinical factors and brain microstructure could explain the inter-individual variability within preterms. High-density EEG was acquired during active/REM sleep at term-equivalent age (TEA) and 2 months corrected age (2mCA) in 41 very preterm infants and 13 full-term controls. Spectral parameterization was used to extract aperiodic components (offset, exponent) and periodic theta power globally and across spatial clusters (anterior, central, posterior). From TEA to 2mCA, aperiodic offset and exponent, as well as theta power, increased with no differences between preterm and full-term infants. Cluster-based analyses revealed regional differences at each age and in their maturation over two months. At TEA, aperiodic metrics and theta power were stronger in anterior compared with posterior areas, but this regional landscape shifted by 2mCA for aperiodic metrics, driven by pronounced increases in aperiodic offset and exponent in posterior areas from TEA to 2mCA. Within preterms, inter-individual variability in aperiodic and periodic metrics at TEA was partly explained by clinical risk factors and variations in brain microstructure, as assessed with diffusion MRI at the same age. Male sex was characterised by lower theta power; lower gestational age at birth was associated with lower exponent; being small for gestational age was related to higher theta power, and invasive ventilation was linked to lower offset and exponent. Additionally, higher theta power correlated with lower cortical fractional anisotropy, consistent with more advanced cortical maturation. Collectively, these findings indicate that EEG spectral parameterization combined with spatial analysis provides a sensitive framework for characterising the postnatal maturation of brain activity in infants, as well as early vulnerabilities associated with prematurity and perinatal adversity.",

      "content": "Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by chronic worry and emotional dysregulation, yet its underlying white matter (WM) architecture remains inconsistent in previous neuroimaging studies. This study aimed to delineate microstructural WM alterations in GAD using ultra-high field (7T) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and advanced correlational tractography, evaluating their associations with symptom severity and diagnostic-aided value. Methods: Eighty-eight participants (27 GAD, 61 healthy controls, HCs) underwent 7T DTI scanning with 1.5-mm isotropic resolution. Whole-brain correlational tractography was applied to identify tracts exhibiting significant group-related differences in diffusion indices while controlling for demographic covariates. Associations with Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) scores were examined, and machine learning-based models were used to assess the diagnostic-aided utility of identified WM features. Results: Two tract bundles showed significant fractional anisotropy (FA) alterations in GAD: decreased FA in the right prefrontal pathway (P-FDR = 0.039) and increased FA in the right cingulum (P-FDR < 0.001). The anterior portions of both tracts exhibited stronger effects of GAD. FA in the right cingulum positively correlated with HAM-A and PSWQ scores, indicating that greater microstructural coherence was associated with higher anxiety and worry severity (both P-FDR < 0.001). Inclusion of WM features could improve classification performance beyond neuropsychological measures alone. Conclusions: Ultra-high field 7T tractometry revealed a differential pattern of WM abnormalities in GAD, suggesting weakened prefrontal control and hyper-integrated cingulate connectivity as structural correlates of emotional dysregulation. These findings indicate the potential of 7T DTI markers for advancing mechanistic and diagnostic understanding of GAD.",

      "title": "Bivalent habenula modulation of human monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways",
      "content": "The habenula is implicated in signaling negative reward prediction errors (RPE), yet direct causal evidence demonstrating its influence on downstream human brain circuits is limited. Using ultra-high field (7T) fMRI and dynamic causal modelling across two negative RPE-inducing experimental tasks, we characterize habenula-directed connectivity with monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways in healthy adults. Negative feedback drove strong habenula inhibition of ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe nucleus activity, while positive feedback had an excitatory effect. These core effects are replicated across reversal learning and perceptual decision uncertainty tasks, establishing a generalizable mechanism for behavioral adaptation. Task-specific modulatory effects emerged in pathways between the subcortical and cortical regions (ventral tegmental area[-&gt;]dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus[-&gt;]medial prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex[-&gt;]habenula), revealing context-dependent cortical elaboration of negative RPE-driven habenula signals. This provides the first evidence in humans for bivalent causal modulation of habenula function on monoaminergic midbrain and cortical pathways, demonstrating how the brain integrates negative and positive signals to guide adaptive behavior.",
