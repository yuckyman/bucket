      "content": "Background: Identifying the stimulation brain target is fundamental for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Currently, this process is time-consuming and heavily dependent on the operator s expertise. Objective: This study evaluated a deep learning based approach to structural brain connectivity for improving stimulation site prediction and real time cortical excitability mapping during neuronavigation. Results: Tractography derived connectivity features and distal myographic responses were used to train four neural network models across five subjects. Neural network inputs were incrementally varied using either tractography alone, coil coordinates alone, or hybrid combinations of both using different concatenation regimes. The best performance was observed in two subjects out of 5, where hybrid models integrating coil coordinates and fiber information achieved higher F1 scores and accuracy. Conclusion: Despite these promising results, substantial inter-subject variability was observed. This approach may also be applied to other brain regions to investigate connectivity, and the use of machine learning could be extended to functional domains beyond the motor cortex, including sensory and cognitive areas.",

      "title": "Behavioral Thermoceptive Responses and Morphologic Correlates in Mouse Models of CMT1A, HNPP and Aging",
      "content": "Background: Thermoceptive dysfunction is a frequent but understudied feature of peripheral neuropathies and aging. Patients often report abnormal heat perception, yet the underlying sensory mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluated thermoceptive behavior and corresponding structural changes in mouse models of inherited dysmyelinating neuropathy and natural aging to identify shared and divergent mechanisms. Methods: Thermal preference was assessed using a user-independent gradient apparatus spanning physiological to noxious temperatures, with automated quantification of time in zone, distance traveled, and velocity. Nocifensive responses were evaluated by hot plate latency. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) was measured in paw pads, and TRPV1-positive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal imaging. Results: Thermal gradient testing revealed preserved temperature preference in CMT1A and HNPP mice but significantly altered behavior in aged animals, which spent less time in warmer zones. Hot plate testing showed prolonged times to nocifensive behavior in aged and CMT1A mice, whereas HNPP mice exhibited variable responses. IENFD was markedly reduced in aged mice but preserved in CMT1A and HNPP. DRG analysis revealed smaller soma diameters and reduced proportions of TRPV1-positive A{delta} neurons in aged mice, while CMT1A animals maintained normal morphology. Interpretation: Aging produces thermoceptive deficits through axonal degeneration and selective A{delta}-fiber vulnerability, whereas CMT1A mice display conduction-related impairment due to dysmyelination. Both models reproduce key human sensory phenotypes and provide translational platforms for studying small-fiber dysfunction and therapeutic interventions in peripheral neuropathies.",

      "content": "Tractometry enables detailed mapping of white matter microstructure along individual tracts and is widely used to study disease effects such as those seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how different tractography algorithms influence tractometry outcomes remains unclear. Here, we compared whole-brain deterministic and probabilistic tractography using the BUndle ANalytics (BUAN) framework in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, including 118 AD and 728 cognitively normal (CN) participants. Both approaches revealed the expected pattern of lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean, radial, and axial diffusivity (MD, RD, AxD) in AD, consistent with white matter degeneration. Despite broadly similar global trends, substantial bundle-level differences emerged between the two tractography methods. Probabilistic tracking produced stronger and more spatially extended effects in the fornix, a small and highly curved limbic pathway vulnerable to AD-related degeneration, whereas deterministic tracking showed greater sensitivity in the posterior segments of the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF\\_R). These discrepancies highlight that the choice oftractography algorithm can alter detecting disease effects, emphasizing the need for cross-method validation to ensure the robustness and interpretability of along-tract measures.",

      "content": "Tractometry allows quantitative analysis of white matter microstructure along the brain's fiber tracts, but the impact of study design parameters- such as sample size and along-tract resolution- on sensitivity and specificity is not well understood. In this study, we conducted tractometry bootstrap analysis using linear-mixed models across four diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics to systematically evaluate how these factors affect the detection of dementia- and amyloid-related effects. While coarser along-tract segments yield greater sensitivity and higher mean effect sizes, finer segments tend to produce higher peak effect sizes, revealing more spatially localized effects. Dementia-related effects were more widespread and detectable with fewer subjects, whereas amyloid-related effects were more subtle and localized, requiring larger cohorts to detect them. These findings highlight that tractometry offers improved spatial specificity and can reliably detect small, fine-scale effects, but study design should be tailored to specific research questions, considering the expected spatial extent and magnitude of effects, to optimize sample size efficiency and interpretability.",

      "title": "Extracting task-relevant preserved dynamics from contrastive aligned neural recordings",
      "content": "Recent work indicates that low-dimensional dynamics of neural and behavioral data are often preserved across days and subjects. However, extracting these preserved dynamics remains challenging: high-dimensional neural population activity and the recorded neuron populations vary across recording sessions. While existing modeling tools can improve alignment between neural and behavioral data, they often operate on a per-subject basis or discretize behavior into categories, disrupting its natural continuity and failing to capture the underlying dynamics. We introduce Contrastive Aligned Neural DYnamics (CANDY), an end-to-end framework that aligns neural and behavioral data using rank-based contrastive learning, adapted for continuous behavioral variables, to project neural activity from different sessions onto a shared low-dimensional embedding space. CANDY fits a shared linear dynamical system to the aligned embeddings, enabling an interpretable model of the conserved temporal structure in the latent space. We validate CANDY on synthetic and real-world datasets spanning multiple species, behaviors, and recording modalities. Our results show that CANDY is able to learn aligned latent embeddings and preserved dynamics across neural recording sessions and subjects, and it achieves improved cross-session behavior decoding performance. We further show that the latent linear dynamical system generalizes to new sessions and subjects, achieving comparable or even superior behavior decoding performance to models trained from scratch. These advances enable robust cross-session behavioral decoding and offer a path towards identifying shared neural dynamics that underlie behavior across individuals and recording conditions. The code and two-photon imaging data of striatal neural activity that we acquired here are available at https://github.com/schnitzer-lab/CANDY-public.git.",

      "title": "Spinal electrophysiology reveals frequency-specific spatial patterns of neural activity and corticospinal coherence during pincer-grip",
      "content": "Background: Neural dynamics within sensory-motor networks involved in motor control exhibit well-established frequency-dependent patterns of cortical activity. In contrast, corresponding neural patterns of spinal cord activity remain poorly understood. As an active functional part of motor control, characterising spinal cord activity is essential for understanding sensorimotor function. High-density electrospinography presents a novel technique to assess spinal neural dynamics by non-invasively recording task-relevant electrical activity. Objective: To non-invasively investigate spatio-spectral patterns of task-related spinal activity and its functional connectivity with cortical regions during isometric pincer-grip contraction. Methodology: Here, we simultaneously recorded 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG), 64-channel electrospinography (ESG), and two bipolar electromyography (EMG) signals during an isometric pincer-grip task. We investigated frequency-specific spatial patterns of spinal activity and cortico-spinal connectivity by calculating task-related ESG power and cortico-spinal coherence between ESG and EEG signals during the isometric hold phase. Results: Distinct frequency-specific spatial patterns of spinal activity were observed at lower cervical levels during sustained hold, with significant activation over the ipsilateral anterolateral region. In the beta band, task-related spinal activity was significantly ipsilateralised, and exhibited significant cortico-spinal connectivity between contralateral motor cortex and ipsi-anterolateral spinal region. Conclusions: This first-of-its-kind application of HD non-invasive spinal electrophysiology revealed that the spinal cord exhibits distinct frequency-specific spatial activation and cortical connectivity patterns during pincer-grip sustained hold. Specifically, the ipsi-anterolateral spinal region demonstrated high task-relevance, potentially indicating anterior horn activity and its connectivity with motor cortex. Furthermore, beta-band activation was observed as a key signature during sustained hold, further underpinning its relevance during motor control.",

      "title": "Sleep arousals are associated with the polygenic risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and with cognitive decline in healthy late middle-aged individuals",
      "content": "Objective: Sleep disturbances are increasingly recognized as early features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. In that context, spontaneous arousals during sleep have been associated with the burden of Amyloid beta in the brain of healthy late middle-aged individuals. Whether the heterogeneity of arousals during sleep may be related to the genetic risk of developing AD in young adults is not established. Likewise, whether arousals may be associated with cognitive decline is not known. Here, we evaluated the association between arousals, the genetic risk for developing AD and cognitive performance and cognitive decline in healthy young and late-middle-aged individuals. Methods: We classified spontaneous arousals using in-lab EEG recordings of sleep in 453 younger individuals (22+/-2.7y; 49 women) and 87 late middle-aged individuals (59.3+/-5.3y; 59 women) based on their association with sleep stage transitions and changes in muscle tone. We examined the associations between arousal types and the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for AD, cognitive performance at baseline and, in late middle-aged individuals, cognitive decline over 2 and 7 years. Results: The prevalence of arousals associated with sleep stage transition was higher in late middle-aged vs. younger individuals. Among these arousals, those with and without muscle tone increases were, respectively, associated with lower and higher PRS for AD in late middle-aged but not in younger individuals. In the late middle-aged individuals, transition arousals associated with and without muscle tone increases were, respectively, correlated with better and worse attentional performance at baseline, and lower and larger memory decline over 2 or 7 years. Conclusion: The heterogeneity in spontaneous arousals during sleep may reflect their physiological intensity or underlying neural activation, and may indicate vulnerability to AD in late middle-aged individuals. The findings may contribute to identifying early markers of neurodegenerative risk.",

      "title": "Investigating the Effects of APOE Genotype on Intracellular Cholesterol and the Endolysosomal System in the Aging Mouse Brain",
      "content": "Individuals who possess the {epsilon}4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) are at a significantly increased risk for developing Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the precise reason for this association is not fully understood. Beyond its effects on amyloid and tau, APOE also influences fundamental cellular processes in the brain, including cholesterol trafficking between cells and within the endolysosomal system, which may be a critical component of the APOE4-associated vulnerability to AD. Here, we examined how APOE genotype, sex, and aging alter intracellular cholesterol processing and the endolysosomal system in the mouse brain. Using the novel cholesterol-binding probe D4H*-mCherry, we quantified intracellular cholesterol levels, the levels of early endosomes (Rab5), late endosomes (CD63), and lysosomes (LAMP1), and the colocalization of cholesterol with these endolysosomal compartments. This analysis was performed in the cortex, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex of young, middle-aged, and old APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 mice. Our analysis revealed region-specific changes in intracellular cholesterol and the endolysosomal system in response to aging, sex, and APOE genotype. Notably, young APOE4 mice showed reduced cholesterol within early and late endosomes, but increased lysosomal abundance, suggesting impaired cholesterol processing. These APOE4-specific effects were less apparent in older animals. These effects were strongly modified by sex, with female APOE4 mice exhibiting elevated lysosomal cholesterol in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex at old age, indicating sex-dependent susceptibility. Together, these results reveal that APOE genotype, age, and sex interact to influence endolysosomal cholesterol homeostasis, with female APOE4 mice showing the greatest dysregulation. These findings suggest that early and region-specific endolysosomal defects may contribute to the heightened AD risk associated with APOE4, particularly in females.",

      "title": "Sequence preparation is not always associated with a reaction time cost",
      "content": "The extent to which a sequence of movements is prepared before initiating the first movement is a longstanding question in motor neuroscience. The observation that reaction time (RT) increases for longer sequences has been used as evidence of sequence preparation; reflecting the additional demands of preparing multiple movements before initiating a sequential action. However, many processes contribute to RT, making it unclear whether the observed RT increases specifically reflect sequence preparation. For example, with longer sequences, participants face greater ambiguity in selecting their first movement in the sequence. Here, we test how much of the observed RT increases can be explained by the first-target ambiguity when reaching toward spatial targets. In our paradigm, we independently manipulate: (i) the number of future targets displayed, (ii) the number of targets to be acquired, and (iii) the spatial arrangement of the targets. This approach allows us to vary the demands of sequence preparation and first-target ambiguity, thereby enabling a direct assessment of their respective influence on RT. We report that RT increases with additional sequence elements but that this effect is fully explained by the ambiguity in selecting the first reach target. That is, sequence preparation causes no RT increase. In fact, when first-target ambiguity is eliminated, RT is constant across the number of displayed targets even though kinematic analysis reveals that participants have prepared a sequence. Together, these results indicate that preparing multiple reaches to spatial targets does not impose additional temporal costs relative to preparing a single reach.",
