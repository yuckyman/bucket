      "title": "Ultrastructural changes at auditory nerve synapses following moderate noise exposure",
      "content": "Moderate noise exposure is a common experience, yet its impact on central auditory synapses remains poorly understood. We study this issue at the first synapses in the central auditory pathway formed by auditory nerve afferents onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus, called endbulbs of Held. Non-traumatic noise exposure alters endbulb properties, decreasing the probability of vesicle release and enlarging the pool of releasable vesicles as assessed using electrophysiological methods and immunolabelling. These changes appear homeostatic, to maintain synaptic efficacy during periods of high activity. To identify structural changes underlying the larger vesicle pool, we used serial blockface electron microscopy of endbulbs from control and noise-exposed mice to quantitatively assess synaptic morphology. We observed no differences in the juxtapositional area between endbulbs and bushy cells, nor in the number or density of active zones and postsynaptic densities. Images of endbulb terminals were significantly darker after noise exposure, indicating an increase in the density of synaptic vesicles. These results suggest that moderate noise exposure induces an activity-dependent increase in presynaptic vesicle numbers, consistent with the observed physiological changes in neurotransmitter release. This work sets the stage for high-resolution studies to quantify docked and reserve vesicles.",

      "title": "Retrograde viral delivery of hyper-IL-6 activates Stat3 in corticospinal tract neurons but causes severe tremors and weight loss in adult mice",
      "content": "Cytokines in the IL-6 family can improve axon regeneration after nervous system injury, acting in part by stimulating Stat3 phosphorylation and pro-regenerative signaling in injured neurons. Hyper-IL-6 (hIL-6) is an engineered ligand with enhanced signaling properties, shown previously to stimulate axon growth even more effectively than native IL-6 family members. Here we tested a method of hIL-6 delivery based on injection of retrograde AAV to the cervical spinal cord of adult mice. This was envisioned as a first step toward a regenerative treatment after spinal cord injury based on widespread stimulation of descending projection neurons. We found, however, that animals treated with AAV2-retro-hIL-6 developed severe tremors and weight loss within days of injection and reached criteria for humane euthanasia within five to eleven days, depending on viral dose. Examination of the cortex showed a pronounced increase in Stat3 phosphorylation in corticospinal tract (CST) neurons in hIL-6 animals versus control, confirming effective retrograde signaling. Stat3 phosphorylation and evidence of microglial activation were detected in tissue surrounding CST cell bodies and along descending CST axons, revealing extensive cytokine signaling and microglial response associated with secreted hIL-6. These results confirm the ability of hIL-6 expression to activate Stat3 signaling in CST neurons but uncover the potential for severe negative effects that must inform any further development of hIL-6 as a pro-regenerative therapeutic.",

      "title": "Histone Demethylase KDM6B Promotes Postnatal Oligodendrocyte Development and Cortical Myelination",
      "content": "Myelination in the postnatal cortex requires epigenetic programs that activate oligodendrocyte gene networks. Here we show that the histone H3K27me3 demethylase KDM6B promotes this process in vivo. Conditional Kdm6b deletion (Kdm6b-cKO) in Emx1 dorsal telencephalic progenitors caused delayed cortical myelination. Lineage-specific RNA-seq revealed that the oligodendrocyte master regulator Sox10 was significantly reduced, as well as myelination effectors, indicating impaired oligodendrocyte maturation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the same lineage showed increased H3K27me3 at promoter-proximal regions of Sox10, consistent with loss of KDM6B-mediated de-repression. Temporally controlled Sox10 induction partially rescued myelination in Kdm6b-cKO mice. These findings define a KDM6B[-&gt;]SOX10 axis that licenses oligodendrocyte development and cortical myelination by removing repressive H3K27me3 and sustaining active chromatin, with implications for KDM6B-related neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage has distinct effects on myelinated axons in the fimbria and on behaviors related to neurodevelopmental disorders in mice.",
      "content": "The hemizygous deletion of human chromosome 22q11.2 leads to cognitive and social deficits, as well as psychiatric disorders. Constitutive deletion of Tbx1, a T-box transcription factor gene encoded within this chromosomal region, results in deficits in various cognitive and social behaviors and altered formation of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and myelinated axons in the fimbria of adult mice. Given that Tbx1 is present in neonatal stem cells and oligodendrocytes, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage contributes to behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and ultrastructural changes in myelinated axons in the fimbria. To this end, we conditionally induced Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage in PdgfrCre;Tbx1+/flox mice. This mouse line showed recombination in brain regions known to express Pdgfra. Male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice performed better in spontaneous alternation in a T-maze than wild-type littermates at 1, but not 2 months of age; otherwise, mutant and wild-type littermates were indistinguishable in neonatal ultrasonic vocalization, peripubertal and postpubertal social interaction, novel object approach, anxiety-related behaviors in an elevated plus maze, and motor activity and thigmotaxis in an inescapable open field. The fimbria of male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice showed an increase in the number of myelinated axons in a range between 300 nm and 800 nm diameter and a decrease in the myelinated axons around 1,200 nm and 1,400 nm; the thickness of myelin was unchanged across all diameters. Our findings show that Tbx1 heterozygosity in oligodendrocyte precursor cells or their progeny selectively improves spontaneous alternation and shifts the proportion of myelinated axons toward small- to medium-sized axons, suggesting that the compositional shift in axons in the fimbria induced by Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage might underlie improved cognition relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Cell-type-specific adaptations to mitochondrial stress underly the neurological presentations of \tMTRFR mutations",
      "content": "Mitochondrial diseases are a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders that exhibit striking tissue specificity. Neurological involvement is among the most consistent features, yet the mechanisms that determine why selective neuronal populations are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. Mutations in MTRFR, a mitochondrial ribosome rescue factor, cause a progressive neuromuscular phenotype, but no relevant disease model exists to explain its cell-type-specific pathology. Here, we established the first human iPSC-derived neuronal model of MTRFR loss and identified mechanisms driving differential vulnerability between cortical and motor neurons. Although knockdown led to comparable deficits in mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS across both subtypes, cortical neurons engaged adaptive programs, including dendritic mitochondrial remodeling and heat-shock response activation, that preserved survival. Motor neurons failed to mount these responses and instead displayed apoptotic and inflammatory priming. Pharmacological enhancement of stress adaptation rescued motor neuron survival, indicating that resilience is programmable. These findings provide the first mechanistic evidence that neuronal susceptibility to mitochondrial translation defects is defined by the capacity to activate mitochondrial and cytoprotective stress-response pathways.",

      "title": "Multi-modal choroid plexus pathology in aging and Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Brain barriers, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, and peripheral factors are implicated as significant contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The choroid plexus (ChP) is a blood-brain interface that produces CSF and forms the blood-CSF barrier. However, how ChP pathology develops across the lifespan and contributes to AD has not been systematically characterized. Here, we report a multi-modal ChP atlas integrating single-nucleus transcriptomics from 49 individuals, AI-assisted quantitative histopathology across >500 postmortem samples age 16 to 105, spatial transcriptomics, and functional studies in 5xFAD mice. We identify fibrosis, calcification, and macrophage abnormalities as hallmarks of ChP aging, with AD pathology conferring additional effects, including expansion of a pro-inflammatory fibroblast-macrophage signaling niche. In 5xFAD mice, macrophage dysfunction is associated with impaired epithelial barrier maintenance and repair. Together, these data provide a foundational resource for understanding ChP dysfunction in aging and AD and propose the macrophage-fibroblast-epithelial barrier axis as a driver of ChP pathology.",
