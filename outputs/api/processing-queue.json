      "content": "<p>Interoception, the perception and integration of physiological signals, is a fundamental aspect of self-awareness and homeostasis. While previous work has explored interoceptive processing in the cardiac system, research in the respiratory domain, particularly in relation to brain structure and function, is limited. To address this gap, we utilized a Bayesian psychophysical model to quantify perceptual, metacognitive, and affective dimensions of respiratory interoception in a sample of over 200 healthy participants of both genders. Hierarchical modeling revealed that respiratory metacognition was associated with higher somatic and lower cognitive anxiety, respectively. Whole-brain microstructural indices of myelin content and cortical iron were measured using quantitative brain imaging. Whole-brain voxel-based quantification revealed distinct microstructural patterns in the insular, cingulate, and primary sensory cortices that underlie interoceptive sensitivity and precision. Myelination in the cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray was associated with confidence bias, while metacognitive sensitivity correlated with myelination in the midline prefrontal cortex. Our findings highlight key brain pathways involved in respiratory interoception and its perceptual, metacognitive, and emotional dimensions.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Adaptive behavior relies on prioritizing relevant sensory information, and decades of research have shown that current task goals and stimulus saliency influence this prioritization. Recent behavioral work indicates that incidental experience with frequently relevant locations or nonspatial features also shapes behavioral prioritization. The present study investigates the neural processing stages affected by incidental learning of nonspatial visual features. We recorded neural activity with high temporal resolution using electroencephalography while human participants (female and male) searched for visual targets that had predictable features (i.e., that appeared more frequently in a particular color). We found that incidental learning of the statistical structure was accompanied by an early differentiation of neural activity for relevant compared with irrelevant features beginning at ~120&nbsp;ms post stimulus onset, followed by an earlier-onset selection of the target item, as indexed by a latency shift of the N2pc (~200&nbsp;ms), and changes in later memory and response-related processes, marked by amplitude modulations of the LPC (&gt;400&nbsp;ms). Importantly, the magnitude of the effects across all three neural measures strongly tracked individual differences in the behavioral benefits of learned prioritization, suggesting that successful learning of feature regularities depends on modulating the flow of information across multiple processing stages.</p>",

      "content": "<p>GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) are an important building block in neural activity. Despite their widely hypothesized role in many basic neuronal functions and mental disorder symptomatology, there is a lack of biophysically and biochemically detailed models of these receptors and the way they mediate neuronal inhibition. Here, we developed a computational model for the activation of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs and its effects on the activation of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels as well as inhibition of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. To ensure the generality of our modeling framework, we fit our model to electrophysiological data including patch-clamp and intracellular recordings that described both pre- and postsynaptic effects of the receptor activation. We validated our model using data on postsynaptic effects of GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs on layer V pyramidal cell firing activity ex vivo and in vivo and confirmed the strong impact of dendritic GIRK channel activation on the neuron output. Finally, we reproduced and dissected the effects of a knockout of RGS7 (a G protein signaling protein) on CA1 pyramidal cell electrophysiological properties, which shows the potential of our model in generating insights on genetic manipulations of the GABA<sub>B</sub>R system and related genetic variants. Our model thus provides a flexible tool for biochemically and biophysically detailed simulations of different aspects of GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation that can reveal both foundational principles of neuronal dynamics and brain disorder-associated traits and treatment options.</p>",

      "title": "Adaptation of motor control strategies and physiological arousal during repeated blocks of split-belt walking",
      "content": "Physiological arousal, mediated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS), is known to co-modulate with adaptation of motor control strategies, governed by the central nervous system (CNS), in response to repeated standing perturbations. However, adaptation of the ANS physiological arousal response during repeat exposure to walking challenges remains unknown. This study examines the physiological arousal response (electrodermal activation, EDA) and motor control strategy of gait during a single session of repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking. Twenty young adults completed three repeated blocks (3.5 min each) of split-belt walking (2:1 speed ratio) alternating with three blocks of tied-belt walking. Step length symmetry (SLS), EDA, bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscle activation and ground reaction forces (GRFs) were measured. For each walking block, the first (early) and last (late) 15 strides were analyzed. A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) tested the effect of repeated blocks and phases (early/late) on SLS. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) examined patterns of within-block changes in EDA, muscle activation, and GRFs. The greatest within-block adaptation of SLS occurred during first exposure to split-belt walking (S1; p<.001). Similarly, the largest magnitude of within-block adaptation in muscle activation, GRFs, and EDA occurred during S1 (p<.05). Attenuated EDA responses together with lower magnitude of motor adaptation in subsequent split blocks 2 and 3 were observed, indicating savings across the ANS and CNS. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the ANS-mediated physiological arousal response modulates alongside the CNS-driven locomotor adaptation to repeated exposure to blocks of split-belt walking.",

      "title": "Trial-by-trial fluctuations in decision criterion shape confidence",
      "content": "Many of the choices we make are accompanied by a sense of confidence. Within classical Signal Detection Theory (SDT), confidence is conceptualized as the absolute distance between a decision variable and a decision criterion. The decision criterion is traditionally modelled as being stable over an experimental session. However, recent work challenges the notion of a static decision criterion, suggesting instead that the criterion undergoes trial-by-trial fluctuations. Combining SDT theory and model simulations, we predict that fluctuations in the decision criterion shape confidence. In 15 human decision-making datasets, trial-by-trial estimates of decision criterion were obtained with the Hierarchical Model for Fluctuations in Criterion (hMFC). Across all datasets, we confirmed our pre-registered hypothesis that confidence is shaped by single-trial criterion state. This effect was found in 14 out of 15 individual datasets, indicating a robust pattern across a variety of task paradigms and confidence reporting scales. Going beyond self-report, the shaping of confidence by criterion fluctuations was replicated in an implicit measure of confidence, RTs, and in two key neurophysiological markers, pupil-linked arousal and a neural signature of confidence. Our results demonstrate that variability in confidence, which has traditionally been treated as noise, actually reflects genuine sensitivity to the current state of the (fluctuating) decision criterion.",

      "content": "Innate behaviors are hardwired into the nervous system, allowing animals to produce them instinctively and without prior learning. This includes social behaviors (e.g., aggression, courtship) in most animals. If and how learning shapes such innate behaviors has not been systematically explored. Here, we investigate learning from social feedback in Drosophila. We use closed-loop optogenetics to systematically perturb the social experience of individual flies during courtship, and find that altered feedback changes the male fly's innate courtship strategy, opening the door for investigating the neural and molecular basis of social plasticity in flies.",

      "title": "REST/NRSF phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates its transcriptional repressor activity and half-life",
      "content": "REST is a repressor of a large cluster of neural genes containing RE1 motifs. In neurons, REST homeostatically regulates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, However, whether REST can be regulated by Ca2+ and Ca2+-activated kinases is unknown. Here, we investigated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) as upstream regulators of REST fate and activity. We show that REST is phosphorylated by CaMKIV at a main Ser-322 site located within the linker between the 5th and the 6th N-terminal Zn-finger domains. Phosphomimic REST mutant in Serine-322 decreased REST repressor activity and caused its transition from nucleus to cytosol, followed by degradation. Molecular dynamics simulations of the phosphomimic N-terminal REST and the DNA RE1 sequence revealed a sharp decrease in the stability of the REST-RE1 binding interface. Moreover, the homeostatic effects of CaMKIV on the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents were inhibited by the genetic deletion of REST. The results demonstrate that REST phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates the repressor activity of REST on neural genes and has a crucial role in the homeostatic regulation of REST levels.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Impact of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on cognitive flexibility as a function of task complexity",
      "content": "PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on cognitive flexibility under different levels of task complexity. The hypothesis was that taVNS would enhance cognitive flexibility more effectively under demanding task conditions.MethodA within-subject design was used, involving 24 healthy adults who completed a Dimensional Change Card Sorting task combined with an auditory task of varying difficulty levels (low, medium, high). Participants underwent both active and sham taVNS conditions while performing the tasks. The complexity of the auditory task served to reduce cognitive resources available for the cognitive flexibility task, allowing an assessment of how taVNS modulates cognitive flexibility under different task difficulty conditions.ResultsThe results show that switch costs in the Dimensional Change Card Sorting task increase with task difficulty. In addition, active taVNS reduced switch costs significantly in the high complexity condition, while no differences were observed in the low and medium complexity conditions. This indicates that taVNS is particularly effective in conditions of higher cognitive demand.ConclusionThe findings suggest that taVNS enhances cognitive flexibility, especially in more complex tasks, providing a better understanding of the effects of taVNS on cognitive control.",

      "title": "The slowest timescales of neural synchronization reveal the strongest influence of auditory distraction",
      "content": "IntroductionAmong all the sounds occurring at any given time, people are often interested in listening to just one. Some competing sounds are merely background noise, whereas others distract attention from target sounds and are less easily suppressed. During active listening, the central auditory pathway unmixes target and distractor sounds based on temporal differences across three orders of magnitude \u2013 from millisecond differences in acoustic temporal fine structure to slower perceptual grouping factors that stretch out to multiple seconds. We developed an approach to directly measure central auditory encoding of multiplexed target and distractor sound features in human listeners to determine which timescales are most impacted by the presence of distracting sounds.MethodsTarget sounds contained nested features along four timescales, including temporal fine structure (~500 Hz), temporal envelope (~25\u201380 Hz), envelope changes (~7 Hz), and slower changes reflecting whether target stimuli were randomly arranged or formed a repeating pattern (~0.5 Hz). Targets were presented with competing sounds that provided variable distraction levels: either a highly distracting melody or a less distracting noise. Neural synchronization to each timescale was simultaneously measured for target and distractor sounds from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during a listening task.ResultsSustained shifts from random to regular sequence arrangements were reliably perceived, yet did not evoke a pattern recognition potential, nor neural synchronization changes at any timescale. Synchronization to relatively slow changes in envelope transitions of the target sound deteriorated with the addition of more distracting sounds while synchronization to more rapid fluctuations in the fine structure or envelope were unaffected by varying distraction level. Categorizing trials by task performance revealed a conjunction of enhanced entrainment to slower temporal features in the distractor sound and reduced synchronization to the target sound on error trials.DiscussionBy designing a stimulus paradigm that leveraged the temporal processing capabilities of the auditory nervous system, we were able to simultaneously quantify multiple target and distractor sound features reproduced in the EEG. This paradigm identified synchronization processes which may prove valuable for research on clinical populations who report difficulty suppressing awareness of distracting sounds.",
