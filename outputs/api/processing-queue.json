      "title": "Uncovering Patterns of Brain Activity from EEG Data Consistently Associated with Cybersickness Using Neural Network Interpretability Maps",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20620v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cybersickness poses a serious challenge for users of virtual reality (VR) technology. Consequently, there has been significant effort to track its occurrence during VR use with brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG). However, a significant confound in current methods for detecting sickness from EEG is they do not account for the simultaneous processing of the sickening visual stimulus that is present in the brain data from VR. Using event-related potentials (ERPs) from an auditory stimulus shown to reflect cybersickness impacts, we can more precisely target EEG cybersickness features and use those to achieve better performance in online cybersickness classification. In this article, we introduce a method utilizing trained convolutional neural networks and transformer models and plot interpretability maps from integrated gradients and class activation to give a visual representation of what the model determined was most useful in sickness classification from an EEG dataset consisting of ERPs recorded during the elicitation of cybersickness. Across 12 runs of our method with three different neural networks, the models consistently pointed to a surprising finding: that amplitudes recorded at an electrode placed on the scalp near the left prefrontal cortex were important in the classification of cybersickness. These results help clarify a hidden pattern in other related research and point to exciting opportunities for future investigation: that this scalp location could be used as a tagged feature for better real-time cybersickness classification with EEG.

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Medically uncontrolled epileptic seizures affect nearly 15 million people worldwide, resulting in enormous economic and psychological burdens. Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\\%$ average). These findings highlight the potential of fractional dynamics to characterize seizure-related brain states and demonstrate its capability to suppress epileptic activity.",

      "title": "EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions",
      "content": "arXiv:2507.11783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Premise. Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubrics for long-term research progress remain unclear. Objective. In this work, we conduct a review of ten early EEG-FMs to capture common trends and identify key directions for future development of EEG-FMs. Methods. We comparatively analyze each EEG-FM using three fundamental pillars of foundation modeling, namely the representation of input data, self-supervised modeling, and the evaluation strategy. Based on this analysis, we present a critical synthesis of EEG-FM methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. Results. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked temporal EEG sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. Significance. Our review indicates that the development of benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.",

      "content": "arXiv:2412.07327v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Computational neuroscience relies on large-scale dynamical-systems models of neurons, with a vast amount of offline, pre-simulation, tuned parameters, with models often tied to their brain simulators. These fixed parameters lead to stiff models, that show unnatural behaviour when introduced to new environments, or when combined into larger networks. In contrast to offline tuning, in biology, cells continuously adapt via homeostatic plasticity to stay in desired dynamical regimes. In this work, we aim to introduce such online tuning of cellular parameters into brain simulation. We show that the sensitivity equation of a biorealistic neural models has the same shape as a general neuron model, and can be simulated within existing brain simulators. Via co-simulation with the sensitivity equation, we enable both offline, and online tuning of activity of arbitrary biophysically realistic brain models. Furthermore, we show that this opens the possibility to study the biological mechanisms underlying homeostatic plasticity, via both meta-learning plasticity mechanism as well as treating online tuning as a black-box plasticity mechanism. Through the generality of our methods, we hope that more computational science fields can capitalize on the similarity between the simulated model and its gradient system.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.21129v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This technical note considers the sampling of outcomes that provide the greatest amount of information about the structure of underlying world models. This generalisation furnishes a principled approach to structure learning under a plausible set of generative models or hypotheses. In active inference, policies - i.e., combinations of actions - are selected based on their expected free energy, which comprises expected information gain and value. Information gain corresponds to the KL divergence between predictive posteriors with, and without, the consequences of action. Posteriors over models can be evaluated quickly and efficiently using Bayesian Model Reduction, based upon accumulated posterior beliefs about model parameters. The ensuing information gain can then be used to select actions that disambiguate among alternative models, in the spirit of optimal experimental design. We illustrate this kind of active selection or reasoning using partially observed discrete models; namely, a 'three-ball' paradigm used previously to describe artificial insight and 'aha moments' via (synthetic) introspection or sleep. We focus on the sample efficiency afforded by seeking outcomes that resolve the greatest uncertainty about the world model, under which outcomes are generated.",

We present a machine learning framework for decoding neural (EEG) responses to dynamic visual language stimuli in Deaf signers. Using coherence between neural signals and optical flow-derived motion features, we construct spatiotemporal representations of predictive neural dynamics. Through entropy-based feature selection, we identify frequency-specific neural signatures that differentiate interpretable linguistic input from linguistically disrupted (time-reversed) stimuli. Our results reveal distributed left-hemispheric and frontal low-frequency coherence as key features in language comprehension, with experience-dependent neural signatures correlating with age. This work demonstrates a novel multimodal approach for probing experience-driven generative models of perception in the brain.",

      "title": "Brain-body dynamics is asymmetric and stable across cognitive states",
      "content": "The human body displays slow, spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity, autonomic physiology, and small incidental movements. It is unknown whether these co-fluctuations reflect a stable endogenous brain-body dynamic, or whether this dynamics varies with cognitive state. We addressed this question using a dynamical systems approach to analyze simultaneously recorded neural activity (EEG), autonomic physiology, and behavior while participants listened to spoken narratives or were at rest. We found that cognitive state did not substantially alter the endogenous dynamic. Acoustic and linguistic features predicted neural activity, which in turn affected physiological responses. Only low-level sound fluctuations exerted direct effects on autonomic signals. Peripheral physiology and behavior exerted stronger influences on EEG than the reverse. These findings suggest that slow co-fluctuations are the result of a stable brain-body dynamic with strong bottom-up feedback, and that the narrative entrains this dynamic by engaging cognition.",

      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.20847v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper introduces the YCB-Handovers dataset, capturing motion data of 2771 human-human handovers with varying object weights. The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation. Some objects also require careful handovers, highlighting contrasts with standard handovers. We also provide a detailed analysis of the object's weight impact on the human reaching motion in these handovers.",

      "title": "From Pilots to Practices: A Scoping Review of GenAI-Enabled Personalization in Computer Science Education",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20714v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.",

      "title": "Signal, Noise, and Burnout: A Human-Information Interaction Analysis of Voter Verification in a High-Volatility Environment",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20679v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election unfolded within an information environment of unprecedented volatility, challenging citizens to navigate a torrent of rapidly evolving, often contradictory information while determining what to believe. This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a \"leveling\" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone.",

      "title": "Learning Factors in AI-Augmented Education: A Comparative Study of Middle and High School Students",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.21246v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.",
