      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

If all goes well, we'll release pandas 3.0.0 in a few weeks.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li>Release candidate: <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/releases/tag/v3.0.0rc0\">https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/releases/tag/v3.0.0rc0</a></li> <li>Full release notes: <a href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html\">https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v3.0.0.html</a></li> <li>Tracking issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57064\">https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/57064</a></li> </ul> <p>A very concise, incomplete list of changes:</p> <h4>String Data Type by Default</h4> <p>Previously, pandas represented text columns using NumPy's generic &quot;object&quot; dtype. Starting with pandas 3.0, string columns now use a dedicated &quot;str&quot; dtype (backed by PyArrow when available). This means:</p> <ul> <li>String columns are inferred as dtype &quot;str&quot; instead of &quot;object&quot;</li> <li>The str dtype only holds strings or missing values (stricter than object)</li> <li>Missing values are always NaN with consistent semantics</li> <li>Better performance and memory efficiency</li> </ul> <h4>Copy-on-Write Behavior</h4> <p>All indexing operations now consistently behave as if they return copies. This eliminates the confusing &quot;view vs copy&quot; distinction from earlier versions:</p> <ul> <li>Any subset of a DataFrame or Series always behaves like a copy</li> <li>The only way to modify an object is to directly modify that object itself</li> <li>&quot;Chained assignment&quot; no longer works (and the SettingWithCopyWarning is removed)</li> <li>Under the hood, pandas uses views for performance but copies when needed</li> </ul> <h4>Python and Dependency Updates</h4> <ul> <li>Minimum Python version: 3.11</li> <li>Minimum NumPy version: 1.26.0</li> <li>pytz is now optional (uses zoneinfo from standard library by default)</li> <li>Many optional dependencies updated to recent versions</li> </ul> <h4>Datetime Resolution Inference</h4> <p>When creating datetime objects from strings or Python datetime objects, pandas now infers the appropriate time resolution (seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds) instead of always defaulting to nanoseconds. This matches the behavior of scalar Timestamp objects.</p> <h4>Offset Aliases Renamed</h4> <p>Frequency aliases have been updated for clarity:</p> <ul> <li>&quot;M&quot; \u2192 &quot;ME&quot; (MonthEnd)</li> <li>&quot;Q&quot; \u2192 &quot;QE&quot; (QuarterEnd)</li> <li>&quot;Y&quot; \u2192 &quot;YE&quot; (YearEnd)</li> <li>Similar changes for business variants</li> </ul> <h4>Deprecation Policy Changes</h4> <p>Pandas now uses a 3-stage deprecation policy: DeprecationWarning initially, then FutureWarning in the last minor version before removal, and finally removal in the next major release. This gives downstream packages more time to adapt.</p> <h4>Notable Removals</h4> <p>Many previously deprecated features have been removed, including:</p> <ul> <li>DataFrame.applymap (use map instead)</li> <li>Series.view and Series.ravel</li> <li>Automatic dtype inference in various contexts</li> <li>Support for Python 2 pickle files</li> <li>ArrayManager</li> <li>Various deprecated parameters across multiple methods</li> </ul> <p>Install with:</p> <p><code>Python pip install --upgrade --pre pandas </code></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Balance-\"> /u/Balance- </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdb5u2/pandas_30_release_candidate_tagged/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdb5u2/pandas_30_release_candidate_tagged/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Directed cortico-limbic dialogue in the human brain",
      "content": "How can one trace the brain's orderly directed signals amid a tangle of nerve fibers? Because direct access to actual brain signaling is rare in humans, the precise wiring diagrams for cortico-limbic communication during sleep and wake remain essentially unmapped, hampering progress in neuroscience. Now, a unique neurosurgical window on the human brain allows for electrically mapping cortical connections at the hospital, but studies so far have relied on average signals, masking the dynamic nature of signal flow across brain regions. To causally estimate signaling dynamics, we repeatedly probed cortico-limbic networks with short-lived electrical pulses over days and assessed the variable fate of each transmitted signal on a single-trial basis. In the resulting openly available dataset, we characterized signaling probabilities and directionality across thousands local and long-range cortico-limbic connections over days. Challenging established views, we found that limbic structures send twice as many signals as they receive, in both wakefulness and sleep. Our findings provide a fundamental framework for causally interpreting signal flow in the brain and formulating therapeutic strategies for brain networks disorders.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Category learning disentangles representation of trial events in hippocampus CA1",
      "content": "The hippocampus (HC) is known to encode task-relevant variables, including latent ones, capturing and parsing critical information from sequences into episodes. This is thought to be the basis to form a cognitive map of possible abstract states beyond mere perceptual details, akin a state machine, with predictive value, contributing to an internal world model. However, its specific role in categorization tasks in general, where learning a category may depend on independent, unordered (non sequential) experienced examples, remains unclear. Here, we investigate CA1 population coding during a categorization paradigm in mice in combination with calcium imaging at different stages of category training with interleaved generalization tests. Our results reveal that hippocampal coding changes critically throughout the different stages of categorization training. Specifically, the disentangling of choice and outcome variables emerges as factorized, abstract, representations and fundamentally distinguishes simple discrimination from categorization training. Furthermore, this factorized geometry relates to improved behavioral performance. Our findings suggest that trial encoding on HC adapts in response to the category structure presented by representing critical events into the appropriate computational format to support generalization of category membership.",
