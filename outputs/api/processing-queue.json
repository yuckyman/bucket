      "title": "Assistive Trajectory Planning for Lower Limb Exoskeletons: Strategies From Laboratory-Optimized Gait to Environmentally-Adaptive Locomotion Through Multimodal Parameter Awareness",
      "content": "Lower limb assistive exoskeletons (LLEs) show great potential to reduce metabolic cost, improve walking performance, and correct abnormal gait patterns. Among their core control architectures, assistive trajectory planning is key to determining system responsiveness and effectiveness under varying locomotion conditions. Many trajectory planning methods were proposed in either laboratory or unstructured real-world environments. To clarify the scope and challenges of existing research, this review categorizes trajectory planning strategies into two major types based on application scenarios: (1) strategies for laboratory settings with controllable disturbances, which usually involve optimal control for gait under stable or controllable conditions; and (2) strategies for real-world environments characterized by varying terrain, individual differences, and gait fluctuations, which usually involve adaptive control for gait under diverse or unstructured conditions. Given the foundational role of gait phase detection in trajectory planning, this review also systematically examines mainstream algorithms for gait phase recognition and estimation. Finally, the paper analyzes the limitations of existing methods and discusses the potential of advanced algorithms, intelligent multimodal sensing systems, novel sensing technologies, and embedded deployment to enhance the performance of exoskeleton assistive trajectory planning.",

      "title": "Decoding Spikes From Multiunit Data",
      "content": "Communication and control in biological systems is mediated by the timing of discharges \u2013spikes\u2013 from excitable cells such as neurons and muscle fibers. Each spike is associated to a characteristic waveform that can be captured by sensors. The waveform's characteristics depend on the cell's biophysical properties and the recording modality. Depending on the technique, e.g., electrical recordings with electrodes, optical imaging, ultrasound, the observed signals are mixtures of waveforms emitted from active cells/sources (multiunit data/signals). Recovering the timing and identity of these sources (multiunit or spike decoding) is central to neuroscience, clinical diagnostics, and neural interfacing, yet it remains challenging due to waveform superposition, non-stationarity, limited training labels, and the computational demands of high-density recordings. This review provides a unified methodological perspective on spike decoding by formalizing the problem as a sparse source separation task under a convolutive mixing model. Rather than organizing the literature by application domain, we group and critically compare methods by their underlying principles: classical spike sorting, Bayesian and probabilistic inference, blind source separation, and data-driven approaches, including deep learning and hybrid schemes. For each class of methods, we present the core mathematical formulation and algorithmic strategies and discuss assumptions and limitations. Our synthesis highlights parallels in signal processing across physical recording modalities and clarifies when and why particular approaches succeed or fail. By bridging previously compartmentalized literature, this survey aims to accelerate crosspollination of ideas between application areas and to provide a roadmap for selecting, adapting, and advancing decoding methods across diverse multiunit recording modalities.",

      "title": "Using Real-time Reporting to Investigate Visual Experiences in Dreams",
      "content": "Neuroscientific investigations of human dreaming have been hampered by reliance on dream recall after awakening. For example, a challenge of associating EEG features with post-waking dream reports is that they are subject to distortion, forgetting, and poor temporal precision. In this study, we used real-time reporting to investigate whether one of the most robust features of the waking visual system, increased alpha oscillations upon closing one's eyes, also applies when people dream of closing their eyes. We studied 13 people, four with narcolepsy and nine without, who experienced many lucid dreams\u2014they were aware they were dreaming while remaining asleep. They reported on both their dream experiences (visual percepts present/absent) and dream-eyelid status (open/closed) using a novel communication technique; they produced distinctive sniffing patterns according to presleep instructions. We observed these signals in respiration recordings from a nasal cannula. These physiological signals enabled analyses of time-locked neural activity during REM sleep. We recorded 150 signals over 19 sessions from 11 individuals. Robust increases in alpha power were not found after signaled dream-eye closure. Remarkably, the experience of eye closure while dreaming was associated with fading visual content only about half the time. Comparing the presence versus absence of visual content was possible only in three participants, who showed increased alpha power in association with a momentary lack of visual content. Enlisting dreamers to actively control and report on ongoing dream experiences in this way thus opens new avenues for dynamic investigations of dreams\u2014the illusory perceptions that haunt our sleep.",

      "title": "The Neural Consequences of Semantic Composition",
      "content": "Humans can create completely new concepts through semantic composition. These \u201cconceptual combinations\u201d can be created by attributing the features of one concept to another (e.g., a \u201clemon flamingo\u201d might be a yellow flamingo) or drawing on a relationship between concepts (e.g., a \u201clemon flamingo\u201d might consume lemons). We ask how semantic composition modulates the neural representations of underlying concepts. Combining fMRI with multivariate pattern analysis, we interrogate neural patterns for concepts before and after they were subjected to semantic composition. We observe a postcomposition shift in neural patterns underlying weakly constrained concepts in the visual system. The composition of strongly constrained combinations draws on a network of semantic regions that include the right inferior frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left lateral anterior temporal lobe, and posterior cingulate cortex. Finally, a subset of the semantic network, in the left parahippocampal gyrus, distinguishes the manner of composition: relational or attributive. These findings reveal that semantic composition has neural consequences for the composed concepts and that the manner of composition affects how the brain's semantic network is deployed.",

      "title": "Hindering Memory Suppression by Perturbing the Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex",
      "content": "A reminder of the past can trigger the involuntary retrieval of an unwanted memory. Yet, we can intentionally stop this process and thus prevent the memory from entering awareness. Such suppression not only transiently hinders the retrieval of the memory, it can also induce forgetting. Neuroimaging has implicated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in initiating this process. Specifically, this region seems to downregulate activity in brain systems that would otherwise support memory reinstatement. Here, we probed the causal contribution of the right dlPFC to suppression by combining the think/no-think task with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Participants first learned pairs of cue and target words and then repeatedly recalled some of the targets (think condition) and suppressed others (no-think condition). We applied 10-Hz rTMS bursts to the right dlPFC during the suppression of half the no-think items and to the contralateral primary motor area (M1) as an active control site during the other half. As hypothesized, participants experienced less success at keeping the memories out of awareness with concurrent dlPFC than M1 stimulation. Similarly, a memory test yielded evidence for suppression-induced forgetting (SIF) following M1 but not dlPFC stimulation. However, the difference in forgetting between the stimulation conditions was not significant. The study thus provides causal evidence for the role of the dlPFC in preventing retrieval. Future work will need to conclusively establish the relationship between this transient effect and SIF.",

      "title": "Neural Reinstatement of Encoding Context Mediates the Switch between Fear and Extinction Recall",
      "content": "Fear conditioning and extinction generate conflicting memory representations for a conditioned stimulus (CS). Retrieval of either memory is largely determined by the context where the CS is encountered. While fear typically generalizes to CSs encountered in new contexts, extinction is specific to the environment in which it was learned. Here, we used an fMRI design (n = 30, 16 women) to tag and track the extent to which individual participants reinstated competing episodic mental contexts associated with threat conditioning and extinction. We examined whether reactivation of past encoding contexts influences threat expectancy behavior and neural responses to a threat-ambiguous CS encountered in a new context. Results showed that the relative balance between conditioning and extinction context reinstatement in higher-order visual cortex influenced threat expectancy and neural activity in canonical threat processing regions. The link between context reinstatement and fear-related processes was specific to an extinguished CS, as opposed to an unextinguished CS that had never been encountered in the extinction context. These effects were observed 24 hr later, but not after 3 weeks. Additionally, threat conditioning produced long-lasting changes in primary sensory cortex that persisted up to 3 weeks following extinction. These findings show that neural representations of threat can endure over long durations, even in the healthy brain. Our results indicate competition between divergent mental contexts determines feelings of danger or safety when the meaning of the CS is ambiguous and suggest a mechanism by which the brain resolves ambiguity by reinstating the more dominant context associated with either fear or extinction.",

      "title": "Regulating Negative Autobiographical Memories: An fMRI Investigation of Reappraisal and Distraction in Middle-aged and Older Adults",
      "content": "Cognitive reappraisal and attentional distraction constitute two core strategies for regulating emotions. Prior studies have largely focused on young adults regulating simple laboratory stimuli, with few direct comparisons of brain regions that differentiate or mutually implement these strategies. Here, we expanded the typical age range of participants, compared reappraisal and distraction within participants, and used ecologically valid autobiographical memories as regulatory targets. Sixty-two healthy adults aged 35\u201375 years generated cue words for negative and neutral autobiographical memories and were trained to either reappraise, distract, or let their emotions flow naturally in response to cued memories. Strategy-specific contrasts were derived from whole-brain fMRI data using univariate analyses. For reappraisal, relative to flow, we observed activity in bilateral occipital cortex, right cerebellum, and cingulate cortex and primarily left-sided frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Distraction, relative to flow, engaged bilateral lateral prefrontal, medial parietal, cingulate, occipital, and retrosplenial regions and left cerebellum. Common areas of activation included midline occipital and posterior cingulate cortices. Direct comparisons yielded strategy differences across multiple cortical areas: distraction engaged paralimbic areas (insula and left parahippocampal gyrus), dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC, and right inferior frontoparietal cortex, whereas reappraisal engaged dorsomedial PFC, left ventrolateral PFC, anterior temporal cortex, and left posterolateral PFC. In-scanner valence ratings verified the efficacy of the experimental manipulation and revealed a negative impact of age on reappraisal success, which was correlated with greater visual cortical processing. These findings extend knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms of emotion regulation across the adult lifespan for autobiographical events.",

      "title": "Hill-Type Models of Skeletal Muscle and Neuromuscular Actuators: A Systematic Review",
      "content": "Backed by a century of research and development, Hill-type models of skeletal muscle, often including a muscle-tendon complex and neuromechanical interface, are widely used for countless applications. Lacking recent comprehensive reviews, the field of Hill-type modeling is, however, dense and hard-to-explore, with detrimental consequences on innovation. Here we present the first systematic review of Hill-type muscle modeling. It aims to clarify the literature by detailing its contents and critically discussing the state-of-the-art by identifying the latest advances, current gaps, and potential future directions in Hill-type modeling. For this purpose, fifty-eight criteria-abiding Hill-type models were assessed according to a completeness evaluation, which identified the modelled muscle properties, and a modeling evaluation, which considered the level of validation and reusability of the models, as well as their modeling strategy and calibration. It is concluded that most models (1) do not significantly advance beyond historical foundational standards, (2) neglect the importance of parameter identification, (3) lack robust validation, and (4) are not reusable in other studies. Besides providing a convenient tool supported by extensive supplementary materials for navigating the literature, the results of this review highlight the need for global recommendations in Hill-type modeling to optimize inter-study consistency, knowledge transfer, and model reusability.",

      "title": "Network Models of Neurodegeneration: Bridging Neuronal Dynamics and Disease Progression",
      "content": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the biological processes underlying disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden disrupts neuronal function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding, although recent studies have begun to bridge the two by coupling neuronal and pathological processes. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, mathematical models that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology are needed. This review surveys the two modeling approaches and highlights efforts to unify them, emphasizing that linking neuronal activity and disease progression is key to identifying strategies that slow, halt, or reverse degeneration and restore neural function.",

      "content": "Current clinical methods often overlook individual variability by relying on population-wide trials, while mechanism-based trials remain underutilized in neuroscience due to the brain\u2019s complexity. This situation may change through the use of a Virtual Brain Twin (VBT), which is a personalized digital replica of an individual\u2019s brain, integrating structural and functional brain data into advanced computational models and inference algorithms. By bridging the gap between molecular mechanisms, whole-brain dynamics, and imaging data, VBTs enhance the understanding of (patho)physiological mechanisms, advancing insights into both healthy and disordered brain function. Central to VBT is the network modeling that couples mesoscopic representation of neuronal activity through white matter connectivity, enabling the simulation of brain dynamics at a network level. This transformative approach provides interpretable predictive capabilities, supporting clinicians in personalizing treatments and optimizing interventions. This Review outlines the key components of VBT development, covering the conceptual, mathematical, technical, and clinical aspects. We describe the stages of VBT construction\u2013from anatomical coupling and modeling to simulation and Bayesian inference\u2013and demonstrate their applications in resting-state, healthy aging, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. Finally, we discuss potential extensions to other neurological disorders, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, and explore future applications in consciousness research and brain-computer interfaces, paving the way for advancements in personalized medicine and brain-machine integration.",

      "title": "Emerging Noninvasive Approaches for the Suppression of Pathological Tremor",
      "content": "Pathological tremor affects over 40 million people worldwide, significantly impairing daily activities and quality of life. Pharmacological treatments show limited efficacy, with up to 30% discontinuation rates, while surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation achieve significant tremor reduction but are often unsuitable due to age, comorbidities, or personal preference. Recently, the need for safe and effective alternatives has led to the development of innovative, noninvasive, and patient-friendly technologies for tremor management. This clinical application review analyzed 134 studies (1969-2025), categorizing them into three major modalities, focusing on their underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, with a special emphasis on the clinical perspective. The three considered modalities were force-controlling (orthoses and functional electrical stimulation), central neuromodulation (transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial electrical stimulation, low-intensity focused ultrasound, and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation), and peripheral neuromodulation (afferent stimulation and vibration). Force-controlling strategies showed promising acute effects, though clinical translation remains limited by poor wearability and the development of muscle fatigue. Central neuromodulation produced moderate effects, while peripheral neuromodulation has gained clinical traction, with several devices now being commercially available. However, heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and technology maturity remain the main obstacles for the direct comparison of techniques. Future research should prioritize larger multicenter trials, standardized outcome measures, and accessibility considerations to enable personalized, evidence-based treatment selection for diverse tremor populations.",
