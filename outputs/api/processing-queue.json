      "title": "Impaired development of the medial olivocochlear system in a KCNQ4-deficient mouse model.",
      "content": "The medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system modulates outer hair cell (OHC) excitability and protects cochlea from overstimulation. Cholinergic activation of alpha9alpha10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) triggers Ca+2 influx, activating BK and SK2 Ca+2-dependent K+; channels, and K+ extrusion through KCNQ4 to restore membrane potential. KCNQ4-loss causes chronic depolarization, OHC dysfunction, and hearing loss. Here, we investigated how KCNQ4 deficiency affects cochlear efferent synapse development and organization. Using confocal immunofluorescence, we analyzed efferent innervation in the organ of Corti of Kcnq4-/- (KO) and Kcnq4+/+ (WT) mice at 2, 3, 4, and 10 postnatal weeks (W). At 2 W, efferent terminals were similarly distributed between basal and lateral OHC membrane domains in both genotypes. During maturation, WT mice exhibited complete relocation of MOC terminals to the basal domain, whereas KO mice showed delayed maturation, with some terminals laterally displaced up to 10 W. KCNQ4 absence was associated with reduced number and volume of efferent boutons on OHCs. Milder morphometric alterations were observed in efferent boutons within the inner hair cell region. At the molecular level, qPCR revealed downregulation of alpha10 nAChR subunit, BK, and SK2 transcripts in KO at 4 W, with recovery to 10 W. Despite this recovery, BK protein showed reduced expression, mislocalization, and disorganized synaptic plaques in OHCs. KO also displayed age-dependent upregulation of the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and calretinin, suggesting compensatory responses to altered Ca+2 homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate that KCNQ4 is essential for OHC repolarization, maturation and maintenance of cochlear efferent synapses.",

      "title": "Neuronal integrity is altered in the ipsilesional hand sensory territory in late stroke",
      "content": "Background: Sensorimotor remapping plays a crucial role in the rehabilitation of hand function after stroke. While motor remapping has been intensively investigated at various levels, from functional to metabolic, limited attention has been given to somatosensory cortical remapping. This study extends our previous work showing functionally relevant metabolic alterations in radiologically normal-appearing or spared motor cortices, predominantly in the ipsilesional (stroke-injured) hemisphere, during the chronic phase of stroke. Precisely, we investigated the metabolic status of the ipsilesional primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and its relation to hand impairment in late stroke. Methods: Fourteen individuals with a chronic (mean {+/-} SD, 21.1 {+/-} 36.9 months post-onset) ischemic subcortical stroke, exhibiting moderate hand impairment (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity, 44.8 {+/-} 20.9; Jamar dynamometer, 54.1% {+/-} 40.9% of the non-paretic hand), but without sensory deficits, and ten matched healthy controls participated. MR Spectroscopy markers of neuronal status (N-acetylaspartate) and neuronal-glial glutamatergic cycle/neurotransmission (glutamate-glutamine complex) were measured in the ipsilesional S1 (3T, Allegra Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Between-group comparison of brain-tissue-corrected levels of these markers (LCModel, SPM12, MATLAB 2023a) and correlation analyses were performed (SPSS v26). Results: Compared with controls, patients showed significantly lower N-acetylaspartate levels (by 14.5%, p = 0.03) but no significant alterations in glutamate-glutamine levels (by -4.0%, p = 0.6). Significant correlations were found between N-acetylaspartate and the glutamate-glutamine complex in patients (p = 0.02), but not in controls (p = 0.06). No significant correlations were found between S1 markers and hand impairment (p > 0.05 for all). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with lower cortical excitability in the ipsilesional S1 in chronic stroke survivors. Further work on the functional relevance of such findings, using larger sample sizes, is warranted.",

      "content": "There is a pressing need for effective alternatives to opioid analgesics, the development of which requires the identification of novel anti-nociceptive drug targets. Here, we have further investigated the anti-nociceptive properties of a GPR35 agonist, cromolyn, in an in vitro model of inflammatory sensitisation. We used ratiometric Ca2+ imaging of cultured sensory neurons to examine the effect of cromolyn on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated sensitisation of the pro-nociceptive ion channel, transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1). The sensitisation of TRPV1 by PGE2 was inhibited by cromolyn in a GPR35-dependent manner. These observations provide further evidence in support of an anti-nociceptive role for GPR35, highlighting the potential use of GPR35 agonists as analgesics.",

      "title": "A novel protocol for the efficient generation of all three major hippocampal neuronal sub-populations from human pluripotent stem cells",
      "content": "The diverse computational functions of the human hippocampus rely on coordinated interactions among dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1 subfields, yet generating all three neuronal identities in vitro - particularly CA1 - has remained challenging. Here we establish a reproducible and modular differentiation protocol that directs human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through dorsomedial telencephalic progenitors to yield DG, CA3, and CA1 neuronal subtypes together with hippocampal regionally specified astrocytes. Early tri-inhibition combined with Sonic hedgehog suppression produced dorsal forebrain progenitors (FOXG1+, PAX6+), while FGF2 treatment supported progenitor maintenance and induced TBR2+ intermediate progenitors. Controlled WNT activation using CHIR99021 drove progressive enrichment of PROX1 hippocampal progenitors across two independent donor lines. Terminal differentiation produced MAP2+/TAU+ neurons that expressed DG (PROX1), CA3 (GRIK4), and CA1 (WFS1, OCT6) markers, with maturing synaptic puncta. Defined progenitors generated long-lived (>400 days) hippocampal organoids exhibiting mixed neuronal-glial populations and spontaneous activity characterized by increased firing rates, high information entropy, and hub-like causal connectivity relative to monolayers, whereas astrocytes-supplemented monolayers displayed intermediate maturation. Population level electrophysiological analysis was also conducted to explore the dynamics of these different cultures. This platform enables systematic experimental control over neuron-astrocyte ratios, culture geometry, and developmental timing, providing a foundation for mechanistic studies of human hippocampal development, circuit function, and disease.",

Here, we use high-speed atomic force microscopy to visualize inter-holoenzyme interaction of CaMKII at mesoscopic scales (5-500 nm). Under freely diffusible conditions, CaMKII holoenzymes do not form stable clusters. In contrast, when spatially confined, they assemble into worm-like chain clusters mediated by kinase-domain interactions. These clusters expand upon activation, concomitant with the dissociation of the regulatory segment. Notably, the CaMKII P212L mutant associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, forms extensive clusters even in the basal state. Together, our findings demonstrate that CaMKII-CaMKII interactions drive mesoscale cluster formation and that precise regulation of cluster size and activation-dependent growth might be critical for synaptic signaling.",

      "title": "Direct evidence from kinetic D2O-MRI modeling that the choroid plexus is not the major source of cerebrospinal fluid",
      "content": "The role of the choroid plexus (CP) as the primary source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remains controversial. Here, we used dynamic indirect D2O magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4T to investigate whole-brain CSF dynamics in rats. Spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) was performed during intravenous D2O infusion with a temporal resolution of 10.69 s and an in-plane resolution of 150 * 150 um. An echo time of 150.0 ms was employed to effectively suppress signals from brain parenchyma, blood, and interstitial fluid, resulting in preferential visualization of CSF. The ambient and supracerebellar cisterns (AC+SC) exhibited the greatest signal attenuation, reaching 47.32 +- 15.70% of baseline, whereas the lateral ventricles (LV1, LV2) showed smaller reductions (68.73 +- 18.72%-72.64 +- 15.07% of baseline). CSF production rates were quantified using a one-compartment perfusion model. Estimated secretion rates were 0.11 and 0.13 uL/min in the lateral ventricles and 1.30 uL/min in the AC+SC region, indicating a 5.42-fold higher CSF production outside the ventricles. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence that the lateral ventricles are not the primary site of CSF production. The proposed D2O-based dynamic SE-EPI approach is safe, non-invasive, cost-effective, and suitable for widespread application.",

      "title": "Musculoskeletal design of the human shoulder: implications for neuromuscular control",
      "content": "The shoulder complex is a unique musculoskeletal structure capable of versatile motor behaviour yet requiring delicate control. The purpose of our work was to better understand the nature of musculoskeletal redundancy at the shoulder accounting for biomechanical demands and motor control strategies. Using a biomechanical model of the shoulder, we simulated a series of static exertions. Joint moment results from inverse dynamics were combined with an iterative sampling method to survey the landscape of feasible muscle activity patterns. By repeating the sampling process across different numbers of degrees of freedom at the shoulder, we demonstrate how emergent solutions are shaped by the biomechanical demands at each of the shoulder joints. Furthermore, we observed that the degree of musculoskeletal redundancy appears to be higher among the scapulohumeral muscles than the thoracohumeral and thoracoscapular muscles. Finally, we found that many of the muscle activity patterns requiring similar effort costs as the minimal effort solution have similar activation profiles, but there can be a wide range of possibilities especially at greater task intensities. Altogether, the simulations provide insight into neuromuscular control and musculoskeletal model decision-making process for the shoulder.",

      "title": "Evolution of visual time throughout goal driven action learning",
      "content": "Timing is intimately woven into human cognition and behaviour, underscoring people's ability of comprehending speech, playing instruments and competing in sports. Converging evidence suggests that our perceptual experience of time is grounded in our ability to control actions: time processing leverages motor control neural machinery, and perceived time is significantly distorted in proximity of action. However, the dynamic interplay between timing and action systems remains unexplored, particularly in goal-directed contexts where action control is gradually refined through practice. Through combined behavioural, neural and modelling approaches, we investigate how time processing gradually evolves as participants gain experience in goal-driven manual reaching actions, varying in terms of action-plan specificity. Participants judged brief visual durations while preparing hand movements aimed at visual targets displayed on a monitor. Subjective time expanded in the foreperiod preceding action onset, and this effect increased over trials, mirroring gradual improvements in action readiness as motor plans became more rapidly and efficiently deployed. Representation Similarity Analysis, integrating electroencephalographic and behavioural data, reveals that actions shape timing through independent mechanisms: planning specific behaviours shapes how duration information is written into timekeeping neural circuits as stimuli unfold (encoding). Parallely, more general aspects of motor engagement and anticipation shape how duration information is read-out from timing circuits following stimulus presentation (decoding). These findings highlight a dynamic, learning-driven coupling between perceptual time and motor control, where subjective time is recalibrated as goal-directed action preparation is optimized, shaped through independent time encoding and decoding mechanisms.",

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.
