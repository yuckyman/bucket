      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "title": "Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.04047v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It\u2019s been about 7 months since I last posted in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/\">r/selfhosted</a> sub, and today I\u2019m excited to share that <strong>Bedrock Server Manager (BSM)</strong> has just hit version <strong>3.7.0</strong>.</p> <p>For those who don't know, BSM is a python web server designed to make managing Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Servers simple, efficient, and automatable.</p> <p>BSM is one of, if not, <strong>the most easiest server manager to setup and use</strong>!</p> <p>BSM has grown a lot since the last update. BSM also passed <strong>25,000 installs on PyPI</strong> and seeing a steady stream of stars on GitHub. I never could have imagined that the project would grow so big and so fast! A big thanks to everyone for helping the project reach this massive milestone! \ud83c\udf89</p> <p>I've spent the last half-year completely refactoring the core to be faster, more modular, and developer-friendly. Here is the rundown of the massive changes since the last update post:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Full FastAPI Rewrite:</strong> BSM migrated from Flask to <strong>FastAPI</strong> for better performance, async capabilities, and automatic API documentation.</li> <li><strong>WebSockets:</strong> The dashboard now uses FastAPI's WebSocket for real-time server console streaming and status updates.</li> <li><strong>Plugin System:</strong> BSM is now extensible. You can write Python plugins to add your own API routes, Web UI pages, or actions based on events.</li> <li><strong>Docker Support:</strong> Official Docker support is now live. You can spin up managed servers in seconds using our optimized images.</li> <li><strong>Multi-User &amp; Auth:</strong> Complete multi-user support with role-based access control (Admin, Moderator, User). Great for communities where you want to give staff limited access.</li> <li><strong>Database Driven:</strong> Moved from JSON configs to a proper <strong>SQLite</strong> database (with support for external databases like Postgres/MySQL), making data management much more robust.</li> <li><a href=\"https://github.com/DMedina559/bsm-home-assistant-integration\"><strong>Home Assistant Integration</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Manage your servers from Home Assistant! Automate various aspect such as lifecycle, backups, or even addon installs!</li> </ul> <h1>For the Developers</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Modern CLI:</strong> Switched from standard argparse to <strong>Click</strong> and <strong>Questionary</strong> for a much better interactive CLI experience.</li> <li><strong>Dev-Friendly Docs:</strong> Documentation is now auto-generated using Sphinx and hosted on <a href=\"https://bedrock-server-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\">Read the Docs</a>.</li> </ul> <h1>Links</h1> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/DMedina559/bedrock-server-manager\">https://github.com/DMedina559/bedrock-server-manager</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/bedrock-server-manager/\">https://pypi.org/project/bedrock-server-manager/</a></li> <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://bedrock-server-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">Read the Docs</a></li> </ul> <p>If you find the tool useful, a Star on GitHub is always appreciated\u2014it really helps the project grow! And another big thanks to everyone for helping the project grow!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BlazeCrafter420\"> /u/BlazeCrafter420 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5u7n8/bedrock_server_manager_milestones_achieved/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5u7n8/bedrock_server_manager_milestones_achieved/\">[comments]</a></span>",
