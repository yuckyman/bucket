      "title": "Launch HN: Kenobi (YC W22) \u2013 Personalize your website for every visitor",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We\u2019re Rory, Chris, and Felix from Kenobi (<a href=\"https://kenobi.ai\">https://kenobi.ai</a>). Kenobi lets you add AI-based content personalization to any website. As a site owner, you install our personalization widget with a script tag, just like you would for e.g. a chatbot integration. As a visitor, you interact with the widget (right now by providing a company name) and Kenobi changes the site content to suit you.<p>We\u2019ve built a demo that anyone can try here: <a href=\"https://kenobi.ai/start\">https://kenobi.ai/start</a><p>We believe that large parts of the web are about to go from being static to dynamic because of how adept LLMs are at transforming rendered HTML. And right now we\u2019re focussing on B2B landing page content (as opposed to application UIs) because there is a lot of commercial opportunity for increasing top-of-funnel inbound conversions.<p>Our journey to Kenobi today is a long and snaking one. You may notice from the post title that we did YC\u2019s Winter 2022 batch (I know that 4 years is practically ancient in YC-dog-years). Kenobi is a hard pivot from our original idea that we got accepted into YC with \u2014 a company called Verdn which did trackable environmental donations via an API. Since the summer, we\u2019ve been hacking on different ideas\u2026 We started with personalized UI screenshots for outbound campaigns, but then people told us they wanted transformations to their actual site[0] \u2014 so we built an agentic workflow to research a visitor-company and \u201cpre-render\u201d changes to a landing site for them. Ultimately, there was too much friction in getting people to incorporate personalized URLs into their cold outbound campaigns[1]. Besides, people kept asking for us to do this for their inbound traffic, and so our current iteration was born.<p>Right now with Kenobi you pick a page that you\u2019d like to make customizable, and choose [text] elements that you\u2019d like to make dynamic. You can define custom prompting instructions for these elements, and when someone visits your page, our agentic workflow researches their company, and presents the updated content as quickly as possible, usually within a few seconds.[2] You also get a ping in Slack every time this happens so you know who is using your site.<p>We\u2019ve been experimenting with features such as generating custom imagery that actually looks good and native to the page design, and pulling in company data sources so that e.g. the right case study can be presented based on a visitor\u2019s industry and ICP profile. Our most requested feature is deanonymizing traffic so that Kenobi\u2019s personalization can happen automatically as visitors land on your page \u2014 this is coming very soon, as right now you have to specify where you\u2019re coming from.<p>It\u2019s surprised us just how much business value we\u2019ve gotten from knowing who (most probably) is on the page and asking for a personalized experience. We\u2019ve seen response rates 3x of what we would normally from following people up from companies we know visited our site.<p>There are many players in this space already, and everyone seems to have their own angle. We are keen to hear thoughts on what people think the future of the personalized internet looks like!<p>Cheers from London!<p>P.S. - there's also a video that Chris recorded showing the end-to-end Kenobi experience right now <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/bc0a82a2f2fd40f695315bae80e8f5d8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/bc0a82a2f2fd40f695315bae80e8f5d8</a><p>[0] - Many of them had tried AI \u201cmicrosite\u201d generators but found the maintenance of managing a separate website(s) just for closing deals to be burdensome and inefficient.<p>[1] - Despite having a CSV export and Clay integration option for our pre-generated website changes, getting people to weave the URLs into their email sequences (everyone uses different tools) seemed almost insurmountable without building what would ostensibly be our own sequencing software.<p>[2] - We use light foundation models with grounded search for the research step, and translate these into markup changes via another light LLM pass and our own DSL which is optimized for speed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301865\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46301865</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 6</p>",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",
