      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "title": "Feature fusion based on global-local weighted attention model for automatic epileptic seizure detection",
      "content": "Objective. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which present significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in seizure detection, existing methods often struggle with accurately capturing the complex and dynamic interactions between temporal, spatial, and spectral features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This leads to limitations in the detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Approach. To address these challenges, we propose global-local weighted attention (GLWA) model, which integrates temporal, spatial, and spectral features through a local-global attention mechanism. At the same time, GLWA effectively balances both global and local features, capturing comprehensive information from EEG signals to enhance seizure detection accuracy. Main results. Our proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 98.82% and 98.89% on the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to effectively integrate these features, resulting in improved detection performance. Significance. Furthermore, we visualize the model\u2019s decision-making process to gain insights into the attention distribution across different brain regions and spectraluency bands, further emphasizing GLWA\u2019s potential in seizure detection. This work demonstrates the model\u2019s superior performance and interpretability, providing a robust approach for accurate and generalizable identification of seizures.",

Designer feedback is essential to improving performance on UI generation; however, we find that existing RLHF methods based on ratings or rankings are not well-aligned with designers' workflows and ignore the rich rationale used to critique and improve UI designs. In this paper, we investigate several approaches for designers to give feedback to UI generation models, using familiar interactions such as commenting, sketching and direct manipulation. We first perform a study with 21 designers where they gave feedback using these interactions, which resulted in ~1500 design annotations. We then use this data to finetune a series of LLMs to generate higher quality UIs. Finally, we evaluate these models with human judges, and we find that our designer-aligned approaches outperform models trained with traditional ranking feedback and all tested baselines, including GPT-5.",

      "title": "Generative AI alone may not be enough: Evaluating AI Support for Learning Mathematical Proof",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.16778v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-Tutor, a large language model (LLM)-powered tutoring system that combines an AI-based proof-review tutor for real-time feedback on proof-writing and a chatbot for mathematics-related queries. Our experiment, involving 148 students, demonstrated that the use of LLM-Tutor significantly improved homework performance compared to a control group without access to the system. However, its impact on exam performance and time spent on tasks was found to be insignificant. Mediation analysis revealed that students with lower self-efficacy tended to use the chatbot more frequently, which partially contributed to lower midterm scores. Furthermore, students with lower self-efficacy were more likely to engage frequently with the proof-review-AI-tutor, a usage pattern that positively contributed to higher final exam scores. Interviews with 19 students highlighted the accessibility of LLM-Tutor and its effectiveness in addressing learning needs, while also revealing limitations and concerns regarding potential over-reliance on the tool. Our results suggest that generative AI alone like chatbot may not suffice for comprehensive learning support, underscoring the need for iterative design improvements with learning sciences principles with generative AI educational tools like LLM-Tutor.",

      "title": "AI Knows Best? The Paradox of Expertise, AI-Reliance, and Performance in Educational Tutoring Decision-Making Tasks",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.16772v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present an empirical study of how both experienced tutors and non-tutors judge the correctness of tutor praise responses under different Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted interfaces, types of explanation (textual explanations vs. inline highlighting). We first fine-tuned several Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce binary correctness labels and explanations, achieving up to 88% accuracy and 0.92 F1 score with GPT-4. We then let the GPT-4 models assist 95 participants in tutoring decision-making tasks by offering different types of explanations. Our findings show that although human-AI collaboration outperforms humans alone in evaluating tutor responses, it remains less accurate than AI alone. Moreover, we find that non-tutors tend to follow the AI's advice more consistently, which boosts their overall accuracy on the task: especially when the AI is correct. In contrast, experienced tutors often override the AI's correct suggestions and thus miss out on potential gains from the AI's generally high baseline accuracy. Further analysis reveals that explanations in text reasoning will increase over-reliance and reduce underreliance, while inline highlighting does not. Moreover, neither explanation style actually has a significant effect on performance and costs participants more time to complete the task, instead of saving time. Our findings reveal a tension between expertise, explanation design, and efficiency in AI-assisted decision-making, highlighting the need for balanced approaches that foster more effective human-AI collaboration.",

By focusing on commemorative content posted on Sina Weibo following the deaths of seven prominent Chinese authors, the artwork employs data scraping, natural language processing, and 3D modeling to transform fragmented textual expressions into immersive digital monuments. Through the analysis of word frequencies, topic models, and user engagement metrics, the system constructs a semantic-visual landscape that reflects both authorial legacies and collective memory.

      "title": "Graphical Perception of Icon Arrays versus Bar Charts for Value Comparisons in Health Risk Communication",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.16465v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visualizations support critical decision making in domains like health risk communication. This is particularly important for those at higher health risks and their care providers, allowing for better risk interpretation which may lead to more informed decisions. However, the kinds of visualizations used to represent data may impart biases that influence data interpretation and decision making. Both continuous representations using bar charts and discrete representations using icon arrays are pervasive in health risk communication, but express the same quantities using fundamentally different visual paradigms. We conducted a series of studies to investigate how bar charts, icon arrays, and their layout (juxtaposed, explicit encoding, explicit encoding plus juxtaposition) affect the perception of value comparison and subsequent decision-making in health risk communication. Our results suggest that icon arrays and explicit encoding combined with juxtaposition can optimize for both accurate difference estimation and perceptual biases in decision making. We also found misalignment between estimation accuracy and decision making, as well as between low and high literacy groups, emphasizing the importance of tailoring visualization approaches to specific audiences and evaluating visualizations beyond perceptual accuracy alone. This research contributes empirically-grounded design recommendations to improve comparison in health risk communication and support more informed decision-making across domains.",
