      "title": "Benchmarking resting state fMRI connectivity pipelines for classification: Robust accuracy despite processing variability in cross-site eye state prediction",
      "content": "The rapid evolution of machine learning (ML) methods has yielded promising results in human brain neuroscience. However, the reproducibility of ML applications in neuroimaging remains limited, challenging the generalizability of inferences to broader populations. In addition to the inherent variability of the brain activity (both in healthy and pathological states), poor reproducibility is further enhanced by inconsistencies in data preprocessing techniques and methods for calculating functional connectivity (FC), which are used as parameters for brain state classification. To systematically assess the impact of abovementioned factors on ML applications to fMRI data, we benchmarked a comprehensive set of FC analysis pipelines for the classification task between fMRI data recorded in two fundamentally different states: eyes open and eyes closed. In contrast to studies involving heterogeneous clinical populations or using complex cognitive tasks, our controlled experimental design - based on two independent datasets of healthy participants collected in different laboratories - minimizes variability related to a task design or pathological brain states. Classification accuracy and reproducibility were compared for 192 distinct FC analysis pipelines, covering common preprocessing approaches, brain parcellation schemes, and connectivity metrics. Notably, we employed a cross-site validation strategy, training predictive models on data from one site and testing them on the other. Despite the substantial variability in pipeline configurations, we observed consistently high classification accuracy (~80%), confirming that FC-based models can robustly discriminate between well-defined brain states (eye conditions) across different acquisition sites. Best results both in terms of classification accuracy and stability were observed using Pearson correlation and tangent correlation as FC, Brainnetome as atlas, and confound regression strategies based on the CompCor method. These findings highlight the resilience of rs-fMRI FC-derived characteristics to methodological variation and support their utility in the discovery of biomarkers, particularly in settings that involve stable and reproducible brain states.",

      "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
      "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

      "content": "The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",

Yet, increasing the resolution of these displays requires increasing the number of individually addressable actuators while simultaneously reducing their total surface area, power consumption, and weight, challenges most evidently reflected in the dearth of affordable multiline braille displays....",
