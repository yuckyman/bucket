      "title": "Launch HN: Karumi (YC F25) \u2013 Personalized, agentic product demos",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Toni and Pablo, and we're building Karumi (<a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai\">https://www.karumi.ai</a>), a system that lets your users get instant, scalable, guided demos of your product, fully automated, zero human interaction. It works in any language.<p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a>. There's also a live demo at  <a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz\">https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz</a>.<p>Karumi is an AI agent that operates a real web app in a shared browser session and talks the user through it. Instead of a human giving a screen-share demo, the agent opens your product, clicks around, fills forms, and explains what it\u2019s doing. We started building this as an internal tool at our previous company. As the product grew, people kept asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the right way to demo feature X?\u201c. Docs and scripts became outdated quickly, and the quality of demos depended too much on who was presenting. We wanted something closer to a repeatable program: an agent that knows the main flows, understands who it\u2019s talking to, and can walk through the product without getting lost.<p>Over time this turned into three main components:<p>Planning/control layer<p>A loop that decides the next step: ask something, click, navigate, reset, etc. It uses a reasoning model, but only within a fixed set of allowed actions with guards (timeouts, depth limits, reset states). It never gets free control of the browser.<p>Browser execution layer<p>A controlled browser session, streamed in a video call. The agent can only interact with the elements we want. We log each action with a timestamp and the agent\u2019s \u201creason\u201d, which helps debug odd behavior.<p>Product knowledge layer<p>We ingest docs, demo scripts & videos, and usage analytics, to train the agent. At runtime, the agent uses its knowledge to decide what flow to show and how to explain it.<p>Some practical details and limitations:<p>We only support web apps right now. Desktop apps will come next.\nLLMs introduce non-determinism, so we bias toward safe, predictable behavior: checkpoints, conservative navigation, and \u201cescape hatches\u201d that reset to known states.\nIf the agent doesn\u2019t understand a UI state (unknown modal, layout shift, etc.), it asks the user instead of guessing.\nRegarding pricing, it\u2019s still early. We tailor it to each customer based on their needs. Our current thinking is a platform fee plus a per-call charge for the agent. The platform fee varies depending on complexity, support requirements, and overall scope.<p>People currently use Karumi for inbound demos and internal demo environments. If you want to see it inside a real product, here\u2019s Karumi running in Deel\u2019s platform: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a><p>We\u2019ll be around to answer questions and look forward to your feedback!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>",

      "title": "Characterization of hippocampal subfields using histology-based annotated postmortem MRI: Lessons for in vivo segmentation II",
      "content": "High-resolution in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampal subfields is a rapidly advancing field due to their implication in cognition, disorder, and disease. Hippocampal subfield segmentation on in vivo MRI is generally guided by postmortem reference material, which has been limited by small sample sizes that preclude comprehensive characterization of subfield border locations and their variability. Addressing this, we characterized hippocampal subfield border variability in two ultra-high-resolution postmortem MRI datasets with combined annotated histological sections, including cases with and without dementia. We examined: 1) the order of appearance and disappearance of subfields along the long axis of the hippocampus; 2) the order of appearance and disappearance of subicular subregions; 3) the medial-lateral position of subicular subregional boundaries along the hippocampal body; 4) the location of the CA3 relative to hippocampal head digitations; 5) the subfield borders in the hippocampal body relative to a volume proportion of the dark band; and 6) the association of hippocampal length and subiculum-CA1 border location with diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging. Our findings reaffirmed that there is a consistent order of appearance and disappearance of subfields in the hippocampal head and tail, respectively. The subicular subregions exhibited a \"first in, last out\" order of appearance and disappearance, and pre/parasubiculum consistently occupied half of the subicular complex in coronal slices throughout the hippocampal body. Hippocampal head digitations were not a reliable landmark for CA3 appearance, but SRLM proportionality did offer a potentially consistent approach for estimating CA2 and CA3 subfield borders in relation to the hippocampal border. No clear relationship was found between the anatomical features and diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging. These findings have implications for the development and harmonization of hippocampal subfield segmentation protocols and interpretation of high-resolution functional MRI studies of the human hippocampus.",
