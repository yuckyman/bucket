      "title": "Investigating singing imagery as an additional or alternative control task for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces",
      "content": "IntroductionBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a movement-free means of communication and control, typically based on motor imagery (MI) tasks of hand, foot, or tongue movements. Most BCI studies focus on classifying up to four such tasks, which limits the number of available commands and restricts overall system functionality. Expanding the range of reliable mental tasks would directly increase the number of possible commands and thereby enhance the practical utility of BCIs. Singing imagery (SI) may offer an intuitive alternative or additional task to complement conventional MI paradigms.MethodsEEG data were recorded from 14 participants performing right-hand, left-hand, foot, and tongue MI, SI, and rest. Features were extracted using filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP), and tasks were classified with a random forest algorithm across 2-, 4-, 5-, and 6-class scenarios. Subjective data regarding participants' perceived task difficulty and general task preferences was also collected.ResultsClassification accuracies with SI included were comparable to subsets of conventional MI tasks in 2-, 4-, and 5-class scenarios. In the 6-class scenario, average accuracy was approximately 60%, with six participants exceeding 70%, the level often cited as being necessary for effective BCI control. It is reasonable to expect performance to improve further with more advanced analysis methods and participant training.ConclusionThese promising results suggest that singing imagery can serve as both an additional and an alternative task in MI-BCIs. In lower-class systems, SI may provide a valuable option for generating commands, particularly for users who may find some conventional MI tasks less intuitive. When combined with the established MI tasks, SI could increase the number of possible commands, thereby extending the functional capacity of BCI systems. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of SI to broaden the repertoire of mental tasks available for BCI control and to advance the development of more flexible, powerful, and user-centered BCI applications.",

      "title": "Investigating the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in language evolution: insights from comparative neuroscience",
      "content": "The evolutionary adaptation of the left inferior frontal gyrus is considered a crucial neural specialization supporting the emergence of human language. As a central node in the language network, it is linked to the temporoparietal cortex via both the ventral and dorsal pathways. These connections enable humans to combine a limited set of vocal elements into infinitely diverse, hierarchically structured sequences. Although homologous brain structures are also present in non-human primates, language remains a uniquely human faculty. This review synthesizes anatomical, functional, and connectivity evidence across species to trace the evolution of the left inferior frontal gyrus in support of language. We argue that language did not emerge from novel cortical areas, but through the gradual repurposing, expansion, and optimization of pre-existing fronto-temporal circuits. Human-specific innovations include vocal neuron specialization, volumetric expansion, strengthened connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus, and a functional shift within the left inferior frontal gyrus from motor control to syntactic processing. Finally, we discuss how lesion studies contribute to our understanding of the brain\u2019s potential for language acquisition and its neurobiological constraints.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11218v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Accessing video games is challenging for people with upper-limb impairments, especially when multiple inputs are required in rapid succession. Human cooperation, where a copilot assists the main player, has been proposed as a solution, but relying on a human assistant poses limitations in terms of availability and co-location. An alternative solution is to use partial automation, where the player is assisted by a software agent. In this work, we present a study with 13 participants with upper-limb impairments, comparatively evaluating how participants collaborate with their copilot in human cooperation and partial automation. The experiment is supported by GamePals, a modular framework that enables both human cooperation and partial automation on existing third-party video games.",

      "title": "Noisy Graph Patterns via Ordered Matrices",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.11171v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The high-level structure of a graph is a crucial ingredient for the analysis and visualization of relational data. However, discovering the salient graph patterns that form this structure is notoriously difficult for two reasons. (1) Finding important patterns, such as cliques and bicliques, is computationally hard. (2) Real-world graphs contain noise, and therefore do not always exhibit patterns in their pure form. Defining meaningful noisy patterns and detecting them efficiently is a currently unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose to use well-ordered matrices as a tool to both define and effectively detect noisy patterns. Specifically, we represent a graph as its adjacency matrix and optimally order it using Moran's $I$. Standard graph patterns (cliques, bicliques, and stars) now translate to rectangular submatrices. Using Moran's $I$, we define a permitted level of noise for such patterns. A combination of exact algorithms and heuristics allows us to efficiently decompose the matrix into noisy patterns. We also introduce a novel motif simplification that visualizes noisy patterns while explicitly encoding the level of noise. We showcase our techniques on several real-world data sets.",

      "title": "AI Twin: Enhancing ESL Speaking Practice through AI Self-Clones of a Better Me",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.11103v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Advances in AI have enabled ESL learners to practice speaking through conversational systems. However, most tools rely on explicit correction, which can interrupt the conversation and undermine confidence. Grounded in second language acquisition and motivational psychology, we present AI Twin, a system that rephrases learner utterances into more fluent English and delivers them in the learner's voice. Embodying a more confident and proficient version of the learner, AI Twin reinforces motivation through alignment with their aspirational Ideal L2 Self. Also, its use of implicit feedback through rephrasing preserves conversational flow and fosters an emotionally supportive environment. In a within-subject study with 20 adult ESL learners, we compared AI Twin with explicit correction and a non-personalized rephrasing agent. Results show that AI Twin elicited higher emotional engagement, with participants describing the experience as more motivating. These findings highlight the potential of self-representative AI for personalized, psychologically grounded support in ESL learning.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11072v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Within journalistic editorial processes, disclosing AI usage is currently limited to simplistic labels, which misses the nuance of how humans and AI collaborated on a news article. Through co-design sessions (N=10), we elicited 69 disclosure designs and implemented four prototypes that visually disclose human-AI collaboration in journalism. We then ran a within-subjects lab study (N=32) to examine how disclosure visualizations (Textual, Role-based Timeline, Task-based Timeline, Chatbot) and collaboration ratios (Primarily Human vs. Primarily AI) influenced visualization perceptions, gaze patterns, and post-experience responses. We found that textual disclosures were least effective in communicating human-AI collaboration, whereas Chatbot offered the most in-depth information. Furthermore, while role-based timelines amplified AI contribution in primarily human articles, task-based timeline shifted perceptions toward human involvement in primarily AI articles. We contribute Human-AI collaboration disclosure visualizations and their evaluation, and cautionary considerations on how visualizations can alter perceptions of AI's actual role during news article creation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11060v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present our first stage results from deploying an LLM-augmented visualization software in a classroom setting to engage primary school children with earth-related datasets. Motivated by the growing interest in conversational AI as a means to support inquiry-based learning, we investigate children's expectations, engagement, and evaluation of a spoken LLM interface with a shared, immersive visualization system in a formal educational context. Our system integrates a speech-capable large language model with an interactive spherical display. It enables children to ask natural-language questions and receive coordinated verbal explanations and visual responses through the LLM-augmented visualization updating in real time based on spoken queries. We report on a classroom study with Swedish children aged 9-10, combining structured observation and small-group discussions to capture expectations prior to interaction, interaction patterns during facilitated sessions, and children's reflections on their encounter afterward. Our results provide empirical insights into children's initial encounters with an LLM-enabled visualization platform within a classroom setting and their expectations, interactions, and evaluations of the system. These findings inform the technology's potential for educational use and highlight important directions for future research.",
