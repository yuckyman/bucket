      "title": "From Hands to Feet: Experience-Driven Plasticity in Secondary Somatosensory Cortex in People Born without Hands",
      "content": "In congenital handlessness, where individuals rely on their feet for compensatory manual functions, reorganization in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) appears limited to local shifts by adjacent body parts. It remains unclear how congenital handlessness and lifelong compensatory foot use shape the sensorimotor system beyond SI, and whether compensatory abilities can drive broader functional reorganization. Here, we used task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how compensatory foot use changes body representations in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) in people born without hands (individuals with upper-limb dysplasia, IDs). We found that IDs showed foot selectivity in the left hand-selective SII, with stronger foot activity than typically-developed (TD) control participants during action execution. Notably, this reorganization in the left SII hand area cannot simply be explained by this area's intrinsic organization - the typical secondary preference of this area in the TDs when hand responses are excluded, as this area in TDs shows shoulder - but not foot - selectivity when the hand activity is excluded. This indicates a functional reorganization dependent on the IDs' sensorimotor experience. Resting-state results further revealed altered functional connectivity between SII and primary sensorimotor regions in IDs. Our findings suggest that SII exhibits flexible, experience-dependent plasticity, revealing a hierarchical principle of cortical plasticity, whereby reorganization in the SI is constrained by somatotopic principles while SII reflects functionally or experience-dependent plasticity.",

      "title": "Poorer physical function is associated with elevated spatial entropy in the aging brain network landscape",
      "content": "Life is a constant struggle against disorder. As we age, our ability to maintain internal order declines. In the healthy human brain, order is observable in the form of functionally segregated brain network communities that exhibit spatial consistency. These communities associate with distinct cognitive and physical functions. When mapped into the brain, they form a functional landscape. We assessed the spatial disorder of these landscapes in older adults with a wide range of mobility using a modified version of Shannon entropy. We found that compared to younger adults, older adults had significantly higher entropy in the sensorimotor cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, and occipital lobe. Higher entropy in many of these regions was associated with worse physical function and higher body mass index in older adults. Findings suggest that spatial entropy in brain network landscapes may be a marker of declining physical function. Modifiable factors, such as losing excess weight, may help to ameliorate aging-related brain entropy increases in regions such as the sensorimotor cortex, which may in turn help to preserve physical function in older adults.",

      "title": "Motor System Oligodendroglia Atlas Reveals Activation States Associated with Region-Specific Vulnerability in ALS",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes, the second most abundant cell type in the motor cortex and the most abundant in the spinal cord, are increasingly recognized as active contributors to neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Yet their diversity and disease relevance in the central nervous system remain incompletely defined. Here, we generate a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of 176 samples, integrating 2 in-house and 16 publicly available datasets. It encompasses more than 1,000,000 cells (350,000 oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursors) from the human motor cortex and spinal cord in non-neurological controls and ALS patients. We identify a previously unrecognized oligodendrocyte subpopulation, marked by PPEF1, and uncover regional differences, with distinct OPALIN+ and RBFOX1+ oligodendrocyte proportions between cortex and spinal cord. Importantly, we demonstrate that 'disease-associated oligodendrocytes' (DAOs) represent a distinct activation state, rather than a distinct subpopulation. In ALS, spinal cord oligodendrocytes selectively shift toward reactive states, characterized by JUND-enriched regulon activity, heightened metabolic demand, increased intercellular signaling, and activation of cell-death pathways. Finally, we identify LRP2 as a novel transcriptional oligodendrocyte marker and find LRP2 and MBP proteins to be elevated in ALS cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a potential biomarker of oligodendrocyte dysfunction. Our study provides a systems-level framework to interpret oligodendrocyte and OPC changes in ALS, linking cell state shifts to molecular alterations that can guide biomarker and therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Lysosomal swelling triggers LRRK2 activity",
      "content": "LRRK2 is implicated in lysosomal functions, but the physiological upstream cues that engage endogenous LRRK2 activity are incompletely defined. Here we show that lysosomal swelling serves as a selective and reversible trigger for LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation, without requiring membrane damage. Acute inhibition of PIKfyve, but not the general disruption of phosphoinositide signaling, induces the robust accumulation of phosphorylated Rabs across endolysosomal membranes. Rescue of swelling through pharmacological restoration of lysosomal ionic imbalances from PIKfyve inhibition suppresses LRRK2 activation without restoring lysosomal function. Mechanical lysosomal swelling from indigestible osmolyte uptake causes a dose-dependent increase in LRRK2-mediated Rab phosphorylation on both swollen and non-swollen lysosomes. Together, these findings identify LRRK2 as a sensor of lysosomal volume and mechanical stress, not specifically membrane damage or PIKfyve inhibition. As lysosomal swelling is a shared pathological feature across LRRK2-linked diseases, these results reframe LRRK2 as part of an endolysosomal surveillance system responsive to lysosomal distension.",

      "title": "Charge density of multi-channel intra-cortical micro-stimulation modulates intensity and naturalness of evoked somatosensations",
      "content": "Human patients with somatosensory loss often experience severe motor deficits, causing profound challenges to independently accomplish typical tasks of daily life. Brain\u2013machine Interfaces (BMIs) offer the potential to restore lost functionality through direct electrical stimulation of the somatosensory cortex via intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS). By modulating temporal patterns of stimulation, our group has previously shown single-channel ICMS can evoke both naturalistic cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, accurate modulation of the sensory feedback\u2019s qualia (somatotopic location, intensity and description) will be critical for fluid, dexterous motor control. In nonhuman primate studies, multi-channel ICMS has shown promise in improving quantifiable metrics such as reaction time. In recent human work, multi-channel ICMS has improved discrimination performance; however, evoked qualia from multi-channel ICMS has not been well characterized. We hypothesized multi-channel ICMS could evoke unique qualia compared to single-channel. A human participant with tetraplegia and chronically implanted microelectrode arrays in primary somatosensory cortex, reported perceptual thresholds, sensation descriptions, intensity and somatotopic locations of single- and multi-channel ICMS patterns. We found multi-channel ICMS patterns evoked unique qualia compared to single-channel ICMS. To investigate the role of charge in producing these unique evoked sensory percepts, we delivered equal amounts of charge with differing spatial patterns across multiple electrodes. Multi-channel ICMS substantially reduced the minimum stimulation amplitude required to evoked somatosensations, lowering the charge per electrode detection threshold, while increasing the total charge injected. Delivered charge across multiple electrodes, positively modulated the sensation\u2019s perceived intensity; providing early evidence of spatial integration of ICMS in the target network. Multi-channel ICMS resulted in more frequent verbal reports of \u2018natural\u2019 sensation descriptors (100% vs 85% for single-channel ICMS, p-val < 0.05) and robustly evoked sensations with high repeatability in stable somatotopic locations. Multi-channel ICMS patterns demonstrated improvements in reliability, somatotopic coverage and \u2018natural-ness\u2019 of the evoked sensations, marking significant advances towards state-of-the-art somatosensory BMIs. By better understanding of the input/output relationship for somatosensory feedback BMIs, we can expect to improve movement accuracy and increase embodiment for human users.",

      "content": "BackgroundOptimization of brain health is a focal point in medical science, yet data regarding measuring, improving, and preserving lifelong brain health are lacking. This void demands an objective, change-sensitive measure of brain health and proven strategies to strengthen brain performance. The BrainHealth Project addresses these key issues, drawing upon neuroplasticity evidence of persistent modifiability of brain function across the lifespan. This landmark study aims to (i) evaluate and refine multidimensional change indices of brain health, (ii) evaluate the impact of evidenced-based cognitive strategies and lifestyle interventions on improving/maintaining brain health, and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms associated with brain health gains/losses.MethodsThis quantitative, longitudinal, interventional, open-label, single-arm clinical trial aims to recruit 100,000 generally healthy adults ages 18\u2013100 and evaluate changes for 10 years or longer. Assessments, coaching, and training are conducted online through the secure BrainHealth Platform, allowing utilization tracking. The BrainHealth Index (BHI) \u2013 a multidimensional assessment \u2013 is offered at baseline and every 6 months. Participants have access to coaching every 3 months and continual access to self-paced trainings and resources. The primary outcome is the composite BrainHealth Index score and its empirically derived subdomain scores: Clarity (cognitive health), Connectedness (social health), and Emotional Balance (mental health). The BHI includes validated measures sensitive to change, including gains or losses associated with behavior change and integration of cognitive strategies into daily life. This Index contrasts with traditional assessments focused primarily on detecting cognitive decline or diagnosing pathological conditions, yet it, too, has been found to be sensitive to small incremental losses. The primary online training, SMART (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Tactics), is a strategy-based program validated with 25+ years of research. SMART promotes improvements in neural health, cognition, wellbeing, connectedness, and real-life function, previously reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statistical approaches focus on individual prediction using nonlinear models trained with large samples and on assessing mechanisms influencing gains or losses on brain health metrics.DiscussionThis research extends prior RCT evidence to a longitudinal, epidemiologic approach, leveraging digital health and machine learning tools to deliver a generalizable measure of longitudinal brain health and actionable ways to achieve precision brain health. By integrating advanced statistical methods and large-scale data, the BrainHealth Project aims to provide medicine and society with accurate, multidimensional, sensitive, and actionable ways to optimize brain health practices across the lifespan.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, </p> <p>I'm a senior business analyst in a big company, started in audit for few years and 10 years as BA. I'm working with Excel on a daily basis, very strong skills (VBA &amp; all functions). The group I'm working for is late but finally decide to take the big data turn and of course Excel is quite limited for this. I have medium knowledge on SQL and Python but I'm far less efficient than with Excel. I have the feeling I need to switch from Excel to Python. For few projects I don't have the choice as Excel just can't handle that much data but for maybe 75% of projects, Excel is enough. </p> <p>If I continue as of today, I'm not progressing on Python and I'm not efficient enough. Do you think I should try to switch everything on Python ? Are there people in the same boat as me and actually did the switch? </p> <p>Thank you for your advice </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vibvib\"> /u/vibvib </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pknn99/from_excel_to_python_transition/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pknn99/from_excel_to_python_transition/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Hybrid KLT\u2014LSTM Tracking for Robust Organ Motion Monitoring in 2D Ultrasound-Guided End-Organ Therapies",
      "content": "Objective: Recent research highlights the potential of ultrasound (US) stimulation as a noninvasive tool for modulating neural and cellular signaling in the spleen and liver to treat inflammatory diseases and diabetes. However, challenges like nerve activation failures, off-target stimulation, and organ motion during respiration can affect treatment efficacy. This study introduces a novel tracking framework for accurate liver and spleen motion tracking using US imaging to overcome these challenges. Methods: The tracking framework integrates an enhanced Kanade\u2013Lucas\u2013Tomasi (EKLT) tracker with a long short-term memory (LSTM) predictor. The EKLT tracker provides precise annotations that improve LSTM training, while the LSTM compensates for occlusions and noise by making predictions based on prior data and dynamically adjusting the region of interest (ROI). Spleen motion tracking was evaluated using 40 recordings from 10 participants, each undergoing four distinct breathing patterns. Additionally, the method was evaluated on a liver motion dataset from MICCAI, collected from 9 subjects. Results: Spleen tracking was most accurate during slow, shallow breathing, with an average error of 0.4 $\\pm$ 0.4 mm, and had an average error of 1.37 $\\pm$ 0.9 mm during fast, deep breathing. Liver tracking results showed high accuracy with an average error of 0.3 $\\pm$ 0.2 mm. Conclusion: The EKLT-LSTM framework offers advantages over previous tracking models, providing high accuracy in tracking liver and spleen motion under occlusion and noisy conditions. Significance: The EKLT-LSTM is suitable for end-organ modulation applications and can be adapted to other ultrasound-guided therapies and bioelectronic medicine.",
