      "title": "GAME-Net: an ensemble deep learning framework integrating Generative Autoencoders and attention mechanisms for automated brain tumor segmentation in MRI",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "High-Fidelity Tuning of Olfactory Mixture Distances in the Perceptual Space of Smell Through a Community Effort",
      "content": "A central goal in sensory science is to establish quantitative mappings between physical stimuli and perceptual responses. While such mappings are well characterized in vision and audition, they remain poorly defined in olfaction, limiting progress toward understanding the representations of smell. Predicting perceptual similarity between odor mixtures offers a promising route to formalize these relationships. To advance this effort, the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Olfactory Mixtures Prediction Challenge assembled a curated, cross-study dataset describing the similarity of 507 mixture pairs and an unpublished test set of 46 mixture pairs. Teams competed to predict the perceptual similarity of mixture pairs, and then collaborated post-challenge to create an ensemble combining top-performing models that notably improves predictions over the existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, ensemble model maintains high predictive accuracy in novel validation set. Our model provides a reproducible framework for neuroscientists, chemists, and engineers to compare odor mixtures and provides a foundation for future efforts towards better understanding the olfactory properties of mixtures.",

      "title": "From labels to latents: revealing state-dependent hippocampal computations with Jump Latent Variable Model",
      "content": "Neural activity is usually interpreted by imposing external labels (e.g., stimuli or position during locomotion) and decoding within that space (e.g. replay). While powerful, such supervision can mask structure in the data that do not correspond to the label. Unsupervised methods, in turn, often assume smooth latent dynamics and miss genuine discontinuities. We introduce a conceptually simple, computationally efficient latent variable model that infers both (i) the latent variables organizing population activity and (ii) whether their dynamics are continuous or fragmented in time. Fitting reduces to an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure that alternates two operations familiar to systems neuroscience--tuning-curve estimation and label decoding--without requiring external labels. Applied to rodent hippocampal spike recordings, the model reveals distinct population patterns at the same physical position that supervised spatial decoding fails to detect. While learned latents exhibit place-field-like tuning, their reactivation patterns are better distinguished by behavioral states. The model further identifies a continuity-fragmentation axis that characterizes population activities across sleep-wake brain states that is modulated by cholinergic inputs. By not relying on externally imposed spatial labels, our approach exposes structure that supervised approaches obscure and provides a powerful tool for datasets lacking behavioral tracking.",

      "title": "Whole-brain connectomics of Drosophila reveals a robust, distributed architecture for the suppression of feeding during escape",
      "content": "Survival demands instant prioritization of escape over maintenance. To decode the dynamic logic embedded in the static Drosophila connectome (FlyWire v783), we simulated the conflict between predator-evasion, feeding, and grooming to uncover the logic of this switch. We show that escape is a holistic state defined by distributed robustness: it is reliably triggered by only a fraction of visual inputs (LC4/LPLC2) and induces a system-wide pause on behaviors like feeding and grooming. Within this global suppression, we identify a specialized, fail-safe architecture for arresting feeding. A redundant ensemble of neurons (DNge031/CB0565) targets the premotor center Roundup, effectively disfacilitating motor output. Crucially, this inhibition is modular, anatomically distinct from grooming suppression, and relies on additive logic to ensure suppression even if individual components fail. Our results demonstrate how connectome topology implements robust, survival-critical control through distributed neural architecture.",

      "content": "Navigation in the real world may rely on a multitude of different strategies with distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, the characterization of spontaneous strategy use during wayfinding and underlying neural correlates are scarce. We explore data across three groups of participants who performed a virtual navigation task: (I) epilepsy patients undergoing invasive electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampus, and two groups who underwent fMRI scanning: (II) young adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (APOE-e4 carriers) and (III) healthy controls. We establish three metrics by which to quantitatively characterize each taken path, with the aim of simultaneously reflecting the putative strategies used by humans to solve the task: 1. straightness of paths; 2. deviation towards the edge of the circular arena; and 3. overlap of individual paths leading to a specific object location, which putatively relate to reliance on allocentric (1) and egocentric reference frames (2 & 3). Extracted metrics were related to performance in the task and to hippocampal activity. We find that strategy use is variable within participant, changes across the experiment, and is adaptive in a group-dependent manner. While hippocampal BOLD activity and theta (gamma) power were generally inversely (positively) related, we found that the recruitment of the hippocampus was both group- and strategy- specific. Our results further our understanding of the heterogeneous and idiosyncratic nature of spatial navigation by revealing how these behaviors are altered by disease and the subsequent compensatory neural dynamics, as well as the link between mesoscopic and macroscopic neural signals.",

      "title": "Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation modulates Pavlovian bias in a state-dependent manner",
      "content": "The vagus nerve transmits vital signals between organ systems of the body and the brain. Despite growing interest in non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) for treatments of various disorders, it is not known whether its modulatory effects on behavior are dependent on bodily states. Here, we used a single-blind randomized crossover design with two within-participant factors, stimulation (right tVNS vs. sham) and metabolic state (water vs. caloric load), to investigate 54 healthy participants (210 sessions). To evaluate state-dependent changes in reinforcement learning, we used a valenced go/no-go task. Performance on this task can be used to estimate a Pavlovian choice bias, which captures improved performance for valence-congruent actions (e.g., go to win rewards) versus valence-incongruent actions (e.g., no-go to win rewards) and has been associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. In line with theorized state-dependency of tVNS-induced changes, we observed that tVNS decreased Pavlovian response biases (Go x Win) after the caloric load (Stimulation x Load: p = .038). Taking into account individual changes in hunger but not satiety ratings best captured behavioral modulation, indicating that this modulatory effect could be driven by motivational effects related to metabolic interoception (sensed \"need\"). We conclude that right tVNS decreases Pavlovian response biases if the body is in a postprandial, but not a fasting state. Since fasting and Pavlovian biases have been previously associated with elevated dopamine neurotransmission, our results call for additional research on state-dependent motivational effects of tVNS to optimize interventions.",

      "title": "Cognitive state dependent enhancement of cognitive control with transcranial magnetic stimulation",
      "content": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet variability of therapeutic responses remains high. A key contributor to this variability may be state-dependent effects of brain stimulation, where activity in underlying circuits can shape the propagation of TMS-evoked activity. Thus, pushing target circuits into a desired state by engaging cognition may sensitise those circuits to TMS-evoked plasticity. We tested whether TMS effects on cognitive control, a transdiagnostic construct implicated across psychiatric disorders and a putative mediator of TMS efficacy, are state-dependent. Participants (N = 25) completed a context-dependent behavioural assay of cognitive control before and after we delivered rTMS to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). During rTMS, participants performed either the cognitive control task (active-state TMS), or performed a context-independent perceptual task (control-state TMS). We assessed changes in downstream behavioural metrics of circuit function, as well as neural indices of cognitive control measured from electroencephalography (EEG). rTMS enhanced cognitive control performance only when PFC-anchored control circuits were actively engaged during stimulation. Similarly, only active-state TMS modulated theta band oscillatory activity, which is thought to be a marker of cognitive control engagement. Moreover, modulation of those EEG indices by TMS predicted gains in behavioural performance in the cognitive control task. These findings demonstrate that TMS effects on cognitive control are state-dependent, in which endogenous engagement of PFC-anchored networks can shape the magnitude and functional relevance of TMS-induced plasticity. Considering cognitive states during TMS may therefore offer a framework to enhance and/or accelerate TMS therapeutic effects.",

      "title": "Neuroinvasion by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Triggers Glial Senescence and Accelerated Neurodegeneration",
      "content": "Virus-induced accelerated aging has emerged as a potential contributor to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), despite widespread implementation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Although evidence of accelerated aging in people living with HIV (PLWH) has been reported, most investigations of acute infection rely on in vitro systems or small animal models, leaving a critical gap in understanding early neuropathological events. To address this, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissues from rhesus macaques acutely infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We focused on two key aging-related proteins: the cellular senescence marker p16INK4a (p16) and the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We hypothesized that accelerated aging phenotypes would be detectable during acute infection, manifesting as increased p16 expression and altered SIRT1 levels, correlating with neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed marked upregulation of GFAP and p16, along with evidence of neurodegeneration, across multiple brain regions - including the frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum - by 21 days post-infection. These findings suggest that aging-related and senescence pathways are activated almost immediately following HIV infection, highlighting the potential importance of astrocyte- or CNS-specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate early neuropathology.",

      "title": "The Overlap Area as a Novel Measure of Effect Size in Neuroscience Research",
      "content": "In experimental biomedical research, a common concern is whether a manipulation produces a biologically meaningful effect. Another concern is whether effect sizes are reliable, statistically significant, and generalizable. Traditional effect size measures, such as Cohens d, quantify mean differences but ignore variance heterogeneity between groups. This can result in biased effect size estimates and a lack of thresholds for statistical significance testing. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel effect size measure, termed overlap area (OA), which quantifies the difference between the population distributions of the experimental and control groups. A robust Bayesian method estimated OA, and random resampling determined OA thresholds for statistical significance in single and replicated experiments. Simulations confirmed the approach's sensitivity and robustness. Applied to a real-world dataset, OA revealed that environmental enrichment affects the mouse brain synaptome. Moreover, we developed an open-source toolbox supporting OA as a powerful new measurement for conducting robust, reliable, and reproducible analyses of manipulation effects in neuroscience and related fields.",
