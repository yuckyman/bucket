      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "content": "Functional parcellations enable reproducible analyses of brain organization, yet the dog fMRI field still lacks a validated, multi-scale functional atlas. We applied spatially constrained spectral clustering to a resting state fMRI dataset (n = 27 dogs) to generate whole-brain parcellations spanning 20-300 parcels. Replicability was evaluated against an independent dataset (n = 20 dogs) using Dice overlap and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) as measures of spatial overlap and similarity; within-parcel functional coherence was assessed via homogeneity. Functional parcellations were anatomically coherent across scales, with global Dice peaking at 0.625 at N = 140 and 0.623 at N = 100, while decreasing to 0.526 at N = 300. ARI peaked at 0.48 for N = 60 and remained [&ge;] 0.46 through N = 180. Mean within-parcel homogeneity increased monotonically from 0.08 (N = 20) to 0.19 (N = 300). Concordance with an anatomical atlas (Johnson et al., 2020) increased at the regional level (plateau ~0.16 for N [&ge;] 140) while diminishing at gyral and lobar levels as resolution increased, consistent with functionally driven sub-regional differentiation. Together, these results indicate functional segmentations that are replicable across datasets and internally coherent across scales, with intermediate resolutions (100-140 parcels) balancing specificity and reproducibility for common analyses. We introduce a comprehensive, multi-scale functional dog brain atlas derived from data-driven clustering, providing an open resource for comparative studies of brain evolution and canine cognition.",
