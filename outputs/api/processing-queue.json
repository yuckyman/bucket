      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "The unexpected dual role of S100A9 amyloid protein on neurodegeneration in progressive multiple sclerosis motor cortex",
      "content": "Motor cortical inflammation and neurodegeneration are key features of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), contributing to irreversible motor disability. However, the precise mechanisms leading to neuronal loss remain poorly understood. While chronic inflammation is a hallmark of MS and contributes to disease progression, the factors linking inflammation to neuronal loss in the cortex are not well defined. One candidate is the calcium-binding protein S100A9, a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein, thought to be released by stressed cells and infiltrating monocytes. Through its ability to modulate immune responses and influence neuronal survival, S100A9 may sustain chronic inflammation and participate in neurodegenerative processes. Although its role has been explored in other neurological disorders, its contribution to progressive MS remains largely uncharacterised. Here, we investigated S100A9 expression in the motor cortex of a large post-mortem cohort of MS cases (n=67) and controls (n=9), focusing on its cellular localisation and its relationship with neuronal density and vascular pathology. S100A9 expression was increased in progressive MS cases compared to controls, predominantly localised to intravascular monocytes and as amyloid-like extracellular plaques surrounding blood vessels. These patterns were associated with neurodegeneration and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, as evidenced by correlations with reduced brain weight, decreased neuronal density, and increased fibrin(ogen) deposition. In contrast, S100A9 was also expressed in microglia, where it correlated with increased neuronal density and reduced fibrin(ogen) deposition. Notably, the phosphorylated form of S100A9, linked to pro-inflammatory signaling, was reduced in microglia but enriched in perivascular regions. These findings reveal a dual, compartment-specific role for S100A9 in progressive MS, whereby extracellular aggregates may drive neurotoxicity, while microglial S100A9 may confer neuroprotection. Therapeutic strategies targeting extracellular S100A9 while preserving its intracellular functions may offer new opportunities for treating progressive MS.",

      "title": "A shared perceptual inference for cross-modally induced illusions of self-attribution.",
      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
