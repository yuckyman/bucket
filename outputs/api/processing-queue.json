      "title": "psiUnity: A Platform for Multimodal Data-Driven XR",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05304v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extended reality (XR) research increasingly relies on the ability to stream and synchronize multimodal data between headsets and immersive applications for data-driven interaction and experimentation. However, developers face a critical gap: the Platform for Situated Intelligence (psi), which excels at deterministic temporal alignment and multimodal data management, has been largely inaccessible to the dominant Unity/MRTK ecosystem used for HoloLens development. We introduce psiUnity, an open-source C# integration that bridges psi's .NET libraries with Unity 2022.3 and MRTK3 for HoloLens 2. psiUnity enables bidirectional, real-time streaming of head pose, hand tracking, gaze, IMU, audio, and depth sensor data (AHAT and long-throw) with microsecond-level temporal precision, allowing Unity applications to both consume and produce synchronized multimodal data streams. By embedding psi's native serialization, logging, and temporal coordination directly within Unity's architecture, psiUnity extends psi beyond its previous StereoKit limitations and empowers the HRI, HCI, and embodied-AI communities to develop reproducible, data-driven XR interactions and experiments within the familiar Unity environment. The integration is available at https://github.com/sailgt/psiUnity.",

      "title": "FM4Com: Foundation Model for Scene-Adaptive Communication Strategy Optimization",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05094v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks heralds an intelligent communication ecosystem driven by AI-native air interfaces. However, current physical-layer designs-typically following modular and isolated optimization paradigms-fail to achieve global end-to-end optimality due to neglected inter-module dependencies. Although large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to communication tasks such as beam prediction and resource allocation, existing studies remain limited to single-task or single-modality scenarios and lack the ability to jointly reason over communication states and user intents for personalized strategy adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multimodal communication decision-making model based on reinforcement learning. The proposed model semantically aligns channel state information (CSI) and textual user instructions, enabling comprehensive understanding of both physical-layer conditions and communication intents. It then generates physically realizable, user-customized link construction strategies that dynamically adapt to changing environments and preference tendencies. A two-stage reinforcement learning framework is employed: the first stage expands the experience pool via heuristic exploration and behavior cloning to obtain a near-optimal initialization, while the second stage fine-tunes the model through multi-objective reinforcement learning considering bit error rate, throughput, and complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms conventional planning-based algorithms under challenging channel conditions, achieving robust, efficient, and personalized 6G link construction.",

With thousands of nodes and edges, sophisticated graph drawing algorithms are required to present them on screens in ways that make them readable and understandable. However, being designed for general graphs, these algorithms frequently break the natural flow of execution, placing later instructions before earlier ones and obscuring critical program structures. In this paper, we introduce a set of criteria specifically tailored for CFG visualization, focusing on preserving execution order and making complex structures easier to follow. Building on these criteria, we present VEIL, a new layout algorithm that uses dominator analysis to produce clearer, more intuitive CFG layouts. Through a study of CFGs from real-world applications, we show how our method improves readability and provides improved layout performance compared to state of the art graph drawing techniques.",

This meta-analysis evaluated the heterogeneity of ITS effects across studies focusing on elementary, middle, and high schools in the U.S. It included 18 studies with 77 effect sizes across 11 ITS. Overall, there was a significant positive effect size of ITS on U.S. K-12 students' learning outcomes (g=0.271, SE=0.011, p=0.001). Furthermore, effect sizes were similar across elementary and middle schools, and for low-achieving students, but were lower in studies including rural schools. A MetaForest analysis showed that providing worked-out examples, intervention duration, intervention condition, type of learning outcome, and immediate measurement were the most important moderators of treatment effects.",

      "title": "Enhancing Public Speaking Skills in Engineering Students Through AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.04995v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This research-to-practice full paper was inspired by the persistent challenge in effective communication among engineering students. Public speaking is a necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication.",

      "title": "Scientific judgment drifts over time in AI ideation",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.04964v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Scientific discovery begins with ideas, yet evaluating early-stage research concepts is a subtle and subjective human judgment. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with generating scientific hypotheses, most systems assume that scientists' evaluations form a fixed gold standard, and that scientists' judgments do not change. Here we challenge this assumption. In a two-wave study with 7,182 ratings from 57 active researchers across six scientific departments, each participant repeatedly evaluated a constant \"control\" research idea alongside AI-generated ideas. We show that scientists' ratings of the very same idea systematically drift over time: overall quality scores increased by 0.61 points on a 0-10 scale (P = 0.005), and test-retest reliability was only moderate across core dimensions of scientific value, revealing systematic temporal drift in perceived idea quality. Yet the internal structure of judgment remained stable, such as the relative importance placed on originality, feasibility, clarity. We then aligned an LLM-based ideation system to first-wave human ratings and used it to select new ideas. Although alignment improved agreement with Wave-1 evaluations, its apparent gains disappeared once drift in human standards was accounted for. Thus, tuning to a fixed human snapshot produced improvements that were transient rather than persistent. These findings reveal that human evaluation of scientific ideas is not static but a dynamic process with stable priorities and requires shifting calibration. Treating one-time human ratings as immutable ground truth risks overstating progress in AI-assisted ideation and obscuring the challenge of co-evolving with changing expert standards. Drift-aware evaluation protocols and longitudinal benchmarks may therefore be essential for building AI systems that reliably augment, rather than overfit to, human scientific judgment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.04391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.",

      "title": "Quantifying Uncertainty in Error Consistency: Towards Reliable Behavioral Comparison of Classifiers",
      "content": "arXiv:2507.06645v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Benchmarking models is a key factor for the rapid progress in machine learning (ML) research. Thus, further progress depends on improving benchmarking metrics. A standard metric to measure the behavioral alignment between ML models and human observers is error consistency (EC). EC allows for more fine-grained comparisons of behavior than other metrics such as accuracy, and has been used in the influential Brain-Score benchmark to rank different DNNs by their behavioral consistency with humans. Previously, EC values have been reported without confidence intervals. However, empirically measured EC values are typically noisy -- thus, without confidence intervals, valid benchmarking conclusions are problematic. Here we improve on standard EC in two ways: First, we show how to obtain confidence intervals for EC using a bootstrapping technique, allowing us to derive significance tests for EC. Second, we propose a new computational model relating the EC between two classifiers to the implicit probability that one of them copies responses from the other. This view of EC allows us to give practical guidance to scientists regarding the number of trials required for sufficiently powerful, conclusive experiments. Finally, we use our methodology to revisit popular NeuroAI-results. We find that while the general trend of behavioral differences between humans and machines holds up to scrutiny, many reported differences between deep vision models are statistically insignificant. Our methodology enables researchers to design adequately powered experiments that can reliably detect behavioral differences between models, providing a foundation for more rigorous benchmarking of behavioral alignment.",

To address this gap, this paper proposes a Three-Layer Cultural Gene Framework that systematically decodes ethnic costumes from their surface-level visual symbols, through their mid-level socio-cultural contexts, to their inner-layer spiritual core. Based on this framework, we designed and implemented an interactive digital platform featuring two key innovations: a \"gene-first\" exploratory path that encourages curiosity-driven discovery, and an AI-powered co-creation experience. This generative feature allows users to co-create personalized narratives and images based on their understanding of the \"inner-layer\" genes, transforming them from passive observers into active co-creators. A mixed-methods user study (N=24) was conducted to evaluate the platform. The findings demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances users' cultural cognition, deepens their affective connection, and significantly promotes their sense of cultural identity. This research contributes a validated framework and a practical exemplar for designing generative, identity-building digital experiences for cultural heritage, offering a new pathway for its preservation and revitalization in the digital age.",

      "title": "Semantic Interactivity: leveraging NLP to enable a shared interaction approach for joint activities",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05346v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Collocated collaboration, where individuals work together in the same physical space and time, remains a cornerstone of effective teamwork. However, most collaborative systems are designed to support individual tasks rather than joint activities; they enable interactions for users to complete tasks rather than interactivity to engage in shared experiences. In this work, we introduce an NLP-driven mechanism that enables semantic interactivity through a shared interaction mechanism. This mechanism was developed as part of CollEagle, an interactive tabletop system that supports shared externalisation practices by offering a low-effort way for users to create, curate, organise, and structure information to capture the essence of collaborative discussions. Our preliminary study highlights the potential for semantic interactivity to mediate group interactions, suggesting that the interaction approach paves the way for designing novel collaborative interfaces. We contribute our implementation and offer insights for future research to enable semantic interactivity in systems that support joint activities.",
