      "title": "Sleep controls peroxisomal abundance to reduce wake-induced brain oxidation",
      "content": "Sleep is increasingly linked to the regulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms underlying this interaction are underexplored. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to report a bidirectional relationship between sleep and peroxisomes, cellular organelles that process lipids and alleviate ROS. Of the genes that change expression after sleep deprivation in the dorsal fan-shaped body, knockdown of the peroxisomal biogenesis factor Pex16 results in decreased sleep. Pex16 acts in several brain regions to modulate sleep amount, with ellipsoid body neurons (EB) producing the highest sleep reduction of the sleep-promoting regions. Consistent with a general role for peroxisomes, knockdown of other peroxisomal enzymes relevant for lipid import and synthesis also decreases sleep. Whole-brain peroxisomal numbers increase with wake, which is supported by lipidomic analysis indicating that peroxisomal-derived phospholipids are the major contributors to phospholipid changes after wake or sleep deprivation. Peroxisomal proliferation in the EB is driven by neuronal activity and increased oxidation, suggesting that these mediate the effect of wake/sleep loss. In turn, peroxisomes alleviate the oxidation accumulated during wake, such that loss of Pex16 in the EB works non-cell autonomously to increase lipid peroxidation brain-wide. This likely contributes to sleep loss, as sleep is rescued with an antioxidant. Together, these results position peroxisomes as key players in sleep, regulating ROS and thereby maintaining normal cycles.",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",
