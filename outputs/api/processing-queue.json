      "title": "Assessing the Human-Likeness of LLM-Driven Digital Twins in Simulating Health Care System Trust",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08939v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Serving as an emerging and powerful tool, Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Human Digital Twins are showing great potential in healthcare system research. However, its actual simulation ability for complex human psychological traits, such as distrust in the healthcare system, remains unclear. This research gap particularly impacts health professionals' trust and usage of LLM-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in assisting their routine work. In this study, based on the Twin-2K-500 dataset, we systematically evaluated the simulation results of the LLM-driven human digital twin using the Health Care System Distrust Scale (HCSDS) with an established human-subject sample, analyzing item-level distributions, summary statistics, and demographic subgroup patterns. Results showed that the simulated responses by the digital twin were significantly more centralized with lower variance and had fewer selections of extreme options (all p<0.001). While the digital twin broadly reproduces human results in major demographic patterns, such as age and gender, it exhibits relatively low sensitivity in capturing minor differences in education levels. The LLM-based digital twin simulation has the potential to simulate population trends, but it also presents challenges in making detailed, specific distinctions in subgroups of human beings. This study suggests that the current LLM-driven Digital Twins have limitations in modeling complex human attitudes, which require careful calibration and validation before applying them in inferential analyses or policy simulations in health systems engineering. Future studies are necessary to examine the emotional reasoning mechanism of LLMs before their use, particularly for studies that involve simulations sensitive to social topics, such as human-automation trust.",

      "title": "The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Strategic Technology Management: A Mixed-Methods Analysis of Resources, Capabilities, and Human-AI Collaboration",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08938v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) can be effectively integrated into Strategic Technology Management (STM) practices to enhance the strategic alignment and effectiveness of technology investments. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative survey data (n=230) and qualitative expert interviews (n=14), this study addresses three critical research questions: what success factors AI innovates for STM roadmap formulation under uncertainty; what resources and capabilities organizations require for AI-enhanced STM; and how human-AI interaction should be designed for complex STM tasks. The findings reveal that AI fundamentally transforms STM through data-driven strategic alignment and continuous adaptation, while success depends on cultivating proprietary data ecosystems, specialized human talent, and robust governance capabilities. The study introduces the AI-based Strategic Technology Management (AIbSTM) conceptual framework, which synthesizes technical capabilities with human and organizational dimensions across three layers: strategic alignment, resource-based view, and human-AI interaction. Contrary to visions of autonomous AI leadership, the research demonstrates that the most viable trajectory is human-centric augmentation, where AI serves as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human judgment. This work contributes to theory by extending the Resource-Based View to AI contexts and addressing cognitive and socio-technical chasms in AI adoption, while offering practitioners a prescriptive framework for navigating AI integration in strategic technology management.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08937v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Seeking advice is a core human behavior that the Internet has reinvented twice: first through forums and Q\\&amp;A communities that crowdsource public guidance, and now through large language models (LLMs) that deliver private, on-demand counsel at scale. Yet the quality of this synthesized LLM advice remains unclear. How does it compare, not only against arbitrary human comments, but against the wisdom of the online crowd? We conducted two studies (N = 210) in which experts compared top-voted Reddit advice with LLM-generated advice. LLMs ranked significantly higher overall and on effectiveness, warmth, and willingness to seek advice again. GPT-4o beat GPT-5 on all metrics except sycophancy, suggesting that benchmark gains need not improve advice-giving. In our second study, we examined how human and algorithmic advice could be combined, and found that human advice can be unobtrusively polished to compete with AI-generated comments. Finally, to surface user expectations, we ran an exploratory survey with undergraduates (N=148) that revealed heterogeneous, persona-dependent preferences for agent qualities (e.g., coach-like: goal-focused structure; friend-like: warmth and humor). We conclude with design implications for advice-giving agents and ecosystems blending AI, crowd input, and expert oversight.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08936v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The incorporation of generative artificial intelligence into personal health applications presents a transformative opportunity for personalized, data-driven health and fitness guidance, yet also poses challenges related to user safety, model accuracy, and personal privacy. To address these challenges, a novel, principle-based framework was developed and validated for the systematic evaluation of LLMs applied to personal health and wellness. First, the development of the Fitbit Insights explorer, a large language model (LLM)-powered system designed to help users interpret their personal health data, is described. Subsequently, the safety, helpfulness, accuracy, relevance, and personalization (SHARP) principle-based framework is introduced as an end-to-end operational methodology that integrates comprehensive evaluation techniques including human evaluation by generalists and clinical specialists, autorater assessments, and adversarial testing, into an iterative development lifecycle. Through the application of this framework to the Fitbit Insights explorer in a staged deployment involving over 13,000 consented users, challenges not apparent during initial testing were systematically identified. This process guided targeted improvements to the system and demonstrated the necessity of combining isolated technical evaluations with real-world user feedback. Finally, a comprehensive, actionable approach is established for the responsible development and deployment of LLM-powered health applications, providing a standardized methodology to foster innovation while ensuring emerging technologies are safe, effective, and trustworthy for users.",

      "title": "From Script to Stage: Automating Experimental Design for Social Simulations with LLMs",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08935v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for social science research. Multi-agent simulations powered by LLMs are increasingly becoming a vital approach for exploring complex social phenomena and testing theoretical hypotheses. However, traditional computational experiments often rely heavily on interdisciplinary expertise, involve complex operations, and present high barriers to entry. While LLM-driven agents show great potential for automating experimental design, their reliability and scientific rigor remain insufficient for widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an automated multi-agent experiment design framework based on script generation, inspired by the concept of the Decision Theater. The experimental design process is divided into three stages: (1) Script Generation - a Screenwriter Agent drafts candidate experimental scripts; (2) Script Finalization - a Director Agent evaluates and selects the final script; (3) Actor Generation - an Actor Factory creates actor agents capable of performing on the experimental \"stage\" according to the finalized script. Extensive experiment conducted across multiple social science experimental scenarios demonstrate that the generated actor agents can perform according to the designed scripts and reproduce outcomes consistent with real-world situations. This framework not only lowers the barriers to experimental design in social science but also provides a novel decision-support tool for policy-making and research.

      "title": "Motion2Meaning: A Clinician-Centered Framework for Contestable LLM in Parkinson's Disease Gait Interpretation",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08934v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI-assisted gait analysis holds promise for improving Parkinson's Disease (PD) care, but current clinical dashboards lack transparency and offer no meaningful way for clinicians to interrogate or contest AI decisions. To address this issue, we present Motion2Meaning, a clinician-centered framework that advances Contestable AI through a tightly integrated interface designed for interpretability, oversight, and procedural recourse. Our approach leverages vertical Ground Reaction Force (vGRF) time-series data from wearable sensors as an objective biomarker of PD motor states. The system comprises three key components: a Gait Data Visualization Interface (GDVI), a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) that predicts Hoehn & Yahr severity stages, and a Contestable Interpretation Interface (CII) that combines our novel Cross-Modal Explanation Discrepancy (XMED) safeguard with a contestable Large Language Model (LLM). Our 1D-CNN achieves 89.0% F1-score on the public PhysioNet gait dataset. XMED successfully identifies model unreliability by detecting a five-fold increase in explanation discrepancies in incorrect predictions (7.45%) compared to correct ones (1.56%), while our LLM-powered interface enables clinicians to validate correct predictions and successfully contest a portion of the model's errors. A human-centered evaluation of this contestable interface reveals a crucial trade-off between the LLM's factual grounding and its readability and responsiveness to clinical feedback. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable sensor analysis with Explainable AI (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, auditable system for PD gait interpretation that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

      "title": "Agentic AI as Undercover Teammates: Argumentative Knowledge Construction in Hybrid Human-AI Collaborative Learning",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08933v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly embedded in collaborative learning environments, yet their impact on the processes of argumentative knowledge construction remains insufficiently understood. Emerging conceptualisations of agentic AI and artificial agency suggest that such systems possess bounded autonomy, interactivity, and adaptability, allowing them to engage as epistemic participants rather than mere instructional tools. Building on this theoretical foundation, the present study investigates how agentic AI, designed as undercover teammates with either supportive or contrarian personas, shapes the epistemic and social dynamics of collaborative reasoning. Drawing on Weinberger and Fischer's (2006) four-dimensional framework, participation, epistemic reasoning, argument structure, and social modes of co-construction, we analysed synchronous discourse data from 212 human and 64 AI participants (92 triads) engaged in an analytical problem-solving task. Mixed-effects and epistemic network analyses revealed that AI teammates maintained balanced participation but substantially reorganised epistemic and social processes: supportive personas promoted conceptual integration and consensus-oriented reasoning, whereas contrarian personas provoked critical elaboration and conflict-driven negotiation. Epistemic adequacy, rather than participation volume, predicted individual learning gains, indicating that agentic AI's educational value lies in enhancing the quality and coordination of reasoning rather than amplifying discourse quantity. These findings extend CSCL theory by conceptualising agentic AI as epistemic and social participants, bounded yet adaptive collaborators that redistribute cognitive and argumentative labour in hybrid human-AI learning environments.",

      "title": "Structural Plasticity as Active Inference: A Biologically-Inspired Architecture for Homeostatic Control",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.",

Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms.

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08942v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Junior indie game developers in distributed, part-time teams lack production frameworks suited to their specific context, as traditional methodologies are often inaccessible. This study introduces the CIGDI (Co-Intelligence Game Development Ideation) Framework, an alternative approach for integrating AI tools to address persistent challenges of technical debt, coordination, and burnout.\n  The framework emerged from a three-month reflective practice and autoethnographic study of a three-person distributed team developing the 2D narrative game \"The Worm's Memoirs\". Based on analysis of development data (N=157 Jira tasks, N=333 GitHub commits, N=13+ Miro boards, N=8 reflection sessions), CIGDI is proposed as a seven-stage iterative process structured around human-in-the-loop decision points (Priority Criteria and Timeboxing).\n  While AI support democratized knowledge access and reduced cognitive load, our analysis identified a significant challenge: \"comprehension debt.\" We define this as a novel form of technical debt where AI helps teams build systems more sophisticated than their independent skill level can create or maintain. This paradox (possessing functional systems the team incompletely understands) creates fragility and AI dependency, distinct from traditional code quality debt.\n  This work contributes a practical production framework for resource-constrained teams and identifies critical questions about whether AI assistance constitutes a learning ladder or a dependency trap for developer skill.",

The methodology employs grid-based discretization and a two-stage computational architecture that separates intensive preprocessing from lightweight real-time calculations. The computational architecture demonstrates that accessibility modelling can be made accessible to non-technical users through interactive interfaces, enabling fine-grained spatial analysis and identification of accessibility variations within neighbourhoods. The research contributes to Sustainable Development Goal 11's vision of inclusive, sustainable cities by providing tools for understanding how different populations experience identical urban spaces, supporting evidence-based policy development that addresses accessibility gaps.",

      "title": "Gene Therapy for Efficient Suppression of T-Type Channels in Treating Diabetic Neuropathy",
      "content": "Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), a chronic and often incurable syndrome, is one of the most common and unpleasant complications of diabetes. Effective clinical interventions for PDN are very limited and already developed approaches are characterized by lack of molecular or cellular target specificity and a short duration of therapeutic effects. Numerous investigations causally link upregulation of the Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels in peripheral nociceptive neurons to painful symptoms of PDN. Here we suggest an approach to alleviate these symptoms based on implementation of virus-mediated cell-specific delivery of vectors expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Processed by Dicer into specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), they would suppress the expression of T-type Ca2+ channels. In order to experimentally validate this approach, we have initially confirmed the ability of designed Dicer-substrate small interfering RNAs (DsiRNAs) to suppress expression of T-type channels in neurons of primary hippocampal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cultures. Target sequences of the effectively interfering DsiRNA were then used to design shRNAs and the coding sequences of shRNAs were cloned into the vector pAAV under U6 promotor. This plasmid was also proved to be effective in interference with expression of the T-type channels in the rat cultured DRG neurons. The expression cassette of this plasmid will be packed into AAV6 particles with tropism to unmyelinated fibers to suppress T-type channel expression in nociceptive DRG neurons and to alleviate painful symptoms of PDN.",

      "title": "Disruption of Striatal Intrinsic Ignition in Huntington's Disease: an In-Silico Perturbational Approach to Emulate Disease Progression and Recovery",
      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a single gene that severely affects motor, cognitive, and behavioral functions and is ultimately fatal. While disruptions in the structural integrity of the striatum are well documented, less is known about how the underlying functional impairments relate to the disease. We developed a large-scale modeling framework based on intrinsic ignition to uncover functional anomalies during HD progression. We first measured how much a spontaneous event in one brain region influences the rest of the brain, then systematically perturbed the activity of the striatum to predict the empirical changes in functional connectivity (FC) by re-optimizing the model parameters and conducting in-silico experiments. Results showed that disruption of the activity dynamics in the caudate, and to some extent the putamen, are the key factors that explain a substantial amount of the variance in FC alterations during HD progression. We then assessed the ability to recover whole-brain functional activity by driving the caudate and putamen activity towards a healthy-like regime and found that, by tuning the local bifurcation parameter of caudate and putamen, it is possible to recover whole-brain healthy functional activity, albeit moderately. Surprisingly, although the functional disruptions in the caudate better explained the alterations in FC, the recovery of the dynamics was more effective in the putamen. Overall, our results suggest that the disruptions of the dynamics in the striatum can explain the gross functional connectivity changes in HD. Our study demonstrates that computational modeling is an important tool to reveal the underlying patterns behind the observed data and provides an opportunity to test interventional mechanisms in silico.",
