      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><pre><code># Mcpwn: Security scanner for Model Context Protocol servers ## What My Project Does Mcpwn is an automated security scanner for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that detects RCE, path traversal, and prompt injection vulnerabilities. It uses semantic detection - analyzing response content for patterns like `uid=1000` or `root:x:0:0` instead of just looking for crashes. **Key features:** - Detects command injection, path traversal, prompt injection, protocol bugs - Zero dependencies (pure Python stdlib) - 5-second quick scans - Outputs JSON/SARIF for CI/CD integration - 45 passing tests **Example:** ```bash python mcpwn.py --quick npx -y u/modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp [WARNING] execute_command: RCE via command [WARNING] Detection: uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) ``` ## Target Audience **Production-ready** for: - Security teams testing MCP servers - DevOps integrating security scans into CI/CD pipelines - Developers building MCP servers who want automated security testing The tool found RCE vulnerabilities in production MCP servers during testing - specifically tool argument injection patterns that manual code review missed. ## Comparison **vs Manual Code Review:** - Manual review missed injection patterns in tool arguments - Mcpwn catches these in 5 seconds with semantic detection **vs Traditional Fuzzers (AFL, libFuzzer):** - Traditional fuzzers look for crashes - MCP vulnerabilities don't crash - they leak data or execute commands - Mcpwn uses semantic detection (pattern matching on responses) **vs General Security Scanners (Burp, OWASP ZAP):** - Those are for web apps with HTTP - MCP uses JSON-RPC over stdio - Mcpwn understands MCP protocol natively **vs Nothing (current state):** - No other automated MCP security testing tools exist - MCP is new (2024-11-05 spec), tooling ecosystem is emerging **Unique approach:** - Semantic detection over crash detection - Zero dependencies (no pip install needed) - Designed for AI-assisted analysis (structured JSON/SARIF output) ## GitHub https://github.com/Teycir/Mcpwn MIT licensed.

      "content": "Mesoscopic brain imaging, enabled by advances in tissue clearing, light-sheet microscopy, and large-scale image processing, allows detailed analysis of cellular and molecular architecture across whole neural circuits. However, applying these methods to postmortem human brain tissue is hindered by strong autofluorescence, high tissue density, and fixation-induced damage. We introduce CleLight, a light-enhanced clearing method that increases tissue transparency while quenching autofluorescence. Combined with complementary chemical treatments, CleLight supports multiplexed immunolabeling and high-resolution imaging of centimeter-thick, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human brain sections. It is compatible with a wide range of antibodies and fluorescent dyes, enabling the visualization of physiological and pathological features across diverse CNS regions in healthy and diseased samples. CleLight offers a simple, robust, and scalable workflow for clearing, deep labeling, and volumetric imaging of human brain tissue. Its compatibility with conventional histology and archival material makes it well suited for organ-wide pathological studies in large patient cohorts and historical brain collections.",

      "title": "Evaluating the effects of regularization and cross-validation parameters on the performance of SVM-based decoding of EEG data",
      "content": "Regularization has been extensively used in multivariate pattern classification (MVPA; decoding) of EEG data to mitigate the risk of overfitting. N-fold cross-validation is also used to mitigate this risk, and it is often combined with averaging across trials to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the impact of different regularization and cross-validation parameters on decoding performance remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of variations in the support vector machine (SVM) regularization parameter (C) and the number of crossfolds (and the number of trials per average) on the performance of SVM-based decoding analyses. To achieve this, we examined the decoding performance in relatively simple binary classification tasks from seven commonly used event-related potential paradigms (N170, mismatch negativity, N2pc, P3b, N400, lateralized readiness potential, and error-related negativity). Additionally, we evaluated the decoding performance in more challenging multiclass tasks, including decoding face identity, facial expression, stimulus location, and stimulus orientation. The results revealed that both decoding accuracy and effect size were highest when the regularization strength was equal to or greater than 1. Furthermore, using between 3 and 5 folds with at least 10 trials per average yielded optimal decoding performance in most cases. Researchers applying SVM-based decoding to datasets similar to those examined here-in terms of population, recording systems, class numbers, and paradigms-might benefit from using the parameters that we found to be optimal here.",

      "content": "The ability to encode and maintain temporal relationships is crucial for learning, predicting, and forming episodic memories. While hippocampal time cells and entorhinal temporal context cells are well-established in vivo, it remains unclear whether single neurons can sustain representations of elapsed time over multi-second intervals, independent of synaptic drive. Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rodent hippocampal CA1 slices under synaptic blockade, we show that following a brief current pulse, many neurons exhibit exponentially decaying firing rates with a broad distribution of time constants extending to tens of seconds. This indicates that single neurons possess intrinsic mechanisms capable of covering behaviorally relevant temporal scales. These results highlight that single neurons can encode temporal information over more than an order of magnitude, providing a potential cellular substrate for temporal coding in the brain.",

      "title": "Systematic comparison of color representations between humans and deep neural networks: towards predicting human color perception in a vast color space",
      "content": "The representational structure of human color perception, particularly within vast color spaces, remains incompletely understood. While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.",

      "title": "Software and pipelines for registration and analyses of rodent brain image data in reference atlas space",
      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just released my new library: BehaveDock. It's a library that simplifies end-to-end testing for containerized applications. Instead of maintaing Docker Compose files, setting ports manually, and managing relevant overhead to start, seed, and teardown the containers, you define your system's components individually along with their interfaces (database, message broker, your microservices) and implement how to provision them.</p> <p>The library handles:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Component orchestration:</strong> Declare your components and their dependencies as type hints, get them and their details wired automatically (port number, username &amp; password, etc.)</li> <li><strong>Lifecycle management:</strong> Setup and teardown handled for you in the correct order</li> <li><strong>Environment swapping:</strong> You can write implementations for any environment (Local docker, staging, bare-metal execution) and your tests don't need to change; they'll use the same interface.</li> </ul> <p>Built for <a href=\"https://behave.readthedocs.io/\">Behave</a>; Uses <a href=\"https://testcontainers-python.readthedocs.io/\">testcontainers-python</a>. Comes with built-in providers for Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Schema Registry.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is aimed at <strong>teams building microservices or monoliths who need reliable E2E tests</strong>.</p> <p>Ideal if you:</p> <ul> <li>Have services that depend on databases, message queues, or other infrastructure</li> <li>Want to run the same test suite against local Docker containers AND staging</li> <li>Are tired of maintaining a separate Docker Compose file just for tests</li> <li>Already use or want to use Behave for BDD-style testing</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p><strong>vs. Docker Compose + pytest:</strong> No external files to maintain. No manual provisioning. Dependencies are resolved in code with proper ordering. Swap from Docker to staging by changing one class; Your behavioral tests are now truly separated from the environment.</p> <p><strong>vs. testcontainers alone:</strong> BehaveDock adds the abstraction layer. You define blueprints (interfaces) and providers (implementations) separately. This means you can mock a database in unit tests, spin up Postgres in CI, and point to a real staging DB in integration\u2014without changing test code.</p> <h1>Repository</h1> <p>I really appreciate any feedback on my work.

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "title": "Early pathogenesis of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy uncovered by human iPSC-derived motor neurons highlights pathogenic neuropeptides as therapeutic targets",
      "content": "Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). Motor neurons (MNs) derived from patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) robustly recapitulated early SBMA phenotypes driven by endogenous mutant AR in the absence of testosterone (dihydrotestosterone) and detectable mutant AR aggregation. Notably, endoplasmic reticulum stress markedly exacerbated SBMA pathology. Cross-species integrative analyses of patient-derived neurons and spinal cords of transgenic mouse models revealed high expression of multiple disease-associated neuropeptides, including urotensin II (UTS2), in patient spinal MNs that was correlated with disease onset and progression in iPSC-derived MNs. Downstream signaling analyses of these neuropeptides revealed convergent molecular pathways whose pharmacological inhibition rescued cellular phenotypes. Together, these results establish a human disease model harboring endogenous mutant AR that closely reproduces early SBMA pathology and provides molecular leads for elucidating disease mechanisms and biomarkers and developing therapeutic targets.",
