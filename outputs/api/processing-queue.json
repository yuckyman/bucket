      "title": "A Survey on Tactile Change Blindness",
      "content": "While vibrotactile displays continue to gain popularity, it remains that the phenomenon of tactile change blindness negatively impacts the human ability to detect changes between and within tactile signals. This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

      "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
      "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

      "content": "Neuronal activity robustly engages the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway through Calcium-dependent mechanisms; however, whether ERK can acutely and causally modulates ongoing neuronal activity remains unsolved due to complex upstream regulation and diverse subcellular functions. Here, we directly address this question using an optogenetic ERK activator, opto-miniRaf, that enables selective, rapid, graded, and reversible control of ERK signaling. Combining this AAV-compatible system with calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we interrogate ERK functions across biological scales, from cultured neurons, acute brain slices, and the intact brain. Acute optogenetic activation of ERK enhances synchronized network burst activity in cultured rat cortical neurons and increases calcium activity of cortical pyramidal neurons in awake and moving mice following non-invasive light stimulation. Together, these results establish ERK signaling as an acute modulator of neuronal and network activity, positioning opto-miniRaf as a generalizable platform for precise spatiotemporal control of intracellular kinase signaling in complex biological systems.",

      "title": "Linguistic information compensates for age-related decline in attentional filtering",
      "content": "As we age, understanding speech in social situations imposes an increasingly difficult challenge to the auditory system. However, the attentional mechanisms underlying age-related speech comprehension difficulties in multitalker situations remain unclear. We collected EEG signals while 63 normal hearing participants from 19 to 71 years performed a speech comprehension task involving a multitalker paradigm at individually adjusted target-to-distractor ratios. Combining trial-resolved multivariate temporal response function modeling with detailed behavioral comprehension responses, we provide a window into lower-level impairments and higher-level compensatory mechanisms across the adult life span. Neuro-behavioral correlations on a trial-by-trial level provide direct evidence for increased distractor representation underlying reduced behavioral performance in late adulthood. This points towards increased distractability as a potential mechanism underlying age-related speech comprehension deficits. Additionally, at the behavioral and neural levels, we show that older adults relied more on higher-level linguistic information. Finally, we show that an increased reliance on linguistic information may serve as a compensatory mechanism that supports comprehension performance across the adult life span. Summarizing, combining behavioral and neural data, we directly show that an increased reliance on linguistic processing can offset age-related impairments in attentional filtering.",

      "title": "Claustral Input Consolidates Anterior Cingulate Cortical States for Selective Behavior",
      "content": "Efficient behavior depends on consolidating selective strategies that prioritize informative cues and suppress irrelevant signals. Previous studies have implicated the claustrum in coordinating cortical activity and large-scale brain states across behavioral contexts, yet its precise contribution to online behavioral control versus the consolidation of frontal control strategies remains unresolved. Here we combined large-scale Neuropixels recordings with targeted optogenetic perturbation of claustral neurons projecting to the anterior cingulate cortex in behaving mice. During adaptation to altered task context and constraints, frontal cortical activity reorganized into a coordinated control regime characterized by sharpened encoding of task-relevant cues, suppression of non-instructive signals, structured low-frequency dynamics, and rapid transitions between population-level neural states. Temporally misaligned claustral signaling disrupted this reorganization, selectively impairing the consolidation of efficient, cue-selective strategies across sessions without affecting trial-by-trial task execution. These findings identify a role for the claustrum in shaping frontal dynamics that consolidate adaptive control strategies.",

      "title": "Hierarchical processing and polarization encoding in the cephalopod visual system",
      "content": "Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, cuttlefish, and squid; hereafter \"cephalopods\") have evolved a range of complex visually guided behaviors, from dexterous hunting to skin pattern based camouflage and communication (1). They have also evolved sensitivity to the polarization of light (2), an adaptation thought to help detect camouflaged or semitransparent predators and prey in low-visibility underwater environments (3-10). How visual information is processed by the cephalopod brain to support these behaviors remains unclear. Here, studying the bigfin reef squid Sepioteuthis lessoniana, we performed calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings from populations of neurons in the large visual center of the cephalopod brain, the optic lobe (OL). We found that the retina-recipient superficial OL contains a diversity of functionally distinct cell types, spatially organized into sublayers, that process spatiotemporal features of light intensity and exhibit polarization angle selectivity. More complex features, such as direction selectivity, are observed in deeper regions of the OL cortex, which also exhibit spontaneous waves of neural activity in the absence of visual input. Neurons in the downstream OL medulla exhibit visual receptive field sizes and spontaneous activity levels that increase with brain depth, consistent with hierarchical processing of visual information through the medulla's tree-like anatomical organization. Medulla neurons show sensitivity to local decreases in the degree of linear polarization (DoLP), which are integrated additively with light intensity information. Underwater imaging in the squid's natural habitat off the coast of Okinawa, Japan, demonstrates that polarization sensitivity provides a robust short-range increase in object-background contrast across a range of objects and environmental conditions. Together, these findings reveal convergent principles of hierarchical visual processing shared between cephalopods and vertebrates, and highlight how cephalopods exploit polarization sensitivity to solve fundamental visual challenges in underwater environments.",

      "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

      "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
      "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

      "title": "HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface With Hierarchical Force Control",
      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "title": "\u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d: Studying the Influence of Vibration Parameters on Speech Persuasion",
      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",
