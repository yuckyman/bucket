      "title": "Do Teachers Dream of GenAI Widening Educational (In)equality? Envisioning the Future of K-12 GenAI Education from Global Teachers' Perspectives",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.10782v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly entering K-12 classrooms worldwide, initiating urgent debates about its potential to either reduce or exacerbate educational inequalities. Drawing on interviews with 30 K-12 teachers across the United States, South Africa, and Taiwan, this study examines how teachers navigate this GenAI tension around educational equalities. We found teachers actively framed GenAI education as an equality-oriented practice: they used it to alleviate pre-existing inequalities while simultaneously working to prevent new inequalities from emerging. Despite these efforts, teachers confronted persistent systemic barriers, i.e., unequal infrastructure, insufficient professional training, and restrictive social norms, that individual initiative alone could not overcome. Teachers thus articulated normative visions for more inclusive GenAI education. By centering teachers' practices, constraints, and future envisions, this study contributes a global account of how GenAI education is being integrated into K-12 contexts and highlights what is required to make its adoption genuinely equal.",

      "title": "Bridging Cultural Distance Between Models Default and Local Classroom Demands: How Global Teachers Adopt GenAI to Support Everyday Teaching Practices",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.10780v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly entering K-12 classrooms, offering teachers new ways for teaching practices. Yet GenAI models are often trained on culturally uneven datasets, embedding a \"default culture\" that often misaligns with local classrooms. To understand how teachers navigate this gap, we defined the new concept Cultural Distance (the gap between GenAI's default cultural repertoire and the situated demands of teaching practice) and conducted in-depth interviews with 30 K-12 teachers, 10 each from South Africa, Taiwan, and the United States, who had integrated AI into their teaching practice. These teachers' experiences informed the development of our three-level cultural distance framework. This work contributes the concept and framework of cultural distance, six illustrative instances spanning in low, mid, high distance levels with teachers' experiences and strategies for addressing them. Empirically, we offer implications to help AI designers, policymakers, and educators create more equitable and culturally responsive GenAI tools for education.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.10776v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Modern social media feeds use predictive models to maximize engagement, often misaligning how people consume content with how they wish to. We introduce Bonsai, a system that enables people to build personalized and intentional feeds. Bonsai implements a platform-agnostic framework comprising Planning, Sourcing, Curating, and Ranking modules. Altogether, this framework allows users to express their intent in natural language and exert fine-grained control over a procedurally transparent feed creation process. We evaluated the system with 15 Bluesky users in a two-phase, multi-week study. We find that participants successfully used our system to discover new content, filter out irrelevant or toxic posts, and disentangle engagement from intent, but curating intentional feeds required participants to exert more effort than they are used to. Simultaneously, users sought system transparency mechanisms to trust and effectively use intentional, personalized feeds. Overall, our work highlights intentional feedbuilding as a viable path beyond engagement-based optimization.",

Our system transforms the built-in speaker, the only transducer common to all hearables, into an acoustic sensor that captures the coarse \"lub-dub\" heart sounds, leverages their shared temporal and spectral structure to reconstruct the subtle seismocardiography (SCG) and gyrocardiography (GCG) waveforms, and extract the timing of key micro-cardiac events. In an IRB-approved feasibility study with 18 users, our system achieves correlations of 0.88-0.95 compared to chest-mounted reference measurements in within-user and cross-user evaluations, and generalizes to unseen hearables using a zero-effort adaptation scheme with a correlation of 0.91. Our system is robust across remounting sessions and music playback.",

We present Unbounded, a Research through Design inquiry into Object-Boundary Interactions (OBIs). Building on prior work, we articulate a design space aimed at providing a shared language for OBIs. To demonstrate its potential, we design and implement eight examples across productivity and art exploration scenarios, showcasing how boundaries can enrich and reframe everyday interactions. We further engage with six MR experts in one-on-one feedback sessions, using the design space and examples as design probes. Their reflections broaden the conceptual scope of OBIs, reveal new possibilities for how the framework may be applied, and highlight implications for future MR interaction design.",

Our laboratory, which is realized as a web application, enables researchers to show pre-recorded or live video feeds to groups of users in a synchronized fashion. Users are able to provide real-time feedback on these videos via affect buttons and a freeform chat interface. We evaluate our application via a quantitative user study ($N \\approx 80$) involving videos of cyber-physical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, performing positively or negatively. Using data collected from user responses in the application, as well as customized survey instruments assessing different facets of trust, we find that human trust in cyber-physical systems can be affected merely by remotely observing the behavior of such systems, without ever encountering them in person.",

We show trends in math and science teacher adoption of GenAI, including frequency and purpose of use. We describe how teachers use GenAI with students and their beliefs about GenAI's impact on student learning. We share teachers' reporting on the school and district support they are receiving for GenAI learning and implementation, and the support they would like schools and districts to provide, and close with implications for policy, practice, and research. Given the rapid pace of GenAI development and growing pressure on schools to integrate emerging technologies, these findings offer timely insights into how frontline educators are navigating this shift in practice.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.10723v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The dark patterns, deceptive interface designs manipulating user behaviors, have been extensively studied for their effects on human decision-making and autonomy. Yet, with the rising prominence of LLM-powered GUI agents that automate tasks from high-level intents, understanding how dark patterns affect agents is increasingly important. We present a two-phase empirical study examining how agents, human participants, and human-AI teams respond to 16 types of dark patterns across diverse scenarios. Phase 1 highlights that agents often fail to recognize dark patterns, and even when aware, prioritize task completion over protective action. Phase 2 revealed divergent failure modes: humans succumb due to cognitive shortcuts and habitual compliance, while agents falter from procedural blind spots. Human oversight improved avoidance but introduced costs such as attentional tunneling and cognitive load. Our findings show neither humans nor agents are uniformly resilient, and collaboration introduces new vulnerabilities, suggesting design needs for transparency, adjustable autonomy, and oversight.",

Despite rapid adoption, little research has examined how vibe coding reconfigures UX workflows and collaboration. Drawing on interviews with 20 UX professionals across enterprises, startups, and academia, we show how vibe coding follows a four-stage workflow of ideation, AI generation, debugging, and review. This accelerates iteration, supports creativity, and lowers barriers to participation. However, professionals reported challenges of code unreliability, integration, and AI over-reliance. We find tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping (\"intending the right design\") and reflection (\"designing the right intention\"), introducing new asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams. Through the lens of responsible human-AI collaboration for AI-assisted UX design and development, we contribute a deeper understanding of deskilling, ownership and disclosure, and creativity safeguarding in the age of vibe coding.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.10637v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to promote prosocial and constructive discourse online. Yet little is known about how they negotiate and shape underlying values when reframing people's arguments on value-laden topics. We conducted experiments with 347 participants from India and the United States, who wrote constructive comments on homophobic and Islamophobic threads, and reviewed human-written and LLM-rewritten versions of these comments. Our analysis shows that LLM systematically diminishes Conservative values while elevating prosocial values such as Benevolence and Universalism. When these comments were read by others, participants opposing same-sex marriage or Islam found human-written comments more aligned with their values, whereas those supportive of these communities found LLM-rewritten versions more aligned with their values. These findings suggest that LLM-driven value homogenization can shape how diverse viewpoints are represented in contentious debates on value-laden topics and may influence the dynamics of online discourse critically.",
