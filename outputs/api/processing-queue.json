      "title": "Repetitive Hibernation-Like State Suppresses the Progression of Amyloid Pathology",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to exhibit amyloid pathology years before the onset of cognitive impairment. While early detection and pathological modification are considered essential for suppressing or preventing disease progression, effective strategies remain elusive. Here, we investigated whether inducing a hibernation-like state via Q neuron-induced hypometabolism/hypothermia state (QIH) suppresses the progression of early amyloid pathology in AD model mice. To maximize the total duration of QIH, we established and implemented a repetitive QIH (rQIH) protocol. Using 82E1 antibody immunostaining, we found that rQIH significantly reduced early amyloid plaque burden, and the magnitude of this suppression was positively correlated with rQIH duration. rQIH also decreased the formation of dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. These findings demonstrate that a hibernation-like physiological state can attenuate early amyloid pathology, providing a potential foundation for future hibernation-based therapeutic strategies for AD.",

      "title": "Spatial and temporal contexts drive visual temporal integration via spatiotemporal normalisation",
      "content": "The visual system is known to integrate sensory information across both space and time, but these dimensions are often studied separately. Here we provide novel behavioural evidence for an early integration over space and time, and propose a computational model of this integration that is biologically plausible. We designed a controlled task that forces human participants to integrate information over both space and time to perform well. Stimuli were temporally segmented rings of oriented elements and participants had to detect a missing element in the ring. We found that temporal integration was enhanced when successive visual events were temporally proximate, spatially aligned to form a continuous contour, but also, and more surprisingly, when they were brief. Notably, the spatial effects on integration are temporally asymmetric: integration is facilitated when more events are presented earlier in the sequence, and even more so when they form a collinear contour. These findings indicate that temporal integration is sensitive to both the spatial configuration and the number of visual events presented over time, supporting a continuous rather than discrete process at early visual stages. All of these results are well accounted for by a computational model in which temporal integration arises from the overlap of internal signals generated by individual visual events. These signals are shaped by a spatially and temporally tuned divisive normalisation mechanism and integrated via coincidence detection. Predictions from this model match human performance in seminal past work as well as novel stimulus displays, offering an account of how spatio temporal interactions determine what we perceive and when.",

      "title": "Cortical spectral rebalancing underlies pregabalin's efficacy in restless legs syndrome",
      "content": "Restless legs syndrome afflicts nearly half of all patients with end-stage renal disease, imposing profound burdens through relentless insomnia and functional decline. Dopaminergic agents--the established first-line therapy--trigger augmentation, a paradoxical intensification of symptoms that leaves patients worse than when they began treatment. The resultant therapeutic impasse has left a vulnerable population without effective recourse. Here we demonstrate that pregabalin, an alpha2delta; calcium channel ligand with established renal safety, provides robust and sustained symptom relief in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of dialysis patients with uremic restless legs syndrome. Clinical benefits emerged rapidly and intensified over three months, with pregabalin-treated patients showing more than twofold greater likelihood of categorical improvement in disease severity. In complementary animal electrophysiology experiments, pregabalin distinctively suppressed cortical hyperarousal--a hallmark of restless legs syndrome--by rebalancing low- and high-frequency oscillatory activity patterns, particularly in motor regions. This neural signature closely resembled that of gabapentin, another therapeutically effective alpha2delta ligand, suggesting convergent mechanisms. Beyond establishing pregabalin as an urgently needed alternative to dopaminergic therapy, our results demonstrate that cortical oscillatory profiling can reveal mechanistic convergence among candidate therapeutics, offering a rational preclinical screening strategy for neurological disorders before exposure of high-risk patient populations to experimental interventions. This framework may accelerate therapeutic discovery while reducing clinical trial risks in vulnerable populations.",
