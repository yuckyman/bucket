      "title": "The interaction between aging and DNA damage influences the accumulation of APP in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "DNA damage is a major driver of the aging process. The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) worsens the situation as evidenced by the finding that the neurons of the AD brain have elevated levels of DNA damage. AD is also associated with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) known for its proteolytic peptide fragment, A{beta}. In the current work we find that these three elements - age, DNA damage, and APP - are associated with each other and present evidence in the mouse brain supporting the hypothesis that DNA damage is the likely cause of the increased APP levels. Using the TUNEL reaction to track DNA damage, we show that the TUNEL staining increases significantly with age (6 months to 24 months). Next, we used immunostaining of intracellular APP to show that it too increases over this same time period. To separate correlation from causality we repeated these analyses using tissue from mice genetically deficient in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase, an enzyme associated with part of the DNA damage repair mechanism. TUNEL signal in neurons of 6-month Atm-/- animals was equivalent to that seen in 24-month wild type. Significantly, the APP signal in the Atm-/- cells increased in consort and the relationship between DNA damage and APP was found in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells. These results suggest that the loss of genomic integrity associated with aging is a cellular stressor that increases the levels of APP and thus increases vulnerability to the pathogenesis of AD.",

      "title": "MiR-34a deficiency enhances nucleic acid sensing and type I IFN signaling in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "MiR-34a is implicated in aging, cell senescence, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to investigate the role of miR-34a in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we produced an AD mouse model, Tg-SwDI mice, with whole body/constitutive miR-34a knockout (KO). MiR-34a KO improved long-term memory in Tg-SwDI mice, which was associated with decreases in the ratio of insoluble A{beta}42 to A{beta}40 and with increases in soluble and insoluble A{beta}40 in the cerebral cortex. Anti-Iba1 immunofluorescence revealed increases in activated microglia. Bulk RNA-sequencing of the hippocampus followed by a gene set enrichment analysis (Enrichr) identified '' cellular response to type I interferon '' and '' type I interferon signaling pathway'' as the most prominent gene sets in miR-34a KO Tg-SwDI mice compared to miR-34a wild-type Tg-SwDI mice. Many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that characterize interferon responsive microglia (IRM) were upregulated in miR-34a KO Tg-SwDI mice. MiR-34a knockdown strongly enhanced ISGs expression in TLR7 ligand-stimulated BV2 microglia. These results suggest that miR-34a inhibits the transition of microglia to the IRM state that may modulate synaptic and cognitive functions in neurodegenerative diseases and aging.",

      "title": "Interactions of the LINE-1 encoded ORF1p with proteins and chromatin converge on a role in neuronal physiology",
      "content": "Retrotransposons are emerging as novel regulators of embryonic and brain development. We recently demonstrated that the LINE-1 encoded protein ORF1p is abundantly expressed in adult mouse and human neurons, although its function remains unclear. Here, we characterize the ORF1p interactome in differentiated mouse and human neurons using mass spectrometry and identify novel partners implicated in gene regulation and neuron-specific processes. ORF1p localizes not only to neuronal nuclei, where it associates with chromatin under steady-state conditions, but also to neurites, supporting a role in neuronal physiology. To further explore its nuclear functions, we sorted human post-mortem neurons with high or low nuclear ORF1p levels and performed ORF1p knockdown in cultured human neurons, followed by chromatin accessibility assays. Both approaches revealed consistent patterns of differential chromatin accessibility dependent on ORF1p. Loss of ORF1p also led to the downregulation of long, neuron-specific genes and altered neurite morphology. Together, these findings point to a physiological role of ORF1p in post-mitotic neurons, mediated through converging interactions with proteins and chromatin.",
