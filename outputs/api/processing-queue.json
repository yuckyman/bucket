      "title": "Regional heterogeneity shapes macroscopic wave dynamics of the human and non-human primate cortex",
      "content": "Growing evidence indicates that macroscopic cortical activity is dominated by propagating waves of excitation. However, many computational models of such wave dynamics assume that the cortex is a spatially homogeneous medium, ignoring the rich regional variations in cellular, molecular, and physiological properties that are known to shape how brain activity evolves through both space and time. Here, we develop a general framework grounded in neural field theory to model how regional heterogeneities in diverse cortical properties shape spatiotemporal brain activity evolving on cortical surface meshes. This enables high resolution, vertex-level simulations without requiring predefined parcellations. The model requires only a standard mesh model of the cortical manifold and a spatial heterogeneity map, providing a biologically grounded and computationally efficient framework that can be generalised to human and non-human species. Using multiple cellular, molecular, and physiological maps in humans--and analogous maps in macaques and marmosets--we show that our model can consistently recapitulate known relationships between regional heterogeneities and variations in cortical wave speed. In particular, we find that models parameterised by heterogeneities in intracortical myelin and excitation-inhibition balance yield the largest performance improvements relative to spatially homogeneous models. Our results identify a key role for regional variations in myelin, receptor, and genetic architecture in shaping the spatial patterning of macroscale cortex-wide activity that is conserved across primate species with diverse cortical geometries.",

      "title": "An event-based opto-tactile skin",
      "content": "This paper presents a neuromorphic, event-driven tactile sensing system for soft, large-area skin, based on the Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) integrated with a flexible silicone optical waveguide skin. Instead of repetitively scanning embedded photoreceivers, this design uses a stereo vision setup comprising two DVS cameras looking sideways through the skin. Such a design produces events as changes in brightness are detected, and estimates press positions on the 2D skin surface through triangulation, utilizing Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to find the center of mass of contact events resulting from pressing actions. The system is evaluated over a 4,620 mm probed area of the skin using a meander raster scan. Across 95 % of the presses visible to both cameras, the press localization achieved a Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.66 mm. The results highlight the potential of this approach for wide-area flexible and responsive tactile sensors in soft robotics and interactive environments. Moreover, we examined how the system performs when the amount of event data is strongly reduced. Using stochastic down-sampling, the event stream was reduced to 1/1,024 of its original size. Under this extreme reduction, the average localization error increased only slightly (from 4.66 mm to 9.33 mm), and the system still produced valid press localizations for 85 % of the trials. This reduction in pass rate is expected, as some presses no longer produce enough events to form a reliable cluster for triangulation. These results show that the sensing approach remains functional even with very sparse event data, which is promising for reducing power consumption and computational load in future implementations. The system exhibits a detection latency distribution with a characteristic width of 31 ms.",
