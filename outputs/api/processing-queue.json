      "title": "Peri-operative pregabalin does not adversely impact experimentaloutcomes in rat models of chronic pain",
      "content": "Introduction: Multiple mechanisms contribute to the experience of pain where the use of model organisms to dissect mechanistically sensory regulatory circuitry is a vital component of discovering underlying causes of persistent pain in disease states. Such disease states can be modelled in animals using surgical procedures that, ethically, should involve administration of analgesia. However, since basic pain researchers often wish to measure pain-related events, animals may be denied peri-operative analgesia to avoid adversely influencing experimental outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peri-operative analgesia usage in rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) models. Using a combination of behavioural testing and in vivo electrophysiology in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, we assessed the impact of peri-operative pregabalin on nociceptive behaviours in the acute recovery phase, and behavioural and electrophysiological experimental outcomes in the chronic phase, of rat SNL and CIBP models. Results: A literature search revealed that, for studies using rat models of SNL or CIBP, only 5.37 % and 12.69 % respectively reported the use of peri-operative analgesia. We then demonstrated that the use of pregabalin as a peri-operative analgesic reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in the acute period following SNL surgery, with no impact on behavioural, electrophysiological or neuropharmacological outcomes in the chronic phase of either model. Conclusions: This study challenges the basic science researcher's reasoning that peri-operative analgesia confounds neurobiological outcomes. The use of peri-operative analgesia should be an important consideration to improve animal welfare in chronic models of pain.",

      "title": "Neuronal activity promotes repair by microglial reprogramming following demyelination",
      "content": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a multifaceted role in neurological disorders. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease, microglia contribute to inflammation and tissue damage, but can also support repair by clearing myelin debris, limiting inflammation and promoting remyelination and neuroprotection. The timely transition from their pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative states is essential for effective repair and, in chronic MS, persistent, defective microglial activation contributes to disease progression. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the microglial switch remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal activity can modulate microglial signature at the onset of remyelination in MS models, in a pattern-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a downregulation of pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial signatures alongside an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, indicative of a shift toward pro-regenerative states following physiological activity enhancement. This activity-dependent reprogramming also extends to infiltrating monocytes and macrophages, collectively fostering a microenvironment favoring repair.",

      "title": "The transcription factor BCL11A restores differentiation potential to aged oligodendrocyte progenitor cells",
      "content": "In young animals, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) undergo robust differentiation, progressing through stages to become pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (Pre-OL) and ultimately myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). However, OPCs from aged animals have reduced differentiation ability. This disrupts myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a lack of remyelination following demyelinating injury and impaired adaptive myelination as a mechanism of learning. To uncover novel factors essential for restoring resilience in aged OPCs, we employed a data-driven approach involving the development of a computational pipeline, gSWITCH (accessible at: https://altoslabs.shinyapps.io/gSWITCH/), that allows for capture of precise dynamic gene expression patterns to pinpoint potential 'switch' genes during lineage progression. Using gSWITCH to identify potential switch genes crucial for OPCs, we conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in OPCs isolated from young and aged animals. This revealed a group of transcription factors with decreased expression in aged OPCs. Further analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment in OPC switches highlighted Bcl11a, a zinc finger transcription factor that could potentially serve as a master regulator of many switch genes. Ectopic overexpression of Bcl11a in aged OPCs did not enhance their proliferation; however, it significantly enhanced their differentiation into OLs. Overexpression of Bcl11a in aged mice, followed by demyelination injury in spinal cord white matter, significantly increased the differentiation of OPCs into OLs within the injury region compared to control aged mice. Furthermore, we found that Bcl11a is absent in invertebrates and has undergone pervasive purifying selection throughout vertebrate evolution, constraining its amino-acid sequence by eliminating deleterious mutations. Our study shows that reversing the age-related decline of this evolutionarily conserved factor in aged OPCs restores their impaired capacity for differentiation.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "title": "The Virtual Brain Ontology: A Digital Knowledge Framework for Reproducible Brain Network Modeling",
      "content": "Computational models of brain network dynamics offer mechanistic insights into brain function and disease, and are utilized for hypothesis generation, data interpretation, and the creation of personalized digital brain twins. However, results remain difficult to reproduce and compare because equations, parameters, networks, and numerical settings are reported inconsistently across the literature, and shared code is often not fully documented, standardized, or executable. We introduce *The Virtual Brain Ontology* (TVB-O), a semantic knowledge base, minimal metadata standard, and Python toolbox that simplifies the description, execution, and sharing of network simulations. TVB-O offers 1) a common vocabulary and ontology for core concepts and axioms representing current domain knowledge for simulating brain network dynamics, 2) a minimal, human- and machine-readable metadata specification for the information needed to reproduce an experiment, 3) a curated database of published models, brain networks, and study configurations, and 4) software that generates executable code for various simulation platforms and programming languages, including The Virtual Brain, Jax, or Julia. FAIR metadata and provenance-aware reports can be exported from TVB-O's model specification. It hereby enables a flexible framework for adopting new models and enhances reproducibility, comparability, and portability across simulators, while making assumptions explicit and linking models to biomedical knowledge and observation pathways. By reducing technical barriers and standardizing workflows, TVB-O broadens access to computational neuroscience and establishes a foundation for transparent, shareable \"digital brain twins\" that integrate with clinical pipelines and large-scale data resources.",

      "title": "Independent Basal Ganglia Neural Populations Encode Speech Production and Ambient-Noise Levels",
      "content": "The function of the basal ganglia (BG), a set of nuclei deep in the brain, is still under debate despite their clinical relevance. Lines of evidence from non-human primate and human experiments suggest that one key causal contribution of the adult primate BG is invigoration of movement according to environmental and energetic constraints. Previous studies have come to this conclusion using primarily limb motor control tasks. We hypothesized BG are also important for invigorating the respiratory, vocal, and articulatory motor systems during speech production. To test this, we used a rare clinical opportunity to record local field potentials-broadband gamma activity (LFP-BGA) and single unit (SU) activity from human basal ganglia during deep brain stimulation implant surgeries. Participants repeated sentences aloud in the operating room. We modulated environmental and energetic constraints of speech production by inducing the Lombard Effect, wherein people reliably increase the intensity of their voice in the presence of background noise. Participants increased voice intensity, pitch, vowel space size, and respiratory depth in the presence of ambient noise. ~40% of LFP and SU sites were modulated by speech production. Comparing globus pallidus (GP) LFP-BGA, herein reported for the first time during speech, to subthalamic nucleus (STN) LFP-BGA revealed GP activated after STN. STN was more coincident with the speech preparatory period and GP more coincident with speech onset, suggesting differential roles in speech production. We found only weak evidence that STN or GP activity encodes the level of produced speech intensity. Instead, we found that LFP-BGA and SU-FR robustly track the ambient background noise levels. Linear decoding from SU-firing rate revealed we could infer the background noise levels with >75% accuracy in any given time point in the trial, including baseline. Importantly, the ambient-noise-modulated sites were an independent population from speech-modulated sites. We conclude that human BG encode the energetic constraints of communication. We theorize that the code is leveraged in downstream BG-cortical loop nodes to invigorate speech oro-motor gestures and co-speech manual limb gestures, both of which respond to ambient noise levels to maintain high-fidelity communication.",
