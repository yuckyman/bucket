      "title": "Medtronic Percept\u2122 recorded LFP pre-processing to remove noise and cardiac signals from neural recordings",
      "content": "Chronic brain sensing devices, such as the Medtronic Percept\u2122 or Neuropace RNS system, record local field potentials (LFPs) that may be vulnerable to interference and noise due to hardware limitations, environmental factors, movement, stimulation, cardiac signals, and analytical procedures. Although onboard hardware filters can attenuate some unwanted signals, additional processing is often required. Here we demonstrate that cardiac artifacts significantly alter the power spectral density (PSD) of neural activity within the theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (8\u201312 Hz), and beta (12\u201330 Hz) bands. We introduce a time-domain template subtraction method specifically designed to remove QRS complex cardiac artifacts. Separately, we describe techniques for transforming time domain data to the frequency domain and mitigating transient artifacts by estimating background neural activity\u2014either through window rejection based on PSD characteristics or via principal component analysis. Finally, we present an approach to isolate oscillatory neural activity by subtracting the aperiodic 1/f component from the power spectrum by fitting the fitting oscillations and one over F logarithmic function. While filter selection must be tailored to the specific device and participant environment to avoid over-filtering, these interference and noise mitigation strategies are crucial for ensuring the integrity of LFP recordings.",

      "title": "The hands of time: Moving my body to keep time order in the brain",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.16616v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The brain is very often viewed as a network, be it at small scale made of cells, mostly neurons, or at larger scale made of neuronal assemblies. Here we introduce a conjecture, in the spirit of a philosophical though experiment, which proposes that the present cannot be obtained from within such networks, and that this limitation imposes burdens on network efficiency in information processing. We aim to argue this conjecture imposes recurrent contacts from within the brain to outside in the physical world via behavior, which create a flow of time stamps. This though experiment may contribute to make the divide between the foci toward inside versus outside, for example opposing ecological psychology and many frameworks adopted in neurosciences, superfluous. This piece proposes an ambulation triggered by a thought experiment: What if I was a neuron listening to another one and talking to a third? It is a modest attempt to walk in the footsteps of classical thought experiments, like Molyneux problem, the imitation game and the anti-sequel Chinese room, key gedankenexperiments in an elevator in physics, or the cogito in philosophy.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "Enhancing SSVEP-BCI performance through multi-stimulus discriminant fusion analysis",
      "content": "Objective. To enhance frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), particularly under short data acquisition and complex environmental conditions. Approach. We propose multi-stimulus discriminant fusion analysis (MSDFA), a novel method that integrates multi-stimulus strategies with discriminant modeling. MSDFA was evaluated on two public datasets (Benchmark and BETA) and compared with conventional approaches including eCCA, eTRCA, and their variants. Main results. MSDFA consistently outperformed existing methods across different data lengths and training block quantities. It achieved maximum information transfer rates of 247.17\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15\u2009bpm on the Benchmark dataset and 192.72\u2009\u00b1\u20099.44\u2009bpm on the BETA dataset, demonstrating superior robustness and efficiency. Significance. By combining complementary algorithmic strengths, MSDFA improves adaptability to individual variability and complex environments, advancing the practical utility and reliability of SSVEP-BCI systems.",
