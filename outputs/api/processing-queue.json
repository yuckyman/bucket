      "title": "Differences in dynamic functional connectivity between naturalistic music listening and rest in preadolescents",
      "content": "IntroductionEngagement with music is a significant aspect of adolescents' lives and this interest blossoms during preadolescence. Compared to the extensive body of research focused on adult music brain function, relatively few studies have examined the neural connections involved in music listening among adolescents and preadolescents. This study aims to investigate the dynamic patterns of brain functional connectivity and the transition processes during naturalistic music listening in preadolescents, measuring the transition of brain states from one time point to the next.MethodsWe employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity of 24 healthy preadolescents aged 8 to 12 years during both music listening and rest conditions. Subsequently, we applied a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), to extract distinct brain states (phase locking patterns) and the corresponding transition processes.ResultsFindings show that occipital brain regions are actively engaged during music listening, possibly linked to attention regulation, visual imagery, and emotional processing. Additionally, we observed a more frequent transition from the default mode network (DMN) state to an orbitofrontal limbic state during music listening, evidencing cognitive shifts that facilitate emotional and reward processing. In contrast, during rest, we obtained a switch to the sensorimotor auditory network, suggesting intrinsic fluctuations in multiple networks.DiscussionThese findings deepen our understanding of subcortical and frontal brain connectivity in preadolescents during music listening, with implications for integrating music into educational practices to support learning and cognitive development.",

      "title": "Is there a link between motor learning and mirror neuron system: TMS study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

      "title": "Assessing consciousness in patients with locked-in syndrome using their EEG",
      "content": "Research indicates that locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients retain both consciousness and cognitive functions, despite their inability to perform voluntary muscle movements or communicate. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) provide a means for these patients to communicate, which is crucial, as the ability to interact with their environment has been shown to significantly enhance their wellbeing and quality of life. This paper presents an innovative approach to analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data from four LIS patients to assess their consciousness levels, referred to as normalized consciousness levels (NCL) in this study. It consists of extracting different features based on frequency, complexity, and connectivity measures to maximize the probability of correctly determining the patients' actual states given the inexistence of ground truth. The consciousness levels derived from this approach aim to improve our understanding of the patients' condition, which is vital in order to build effective communication systems. Despite considerable inter-patient variability, the findings indicate that the approach is effective in detecting neural markers of consciousness and in differentiating between states across the majority of patients. By accurately assessing consciousness, this research aims to improve diagnosis in addition to determining the optimal time to initiate communication with these non-communicative patients. It is important to note that consciousness is a complex and difficult concept to define. In this study, the term \u201cconsciousness level\u201d does not refer to a medical definition. Instead, it represents a scale of NCL values ranging from 0 to 1 representing the likelihood of the patient being fully conscious (1) or not (0).",

      "title": "Mutant mouse models implicate a role for mGluR1/5, prolyl isomerase (Pin1) and Homer1a interactions in wakefulness",
      "content": "IntroductionHealthy sleep and wake are integral to good health and occur when an organism is able to maintain long bouts of both sleep and wakefulness. Homer proteins have been shown to be important for sleep in both Drosophila and mice. For example, genetic deletion of Homer1a in mice results in failure to sustain long bouts of wakefulness. Homer1a has also been shown to amplify mGluR activity by facilitating binding of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 to mGluR. This study uses mouse models to evaluate whether the Homer1a null sleep phenotype may be dependent on the mGluR-Pin1 interaction and examines sleep/wake behavior.MethodsEEG recordings were used to determine and compare sleep and wake in three different mouse models and their littermate control mice. Mouse models included: mGluR(TS-AA) knock-in mice in which Pin1 binding is prevented and activity-dependent prolyl isomerization of mGluR is inhibited; mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice in which Homer binding is eliminated but Pin1 binding is allowed; and a Homer1a null, mGluR(F-R) double mutant mouse to evaluate whether Pin1 binding can rescue the Homer1a knock-out phenotype. Sleep-wake behavior was analyzed using traditional summary measures and a spike-and-slab mixture distribution to better characterize microarchitecture.ResultsKnock-in mGluR(TS-AA) mice display a reduced ability to sustain long bouts of wakefulness during the active lights off period, recapitulating part of the previously observed wake phenotype of the Homer1a knock-out mouse. Alteration of the Homer binding site to mGluR in mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice has no effect on the sleep phenotype, whereas crossing the mGluR(F-R) knock-in into the Homer null background resulted in increased duration of long wake bouts, suggesting a restored ability to maintain wakefulness, with other sleep/wake characteristics similar to littermate mice.ConclusionThese studies highlight the role of Pin1 binding to mGluR as a potential mechanism in the control of sleep/wake behavior. Future studies should explore whether other binding partners of Homer and mGluR also affect sleep and wake.",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",
