      "title": "Differences in dynamic functional connectivity between naturalistic music listening and rest in preadolescents",
      "content": "IntroductionEngagement with music is a significant aspect of adolescents' lives and this interest blossoms during preadolescence. Compared to the extensive body of research focused on adult music brain function, relatively few studies have examined the neural connections involved in music listening among adolescents and preadolescents. This study aims to investigate the dynamic patterns of brain functional connectivity and the transition processes during naturalistic music listening in preadolescents, measuring the transition of brain states from one time point to the next.MethodsWe employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity of 24 healthy preadolescents aged 8 to 12 years during both music listening and rest conditions. Subsequently, we applied a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), to extract distinct brain states (phase locking patterns) and the corresponding transition processes.ResultsFindings show that occipital brain regions are actively engaged during music listening, possibly linked to attention regulation, visual imagery, and emotional processing. Additionally, we observed a more frequent transition from the default mode network (DMN) state to an orbitofrontal limbic state during music listening, evidencing cognitive shifts that facilitate emotional and reward processing. In contrast, during rest, we obtained a switch to the sensorimotor auditory network, suggesting intrinsic fluctuations in multiple networks.DiscussionThese findings deepen our understanding of subcortical and frontal brain connectivity in preadolescents during music listening, with implications for integrating music into educational practices to support learning and cognitive development.",

      "title": "Is there a link between motor learning and mirror neuron system: TMS study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

      "title": "Adrenergic signals influence proteomic responses in breast cancer cells",
      "content": "IntroductionBreast cancer remains a major health challenge due to its molecular heterogeneity and complex interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Adrenergic signaling, mediated by stress hormones such as noradrenaline, has emerged as a potential regulator of cancer progression, influencing cell proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.MethodsThis study investigates the effects of adrenergic modulation on breast cancer spheroids from basal-like (MDA-MB-231, BT549) and luminal-like (T47D, MCF7) cell lines, using 3D culture systems as a more physiologically relevant model compared to traditional 2D monolayer cultures. The 3D spheroid model better recapitulates the structural complexity of tumors, providing insights into cell\u2013cell and cell-matrix interactions that influence signaling pathways and drug responses.ResultsNoradrenaline treatment significantly reduced spheroid size, invasion capacity, and the expression of EMT-related markers and integrins in MDA-MB-231 cells. These effects were partially reversed by propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Luminal-like spheroids, characterized by low ADRB2 abundance, displayed limited responsiveness to adrenergic modulation. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct subtype-specific responses, with basal-like spheroids showing pronounced alterations in pathways related to proliferation, cytoskeletal dynamics, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metabolism, whereas luminal-like spheroids exhibited minimal changes.DiscussionOur findings reveal heterogeneity in adrenergic receptor signaling across basal-like and luminal-like breast cancer cell lines, and also within the basal-like subgroup. This diversity underscores the complexity of adrenergic signaling in breast cancer and highlights the advantages of 3D culture systems. These results provide valuable insights into the subtype-specific patterns of response to adrenergic signaling that contribute to tumor progression and may inform future studies including evaluation of therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "The vermian-crest angle: a prediction model for foetal cystic posterior fossa anomalies",
      "content": "BackgroundAccurate categorisation of the upward rotation of the foetal cerebellar vermis continues to pose diagnostic challenges in prenatal medicine. Recently, a new parameter of the posterior fossa (PF), known as the vermian-crest angle (VCA), has been evaluated using three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) and prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the performance of the VCA in categorizing PF anomalies using 3D-US and to determine its level of agreement with MRI.Study designWe conducted a cohort study involving confirmed cases of PF anomalies. We measured the VCA using 3D-US and compared our data with previously published reference values obtained through both 3D-US and MRI. For statistical analysis, we employed univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).ResultsWe identified 53 foetuses at a mean gestational age (GA) of 24.5 (SD 5.45) weeks with Blake\u2019s pouch cyst (BPC) (n =\u202f11), Dandy\u2013Walker malformation (DWM) (n =\u202f9), mega cisterna magna (MCM) (n =\u202f22), and vermian hypoplasia (VH) (n =\u202f11). Compared to published reference values, the VCA was significantly increased in DWMs (mean 130.6\u00b0, SD 16.75\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.01) and BPCs (mean 91.00\u00b0, SD 19.73\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.05). A VCA\u202f>\u202f80.1\u00b0 distinguished BPCs and DWMs from other PF anomalies, while a VCA\u202f>\u202f107\u00b0 differentiated BPCs from DWMs. When comparing subgroups with published MRI data, we found good agreement between 3D-US and MRI (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.71) (95% CI: 0.55\u20130.87).ConclusionThe VCA may be helpful in categorising PF anomalies using 3D-US, particularly BPC and DWM. The good agreement with MRI measurements reinforces the synergy of these tools in the diagnostic work-up.",

      "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

      "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",
