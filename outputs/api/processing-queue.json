      "title": "From Skin to Cortex: End-to-End Spiking Neural Network Simulation of Tactile Information Flow",
      "content": "Autonomous systems and neuroprosthetic devices demand real-time tactile processing under strict energy and latency constraints. Designing these systems using neuromorphic principles, where communication is event-based and node activity is sparse, could improve their speed and energy efficiency. Here we present an end-to-end spiking neural network model of the ascending tactile pathway, from mechanoreceptors in the skin in humans (or whisker follicles in rodents) to cortical neurons, that operates in an event-driven neuromorphic fashion. The model comprises distinct anatomical stages: three types of mechanoreceptor afferents, the trigeminal ganglion, the brainstem, the thalamic nucleus, and three cortical layers, connected in a feed-forward hierarchy. We demonstrate the model responses to both rodent whisker deflection and human fingertip skin displacement, using information-theoretic analysis, pairwise correlation, and stimulus decoding at each layer. Our results show that tactile information is efficiently encoded and transformed at each stage: stimulus features are represented with high fidelity and reduced redundancy as signals ascend. Notably, simple linear or Bayesian decoders can reliably classify stimulus features from single-neuron activity in the thalamus and cortex for low-noise inputs, highlighting the emergence of robust neural representations. This open-source model is the first to include the mechanosensory periphery in a full tactile pathway simulation, enabling researchers to study how perturbations at any stage affect tactile encoding. Moreover, the network is well-suited for deployment on low-power, real-time neuromorphic hardware, facilitating the development of multi-layer signal processing and tactile navigation algorithms.",

      "title": "Microbiome-behavior coupling shapes infant adaptation to early maternal unpredictability",
      "content": "We asked whether infant microbiome composition, together with infants' behavioral responses to early maternal unpredictability, can offer novel mechanistic insights into behavioral phenotypic variation in human development. Maternal unpredictability was computed as the entropy rate of transitions among maternal sensory signals during naturalistic mother-infant interaction (n=256 dyads; 2-6 months). Infant visual orienting behavior (VOB) was indexed by infants' simultaneous gaze shifts to and from the mother. Higher maternal unpredictability predicted more frequent VOB shifts, indicating a mature-for-age profile, and longitudinally forecast poorer inhibitory control at 19-28 months. A subgroup of infants with high maternal unpredictability and high VOB had inhibitory control outcomes closer to those of infants who experienced low maternal unpredictability, suggesting VOB strategy might buffer against the effects of high maternal unpredictability. In participants with metagenomic data (n=93), VOB was associated with taxonomic and functional gut microbial profiles along a Bifidobacterium breve to Bifidobacterium longum axis. Neuroactive gene-set enrichment analysis linked VOB to increase in tryptophan synthesis and glutamate synthesis genes. In contrast, maternal unpredictability showed depletions of GABA and tryptophan synthesis in the unique-effects model and, when VOB and the maternal unpredictability by VOB term were included, enrichment of acetate synthesis and quinolinic acid degradation. Notably, the maternal unpredictability by VOB interactions for tryptophan and glutamate were negative, indicating that the VOB-pathway coupling attenuates as unpredictability increases. Together, these findings support a framework in which maternal unpredictability is the environmental challenge, infant VOB expresses the behavioral strategy, and microbial metabolism modulates whether that strategy is biochemically feasible.",

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

We confirm that the protocol is interpretable, sensitive, reproducible, and portable across domains. It is especially suited to cognitive and neurocognitive research. We build a Cognitive Drift Index (CDI), confirm its three dimensions, and use a small calibration run to set reasonable ranges. We then map CDI to governance action bands. Using health short videos as a case, we estimate path effects with a weighted least squares ANOVA and test robustness. The steps lead to the same pattern, which supports the protocol\u2019s design and practical use. We show each component alongside the composite and sort totals into action bands so practitioners and responsible-AI teams can choose proportionate actions. We also consider using the method, as a conceptual tool, with eye-tracking or EEG to enable multimodal validation.",

      "content": "Social isolation and perceived loneliness are increasingly recognized as serious public health concerns, with extensive evidence linking them to adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Defined, respectively, as the objective lack of social interactions and the subjective feeling of insufficient connection, both conditions are present across various age groups and are associated with elevated risks of cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders. Epidemiological studies have also identified a strong association between chronic social isolation and the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), potentially mediated by dysregulated stress responses, immune function, and endocrine signaling. Animal models of social deprivation have proven instrumental in elucidating the biological underpinnings of these effects, revealing disruptions in neurotransmitter systems and in the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, with important downstream metabolic alterations. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking social isolation to MetS and CVD, with a focus on oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy. A deeper understanding of these pathways is essential to guide the development of targeted interventions and to reduce the long-term health burden associated with social disconnection.",

      "content": "BackgroundOptimization of brain health is a focal point in medical science, yet data regarding measuring, improving, and preserving lifelong brain health are lacking. This void demands an objective, change-sensitive measure of brain health and proven strategies to strengthen brain performance. The BrainHealth Project addresses these key issues, drawing upon neuroplasticity evidence of persistent modifiability of brain function across the lifespan. This landmark study aims to (i) evaluate and refine multidimensional change indices of brain health, (ii) evaluate the impact of evidenced-based cognitive strategies and lifestyle interventions on improving/maintaining brain health, and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms associated with brain health gains/losses.MethodsThis quantitative, longitudinal, interventional, open-label, single-arm clinical trial aims to recruit 100,000 generally healthy adults ages 18\u2013100 and evaluate changes for 10 years or longer. Assessments, coaching, and training are conducted online through the secure BrainHealth Platform, allowing utilization tracking. The BrainHealth Index (BHI) \u2013 a multidimensional assessment \u2013 is offered at baseline and every 6 months. Participants have access to coaching every 3 months and continual access to self-paced trainings and resources. The primary outcome is the composite BrainHealth Index score and its empirically derived subdomain scores: Clarity (cognitive health), Connectedness (social health), and Emotional Balance (mental health). The BHI includes validated measures sensitive to change, including gains or losses associated with behavior change and integration of cognitive strategies into daily life. This Index contrasts with traditional assessments focused primarily on detecting cognitive decline or diagnosing pathological conditions, yet it, too, has been found to be sensitive to small incremental losses. The primary online training, SMART (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Tactics), is a strategy-based program validated with 25+ years of research. SMART promotes improvements in neural health, cognition, wellbeing, connectedness, and real-life function, previously reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statistical approaches focus on individual prediction using nonlinear models trained with large samples and on assessing mechanisms influencing gains or losses on brain health metrics.DiscussionThis research extends prior RCT evidence to a longitudinal, epidemiologic approach, leveraging digital health and machine learning tools to deliver a generalizable measure of longitudinal brain health and actionable ways to achieve precision brain health. By integrating advanced statistical methods and large-scale data, the BrainHealth Project aims to provide medicine and society with accurate, multidimensional, sensitive, and actionable ways to optimize brain health practices across the lifespan.",
