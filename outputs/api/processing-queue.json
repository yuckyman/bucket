      "title": "On the Causal Role of the Right Lateral Prefrontal Cortex in Active Forgetting",
      "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

      "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
      "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

      "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
      "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

      "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

      "title": "Bilateral Field Advantage of Spatial Attention in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex",
      "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

      "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

      "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
      "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

      "title": "Nighttime sleep modulates mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila",
      "content": "Organisms must focus their attention on ethologically relevant stimuli to maximise survival and reproduction. This is achieved, in part, through a process termed habituation, in which responses to repeated or constant sensory inputs are sequentially dampened, favouring robust responses to novel stimuli. Prior investigations in the fruit fly, Drosophila, have uncovered genes and neural mechanisms that facilitate habituation. However, these works have primarily focused on habituation to visual, olfactory, and gustatory, stimuli. In contrast, neurogenetic processes promoting habituation to mechanosensory stimuli have been less studied. Here we develop an automated system that yields long-term analogue measurements of mechanosensory habituation in adult fruit flies. Using this platform, we reveal a role for the neuronal calcium sensor Neurocalcin in habituation to mechanical stimuli. Loss of Neurocalcin disrupts nighttime but not daytime sleep, particularly under long-night conditions. Mimicking a method used to treat insomnia, we show that compressing nighttime duration restores consolidated night sleep in Neurocalcin mutants. Surprisingly, this manipulation also renormalises mechanosensory habituation in this background, suggesting a link between sleep and mechanosensory habituation. Indeed, we show that limiting night sleep duration in wild type flies similarly impairs habituation to mechanosensory stimuli. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated link between nighttime sleep and mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila.",

      "title": "Selective engagement of the primate orbitofrontal cortex during value-based but not perceptual decisions",
      "content": "A fundamental question in neuroscience is whether the brain uses specialized sub-systems for different types of decisions or relies on a unified decision-making network. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) provides an ideal test case for this question: it has a well-established role in value-based decisions but it remains unknown whether this reflects functional specialization or participation in a broader, general decision network. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used Neuropixels to monitor large ensembles of OFC neurons as a monkey performed both value-based and perceptual decision tasks. Consistent with prior reports, OFC was robustly engaged during value-based decisions. In contrast, OFC was minimally engaged during perceptual decisions, with no significant encoding of task parameters at either the single neuron or population level. This highlights the functional specialization of the OFC for value-based decisions and suggests that the different cognitive demands underlying different types of decisions recruit distinct neural circuits.",

      "title": "Signal mining of botulinum toxin type A adverse events based on FAERS database and its implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy",
      "content": "ObjectiveBased on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), signal mining of adverse drug events (AEs) caused by Botulinum Toxin Type A (BoNTA) was performed to explore its safety implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy (CP).MethodsThe OpenVigil 2.1 platform was used to extract AE reports on BoNTA from the FAERS database, covering the period from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2024. Safety data were analyzed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), with BoNTA designated as the primary suspect drug.ResultsA total of 124,538 AE reports related to BoNTA were identified, showing an overall upward trend in the annual report counts. Most reports originated from the United States, with patients predominantly aged 36\u201360\u202fyears and predominantly female. Prolonged hospitalization was the most frequently reported serious adverse event. Signal analysis identified 325 disproportionately reported events across 21 system-organ classes (SOCs). The top five preferred terms (PTs) by frequency were eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, muscle weakness, blurred vision, and injection site swelling. The top five PTs based on signal strength were brow ptosis, Mephisto sign, botulism, bizarre personal appearance, and neuromuscular toxicity. Notable lowest-level terms (LLTs) included eye swelling, injection site edema, facial pain, facial discomfort, increased residual urine volume, blurred vision, and eyelid swelling.ConclusionIn clinical practice involving BoNTA for CP treatment, clinicians should pay close attention to these identified signals. Strengthened pre-injection evaluation and post-injection monitoring are recommended to enable early detection and timely intervention, ensuring medication safety for patients.",

      "content": "BackgroundThis study aims to develop a screening model for subjective cognitive decline (SCD) based on machine learning techniques.MethodsA retrospective cohort study collected clinical psychological factor data from the \u201cActive Health\u201d screening app under the National Key R&amp;D Program. The final dataset included 598 samples, with an SCD incidence rate of 26.12%. The data were randomly divided into a training set (n = 418). A validation set (n = 180) at a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, prediction models for SCD were constructed using logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and neural network algorithms. Model performance on the validation set was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. SHAP values were used for model interpretability analysis.ResultsThe SVM model showed good performance in the training set, with an AUC of 0.82, indicating strong predictive ability. Information Overload (IO), Self-Perception (SP), Energy Level (EL), Depressive Emotion (DE), Gender (SEX), Risk Decision (RD), and Short-Term Memory (STM) were important feature variables for SCD occurrence.ConclusionThis study successfully developed an SVM-based model for screening the risk of SCD. The SVM model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and traditional LR models.",

      "title": "Detection of leptomeningeal angiomas in brain MRI of Sturge-Weber syndrome using multi-scale multi-scan Mamba",
      "content": "ObjectivesSturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a congenital neurological disorder occurring in the early childhood. Timely diagnosis of SWS is essential for proper medical intervention that prevents the development of various neurological issues. Leptomeningeal angiomas (LA) are the clinical manifestation of SWS. Detection of LA is currently performed by manual inspection of the magnetic resonance images (MRI) by experienced neurologist, which is time-consuming and lack of inter-rater consistency. The aim of the present study is to investigate automated LA detection in MRI of SWS patients.MethodsA Mamba-based encoder-decoder architecture was employed in the present study. Particularly, a multi-scale multi-scan strategy was proposed to convert 3-D volume into 1-D sequence, enabling capturing long-range dependency with reduced computation complexity. Our dataset consists of 40 SWS patients with T1-enhanced MRI. The proposed model was first pre-trained on a public brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) dataset and then fine-tuned and tested on the SWS dataset using 5-fold cross validation.Results and conclusionOur results show excellent performance of the proposed method, e.g., Dice score of 91.53% and 78.67% for BraTS and SWS, respectively, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods as well as two neurologists. Mamba-based deep learning method can automatically identify LA in MRI images, enabling automated SWS diagnosis in clinical settings.",
