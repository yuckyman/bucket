      "title": "Measurement effects on critical scaling in neural systems",
      "content": "The recently developed phenomenological renormalization group (pRG) analysis has uncovered scale-free properties in large-scale neural population recordings across recording modalities, including extracellular electrophysiology and calcium imaging. The convergence of these properties across the datasets hints at universal neural behavior. Yet, it is unknown how differences in temporal resolution and measurement details affect pRG scaling. Here, we use a network model known to produce scaling under pRG analysis as a testbed to assess how recording and analysis choices shape inferred scaling exponents. We show that scaling properties depend on the choices of temporal binning, measurement nonlinearities, and deconvolution, and that the quality of scaling for cluster covariance eigenvalues is particularly sensitive to measurement effects. Moreover, all scaling exponents shift substantially with these transformations, even when the underlying neural dynamics are identical. Together, these results show how experimental choices can change pRG scaling and provide a framework for separating scaling driven by neural dynamics from that introduced by the recording method.",

      "content": "Serotonin is thought to regulate emotional learning and memory, but there remains much to be explored regarding its causal role in cued fear conditioning and extinction (CFC-E). Recent in vivo recording of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neuronal activity during CFC-E paradigm showed that the time course of serotonin level includes both rapid responses to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli and a slowly accumulating component that spans inter-trial intervals and reverses during extinction. By reviewing the studies that directly link the fear expression during CFC-E to the acute or chronic perturbations of serotonin dynamics at the organism level or within specific brain areas via pharmacological, genetic, and projection-specific manipulations, we argue that theoretical models defining the causal role of serotonin must incorporate continuous-time serotonin dynamics.",

      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a longstanding means of non-invasively recording brain signals and has become highly valuable for the study of neurological and cognitive processes. Recent progress in deep learning has also greatly improved both EEG signal analysis and interpretation, making more accurate, reliable and scalable solutions in various healthcare applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the convergence of EEG and deep learning, with an emphasis on diagnostic of neurological disorders, brain recovery, mental health conditions, and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. We methodically investigate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, transformer models and hybrid architectures for EEG-based tasks. Key challenges that have been hampering emerging solutions are critically covered, namely signal-related variability, the lack of data, and deep learning model limited interpretability. Finally, we highlight emerging trends, open issues and promising research directions, with the aim of laying a solid ground toward the improvement of EEG-based healthcare applications and to drive future research in this fast-growing research area.",

      "content": "IntroductionMaternal and child undernutrition are linked to atypical brain development in children. Provision of pre- and post-natal small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) has been shown to positively impact children\u2019s growth and development. It is unknown, however, whether SQ-LNS affects child brain morphology.MethodsThe present study used data from the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements randomized controlled trial in Ghana. Participants were 231 children (Mage = 10.6 years; 49.4% female) exposed to maternal iron and folic acid supplements prenatally (n = 113, control group) or maternal SQ-LNS prenatally until 6 mo postpartum and child SQ-LNS from age 6 to 18 months (n = 118, SQ-LNS group). Children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain anatomy. Primary outcomes were total gray matter volume, cortical gray matter thickness, and cortical gray matter volume assessed with whole-brain analyses. Secondary outcomes were thickness and volume of a priori specified cortical and subcortical regions assessed with region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Basic and full covariate models were tested and corrected for multiple comparisons.ResultsWhole-brain analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in total gray matter volume or cortical gray matter thickness or volume. Cortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) thickness [mean (95%CI): 2.78 (2.73, 2.84) vs. 2.72 (2.67, 2.77); effect size = 0.21] and reduced left rostral ACC volume [2575.1 (2477.3, 2672.8) vs. 2678.74 (2568.7, 2788.8); effect size = 0.18]. Subcortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater volume of the left pallidus [1794.45 (1759.10, 1829.80) vs. 1726.13 (1685.05, 1767.21); effect size = 0.33] and right nucleus accumbens [751.54 (729.83, 773.24) vs. 705.73 (684.21, 727.24); effect size = 0.39]. Significant group differences did not hold after correction for multiple comparisons.DiscussionIn this cohort, pre- and post-natal SQ-LNS supplementation did not significantly alter total or cortical gray matter thickness and volume at 10 years, though secondary ROI analyses indicated subtle, non-robust differences in selected regions.",

      "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",
