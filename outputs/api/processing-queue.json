      "title": "DispatchMAS: Fusing taxonomy and artificial intelligence agents for emergency medical services",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21228v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded, LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods: We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians assessed 100 simulated cases for \"Guidance Efficacy\" and \"Dispatch Effectiveness,\" supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment, readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 % contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 % impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced AI agents into emergency response workflows.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.21293v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.\n  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness, identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding of trustworthy AI systems.\n  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined, operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.\n  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.\n  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological development that benefits all stakeholders.",
