      "content": "arXiv:2601.11532v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This project explores how we engage with AI-generated content through the lens of the jutter: Dutch coastal foragers who comb the shoreline after storms, gathering and repurposing what the sea leaves behind. Reflecting how our lives are increasingly shaped by AI-generated media, we create a beach-like installation that blends real shoreline debris with AI-transformed images and videos. Visitors are invited to explore this space as contemporary jutters, deciding what to keep and what to discard. In doing so, the project reimagines AI-imagery as material for reflection, encouraging a more discerning engagement with the content that drifts through our feeds. A video preview of the installation can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6319Ii7MT8.",

      "title": "NOVAID: Natural-language Observability Visualization Assistant for ITOps Dashboard Widget Generation",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.11531v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Manual creation of IT monitoring dashboard widgets is slow, error-prone, and a barrier for both novice and expert users. We present NOVAID, an interactive chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate IT monitoring widgets directly from natural language queries. Unlike general natural language-to-visualization tools, NOVAID addresses IT operations-specific challenges: specialized widget types like SLO charts, dynamic API-driven data retrieval, and complex contextual filters. The system combines a domain-aware semantic parser, fuzzy entity matching, and schema completion to produce standardized widget JSON specifications. An interactive clarification loop ensures accuracy in underspecified queries. On a curated dataset of 271 realistic queries, NOVAID achieves promising accuracy (up to 94.10% in metric extraction) across multiple LLMs. A user study with IT engineers yielded a System Usability Scale score of 74.2 for NOVAID, indicating good usability. By bridging natural language intent with operational dashboards, NOVAID demonstrates clear potential and a path for deployment in enterprise ITOps monitoring platforms.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11530v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Young adults today face unprecedented mental health challenges, yet many hesitate to seek support due to barriers such as accessibility, stigma, and time constraints. Bite-sized well-being interventions offer a promising solution to preventing mental distress before it escalates to clinical levels, but have not yet been delivered through personalized, interactive, and scalable technology. We conducted the first multi-institutional, longitudinal, preregistered randomized controlled trial of a generative AI-powered mobile app (\"Flourish\") designed to address this gap. Over six weeks in Fall 2024, 486 undergraduate students from three U.S. institutions were randomized to receive app access or waitlist control. Participants in the treatment condition reported significantly greater positive affect, resilience, and social well-being (i.e., increased belonging, closeness to community, and reduced loneliness) and were buffered against declines in mindfulness and flourishing. These findings suggest that, with purposeful and ethical design, generative AI can deliver proactive, population-level well-being interventions that produce measurable benefits.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11529v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold great potential for web-based interactive applications, including browser games, online education, and digital storytelling platforms. However, LLM-based conversational agents suffer from spatiotemporal distortions when responding to variant user inputs, failing to maintain consistency with provided scenarios. We propose SNAP (Story and Narrative-based Agent with Planning), a framework that structures narratives into Cells with explicit Plans to prevent narrative drift in web environments. By confining context within each Cell and employing detailed plans that specify spatiotemporal settings, character actions, and plot developments, SNAP enables coherent and scenario-consistent dialogues while adapting to diverse user responses. Via automated and human evaluations, we validate SNAP's superiority in narrative controllability, demonstrating effective scenario consistency despite variant user inputs in web-based interactive storytelling.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11527v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to provide support and advice in personal domains such as romantic relationships, yet little is known about user perceptions of this type of advice. This study investigated how people evaluate advice on LLM-generated romantic relationships. Participants rated advice satisfaction, model reliability, and helpfulness, and completed pre- and post-measures of their general attitudes toward LLMs. Overall, the results showed participants' high satisfaction with LLM-generated advice. Greater satisfaction was, in turn, strongly and positively associated with their perceptions of the models' reliability and helpfulness. Importantly, participants' attitudes toward LLMs improved significantly after exposure to the advice, suggesting that supportive and contextually relevant advice can enhance users' trust and openness toward these AI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11526v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: LLMs are increasingly being deployed as chatbots, but today's interfaces offer little to no friction: users interact through seamless conversations that conceal when the model is drifting, hallucinating or failing. This lack of transparency fosters blind trust, even as models produce unstable or repetitive outputs. We introduce an interactive demo that surfaces and mitigates cognitive fatigue, a failure mode where LLMs gradually lose coherence during auto-regressive generation. Our system, Chatsparent, instruments real-time, token-level signals of fatigue, including attention-to-prompt decay, embedding drift, and entropy collapse, and visualizes them as a unified fatigue index. When fatigue thresholds are crossed, the interface allows users to activate lightweight interventions such as attention resets, entropy-regularized decoding, and self-reflection checkpoints. The demo streams live text and fatigue signals, allowing users to observe when fatigue arises, how it affects output quality, and how interventions restore stability. By turning passive chatbot interaction into an interactive diagnostic experience, our system empowers users to better understand LLM behavior while improving reliability at inference time.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11525v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have expanded their multimodal code generation capabilities, yet their ability to generate executable visualization code from plots, especially for complex 3D, animated, plot-to-plot transformations, or multi-library scenarios, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce PlotGen-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating plot-to-code generation under realistic and complex visualization scenarios. The benchmark spans 9 major categories, 30 subcategories, and 3 core tasks-plot replication, plot transformation, and multi-library generation, covering both 2D, 3D and animated plots across 5 widely used visualization libraries. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs, we find that open-source models still lag considerably behind in visual fidelity and semantic consistency, despite achieving comparable code executability. Moreover, all models exhibit substantial degradation on reasoning-intensive tasks such as chart type conversion and animation generation. PlotGen-Bench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing research toward more capable and reliable VLMs for visualization authoring and code synthesis, with all data and code available at https://plotgen.github.io.",

We introduce Clusters in Focus, an interactive visual analytics dashboard designed to address this gap. Clusters in Focus employs a three-panel coordinated view: a Data Panel offers multiple perspectives (tabular, heatmap, condensed with histograms / SHAP values) for initial data exploration; a Selection Panel displays the 2D clustering (K-Means/DBSCAN) for a user-selected feature pair; and a novel Cluster Similarity Panel featuring two switchable views for comparing clusters. A ranked list enables the identification of top-matching feature pairs, while an interactive similarity matrix with reordering capabilities allows for the discovery of global structural patterns and groups of related features. This dual-view design supports both focused querying and broad visual exploration. A use case on a Parkinson's disease speech dataset demonstrates the tool's effectiveness in revealing relationships between different feature pairs characterizing the same patient subgroup.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11523v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The popularity of electronic games has grown steadily in recent years, attracting a broad audience across age groups. With this growth comes a large volume of related data, prompting efforts like the PlayMyData to compile and share structured datasets for academic use. This study utilizes such a dataset to compare user review ratings across four current-generation gaming systems: Nintendo, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Statistical methods, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), were applied to identify differences in average scores among these platforms. The findings indicate that PC titles tend to receive the most favorable user feedback, followed by Xbox and PlayStation, while Nintendo games showed the lowest average ratings. These patterns suggest that the platform on which a game is released may influence how players evaluate their experience. Such results may be valuable to developers and industry stakeholders in making informed decisions about future investments and development priorities.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.13297v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how the brain represents the multifaceted properties of words in context is essential for explaining the neural architecture of human language. Here, we combine large-scale psycholinguistic modeling with naturalistic fMRI to uncover the latent structure of word properties and their neural representations during narrative comprehension. By analyzing 106 psycholinguistic variables across 13,850 English words, we identified eight interpretable latent dimensions spanning lexical usage, word form, phonology orthography mapping, sublexical regularity, and semantic organization. These factors robustly predicted behavioral performance across lexical decision, naming, recognition, and semantic judgment tasks, demonstrating their cognitive relevance. Parcel-based and multivariate fMRI analyses of narrative listening revealed that these latent dimensions are encoded in overlapping yet functionally differentiated cortical systems. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analyses further identified four interacting subsystems supporting sensorimotor grounding, controlled semantic retrieval, resolution of lexical competition, and contextual episodic integration. Together, these findings provide a unified neurocognitive framework linking fundamental lexical psycholinguistic dimensions to distributed cortical systems engaged during naturalistic language comprehension.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11533v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Clinical psychology students frequently report feeling underprepared for the interpersonal demands of therapeutic work, highlighting the need for accessible opportunities to practise core counselling skills before seeing real clients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) now enable simulated interaction partners that may support early skills development. This study examined postgraduate clinical psychology students' perceptions of two AI-based simulations: a text-based chatbot (ChatGPT) and a voice-based avatar (HeyGen). Twenty-four students completed two brief cognitive-behavioural role-plays (counterbalanced), one with each tool, and provided both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on perceived usefulness, skill application, responsiveness and engagement, and perceived skill improvement. Both AI tools were evaluated positively across dimensions. However, the avatar was rated significantly higher than the chatbot for perceived usefulness, skill application, and perceived skill improvement, and qualitative comments highlighted the added value of voice-based interaction for conveying social and emotional cues. These findings suggest that AI-driven simulation may supplement early-stage clinical skills training, with voice-based avatars offering additional benefits. Future work should test whether such simulated interactions translate to objective improvements in real therapeutic performance.",

      "title": "Spinal Mechanisms in Post-Activation Potentiation: Facilitation of Presynaptic Inhibition Contrasts H-Reflex Amplitude Reduction",
      "content": "This study investigated the spinal neural mechanisms underlying post-activation potentiation in ten healthy young males (21.9 {+/-} 4.8 years). Participants performed a 10-second maximal isometric plantarflexion, after which we measured twitch torque and assessed spinal excitability using the soleus H-reflex, D1 presynaptic inhibition and heteronymous Ia facilitation (HF). High-density surface EMG was decomposed to track single motor unit responses. The conditioning contraction increased twitch torque by 12.2 Nm (p < 0.001) immediately and returning to baseline within nine minutes. This mechanical potentiation was accompanied by a 29% reduction in H-reflex amplitude (p < 0.001), which recovered within three minutes. Paradoxically, neurophysiological indices of presynaptic inhibition, D1 and HF were significantly increased (D1: p<0.017; HF: p<0.001), resulting in spinal facilitation. Single MU analysis revealed increased discharge probability, particularly in higher-threshold units indicating overall spinal facilitation. These results demonstrate that post-activation potentiation involves a complex dissociation: H-reflex pathway inhibition along facilitation of presynaptic spinal mechanisms. This paradox can be explained by either post-activation depression (caused by depletion of neurotransmitter at the Ia motoneuron synapse) or muscle thixotropy, a contraction history-dependent decrease in muscle spindle sensitivity, which reduces the efficacy of the Ia afferent volley independently of spinal inhibitory mechanisms. Our findings highlight a dissociation between spinal presynaptic facilitation and the depressed H-reflex, underscoring the need for future studies to explicitly test the roles of post-activation depression and muscle thixotropy during post-activation potentiation.",

      "content": "Diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN) is characterized by neuropathic pain accompanied by loss of sensory function. We hypothesized that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) could underlie DPN progression. To address this question, we performed multi-omic evaluation on DRGs from otherwise healthy organ donors, donors with diabetes but no neuropathy, and donors with clinically diagnosed DPN. We discovered that the first stages of neurodegeneration begin early in diabetes before the onset of DPN, with Nageotte nodule formation accompanied by apoptotic gene expression and decreased proportion of specific populations of A-fibers in DPN with remodeling of non-neuronal cells. Our findings define DPN as a neurodegenerative disorder of the DRG, identify molecular markers of disease stage, and highlight the need for early intervention to prevent irreversible neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Evaluating the reliability of functional near-infrared spectroscopy data in the context of a reasoning paradigm",
      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a portable, motion-tolerant neuroimaging method particularly well suited for developmental and naturalistic research. To evaluate the utility of fNIRS for studying individual differences and longitudinal changes, we measured activation and functional connectivity during a relational reasoning task in young adults (N = 73). We sought to (1) establish whether fNIRS captures frontoparietal activation patterns consistent with prior fMRI studies using similar paradigms, (2) assess the effect of the amount of data (number of task blocks) on signal strength and precision, (3) assess the paradigm's measurement properties in the form of intra- and interindividual stability of activation and functional connectivity within and across testing sessions, and (4) examine whether grouping channels into anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) conferred benefits to the above. We observed robust task-evoked activation across lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, with effect sizes on par with prior fMRI studies. Generally, we observed diminishing returns in effect size and measurement precision beyond ~7 minutes. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability varied across metrics; while they were very low for a specific task contrast, they were extremely high for functional connectivity, confirming the robustness of channel- and ROI-level connectivity as a stable marker of functional architecture. Exploratory analyses supported prior observations of lower signal quality in participants with darker skin tones and hair, underscoring the need for inclusive methodological strategies. Together, these findings highlight key design considerations for optimizing longitudinal and individual-differences research on higher-level cognition, particularly in diverse and developmentally variable populations.",

      "title": "Dual Role of Ninjurin-1 in Myeloid Cell Adhesion and Inflammation in Relapse-Remitting EAE",
      "content": "Nerve Injury-Induced Protein 1 (Ninjurin-1) is an adhesion molecule implicated in inflammation and tissue injury, yet its role in neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) remains poorly defined. Here, we identify Ninjurin-1 as a key mediator of immune activation and CNS infiltration in relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE), a model of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Using flow cytometry, gene-expression profiling, and in vivo peptide blockade, we show that Ninjurin-1 is markedly upregulated on CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells during disease progression. Ninjurin-1 myeloid cells display a dual function, as both an adhesion molecule and a marker of inflammatory activation, characterized by increased antigen presentation, cytokine production, and transcriptional enrichment for genes regulating adhesion, migration, and innate immune signaling. Importantly, therapeutic blockade of Ninjurin-1 significantly reduced clinical severity, CNS immune infiltration, and demyelination in RR-EAE. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for Ninjurin-1 in myeloid-driven neuroinflammation and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target for relapsing-remitting MS.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",
