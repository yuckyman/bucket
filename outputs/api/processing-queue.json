      "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
      "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

      "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

      "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

      "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
      "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Building AI Literacy at Home: How Families Navigate Children's Self-Directed Learning with AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.24070v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in children's learning spaces, families face new challenges in guiding its use. Middle childhood (ages 7-13) is a critical stage where children seek autonomy even as parental influence remains strong. Using self-directed learning (SDL) as a lens, we examine how parents perceive and support children's developing AI literacy through focus groups with 13 parent-child pairs. Parents described evolving phases of engagement driven by screen time, self-motivation, and growing knowledge. While many framed AI primarily as a study tool, few considered its non-educational roles or risks, such as privacy and infrastructural embedding. Parents also noted gaps in their own AI understanding, often turning to joint exploration and engagement as a form of co-learning. Our findings reveal how families co-construct children's AI literacy, exposing tensions between practical expectations and critical literacies, and provide design implications that foster SDL while balancing autonomy and oversight.",
