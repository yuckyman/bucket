      "content": "arXiv:2510.01192v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper asserts that emulating empathy in human-robot interaction is a key component to achieve satisfying social, trustworthy, and ethical robot interaction with older people. Following comments from older adult study participants, the paper identifies a gap. Despite the acceptance of robot care scenarios, participants expressed the poor quality of the social aspect. Current human-robot designs, to a certain extent, neglect to include empathy as a theorized design pathway. Using rhetorical theory, this paper defines the socio-cultural expectations for convincing empathetic relationships. It analyzes and then summarizes how society understands, values, and negotiates empathic interaction between human companions in discursive exchanges, wherein empathy acts as a societal value system. Using two public research collections on robots, with one geared specifically to gerontechnology for older people, it substantiates the lack of attention to empathy in public materials produced by robot companies. This paper contends that using an empathetic care vocabulary as a design pathway is a productive underlying foundation for designing humanoid social robots that aim to support older people's goals of aging-in-place. It argues that the integration of affective AI into the sociotechnical assemblages of human-socially assistive robot interaction ought to be scrutinized to ensure it is based on genuine cultural values involving empathetic qualities.",

      "title": "An Optical Measurement System for Open-Source Tracking of Jaw Motions",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01191v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Precise tracking of the jaw kinematics is crucial for diagnosing various musculoskeletal and neuromuscular diseases affecting the masticatory system and for advancing rehabilitative devices such as jaw exoskeletons, a hardly explored research field, to treat these disorders. We introduce an open-source, low-cost, precise, non-invasive, and biocompatible jaw tracking system based on optical motion capture technology to address the need for accessible and adaptable research tools. The system encompasses a complete pipeline from data acquisition, processing, and kinematic analysis to filtering, visualization, and data storage. We evaluated its performance and feasibility in experiments with four participants executing various jaw movements. The system demonstrated reliable kinematic tracking with an estimated precision of $(182 \\pm 47) {\\mu}m$ and $(0.126 \\pm 0.034) {\\deg}$. Therefore, the open-source nature of the system and its utility comparable to commercial systems make it suitable for many research and development contexts, especially for applications such as the integration and design of jaw exoskeletons and customized diagnostic protocols. The complete system is available at GitHub with the aim of promoting innovation in temporomandibular disorders research and jaw assistive technology.",

      "title": "An Anthropologist LLM to Elicit Users' Moral Preferences through Role-Play",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01189v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study investigates a novel approach to eliciting users' moral decision-making by combining immersive roleplaying games with LLM analysis capabilities. Building on the distinction introduced by Floridi between hard ethics inspiring and shaping laws-and soft ethics-moral preferences guiding individual behavior within the free space of decisions compliant to laws-we focus on capturing the latter through contextrich, narrative-driven interactions. Grounded in anthropological methods, the role-playing game exposes participants to ethically charged scenarios in the domain of digital privacy. Data collected during the sessions were interpreted by a customized LLM (\"GPT Anthropologist\"). Evaluation through a cross-validation process shows that both the richness of the data and the interpretive framing significantly enhance the model's ability to predict user behavior. Results show that LLMs can be effectively employed to automate and enhance the understanding of user moral preferences and decision-making process in the early stages of software development.",

      "title": "Beyond Divergence: Characterizing Co-exploration Patterns in Collaborative Design Processes",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01188v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Exploration is crucial in the design process and is known for its essential role in fostering creativity and enhancing design outcomes. Within design teams, exploration evolves into co-exploration, a collaborative and dynamic practice that this study aims to unpack. To investigate this experience, we conducted a longitudinal observational study with 61 students across 16 design teams. Over five months of weekly diary-interviews, we uncovered the intricate dynamics of co-exploration. Our main contribution is a four-dimensional framework that identifies five distinct patterns of co-exploration activities. Our findings reveal how co-exploration emerges across various activities throughout the design process, demonstrating its role in different team interactions. It fosters a sense of togetherness, keeping design teams open-minded and engaged. This engagement cultivates collective intelligence, enabling teams to actively share knowledge, build upon each other's ideas, and achieve outcomes beyond individual contributions. Our study underscores the value of co-exploration, suggesting that it reflects the trajectory of design success and warrants further research. We also provide actionable insights, equipping future practitioners with strategies to enhance co-exploration in design collaborations.",

      "title": "Manim for STEM Education: Visualizing Complex Problems Through Animation",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01187v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many STEM concepts pose significant learning challenges to students due to their inherent complexity and abstract nature. Visualizing complex problems through animations can significantly enhance learning outcomes. However, the creation of animations can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Hence, many educators illustrate complex concepts by hand on a board or a digital device. Although static graphics are helpful for understanding, they are less effective than animations. The free and open-source Python package Manim enables educators to create visually compelling animations easily. Python's straightforward syntax, combined with Manim's comprehensive set of built-in classes and methods, greatly simplifies implementation. This article presents a series of examples that demonstrate how Manim can be used to create animated video lessons for a variety of topics in computer science and mathematics. In addition, it analyzes viewer feedback collected across multiple social media platforms to evaluate the effectiveness and accessibility of these visualizations. The article further explores broader potentials of the Manim Python library by showcasing demonstrations that extend its applications to subject areas beyond computer science and mathematics.",
