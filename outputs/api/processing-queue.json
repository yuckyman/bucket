      "title": "The Role of TCF7L2 in Regulating Energy Metabolism in Thalamocortical Circuitry and its Broader Impact on Social Behavior",
      "content": "Psychiatric and metabolic disorders often co-occur. While shared genetic factors and cellular dysfunctions are implicated, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. TCF7L2, a risk gene for type 2 diabetes and autism spectrum disorder, is highly expressed in the thalamus a brain region extensively interconnected with the cortex, playing a key role in sensory processing, motor control, and behavioral regulation. Given its known role as a transcription factor regulating systemic energy metabolism, we explored its potential contribution to brain metabolism and behavior. To this end, we used a conditional knockout model with postnatal TCF7L2 loss in the thalamus and partial deficiency in the pancreas. Tcf7l2 knockout mice exhibited social deficits and reduced motor habituation. In parallel, they also developed systemic glucose intolerance, modelling the psychiatric-metabolic comorbidity. Thalamic depletion of TCF7L2 resulted in elevated inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase an enzymatic gatekeeper for pyruvate utilization in energy production in the thalamus and cortex. This was accompanied by altered thalamic and cortical metabolism, characterized by reduced efficiency of pyruvate oxidation alongside enhanced oxidation of fatty acids and ketone bodies. Notably, a ketogenic diet alleviated metabolic dysregulation in the brain and normalized the approach to social novelty in knockout mice. These findings suggest that impaired energy metabolism in the thalamocortical circuitry may represent one of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I would like to thank everyone who gave great advice on doing this upgrade. In the event, it took me about seven hours, with no recourse to AI coding required. The Python 3 version hasn't been pushed into production yet, but I'd estimate it's probably 90% of the way there.</p> <p>I decided to go for the big push, and I think that worked out. I did take the advice to not go all the way to 3.14. Once I am convinced everything is fully operational, I'll go to 3.13, but I'll hold off on 3.14 for a bit more package support.</p> <p>Switching package management to `uv` helped, as did the small-but-surprisingly-good test suite.</p> <p>In rough order, the main problems I encountered were:</p> <ul> <li>bytes and strings. Literals themselves were OK (the code was already all unicode_literals), but things like hash functions that take bytes were a bit tedious.</li> <li>Django API changes. I have to say, love Django to death, but the project's tendency to make &quot;this looks better&quot; breaking changes is not my favorite part of it.</li> <li>Django bugs. Well, bug: the `atomic` decorator can swallow exceptions. I spent some time tracking down a bytes/string issue because the exception was just `bad thing happened` by the time it reached the surface.</li> <li>Packages. This was not as horrible as I thought it would be. There were a few packages that were obsolete and had to be replaced, and a few whose APIs were entirely different. Using `pipdeps` and `uv` to separate out requested packages vs dependencies was extremely helpful here.</li> </ul> <p>Most of the changes could be done with global search and replaces.</p> <p>Things that weren't a problem:</p> <ul> <li>Python language features. There were no real issues about the language itself that `futurize` didn't take care of (in fact, I had to pull out a few of the `list` casts that it dropped in).</li> <li>Standard library changes. Almost none. Very happy!</li> </ul> <p>Weird stuff:</p> <ul> <li>The code has a lot of raw SQL queries, often with regexes. The stricter checking in Python 3 made a lot of noise about &quot;bad escape sequences.&quot; Turning the query text to a raw string fixed that, so I guess that's the new idiom.</li> <li>There were some subtle changes to the way Django renders certain values in templates, and apparently some types' string conversions are now more like `repr`.</li> </ul> <p>One more thing that helped:</p> <ul> <li>A lot of the problematic code (from a conversion point of view) was moribund, and was hanging around from when this system replaced its predecessor (which was written in PHP), and had a lot of really crufty stuff to convert the old data structures to Python ones. That could all just be dropped in the trash.</li> </ul> <p>Thanks again for all the amazing advice! I am sure it would have taken 10x longer if I hadn't had the guidance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MisterHarvest\"> /u/MisterHarvest </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxhjj7/the_great_leap_forward_python_27_312_django_111_52/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxhjj7/the_great_leap_forward_python_27_312_django_111_52/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), efficient remyelination is critical for functional recovery. Remyelination efficiency declines with age, and is linked to progressive disability. The gene regulatory network underlying remyelination, and how it is altered with aging, remains unclear. Here we present a comparative single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analysis of remyelination in young and aged mice. We identified gene modules dynamically expressed throughout oligodendrocyte differentiation, revealing age-dependent changes in key processes related to myelination. Multi-omic analysis allowed us to map the regulatory network driving efficient remyelination within oligodendrocyte lineage cells in young mice. We highlight key transcription factors in the network dysregulated with age, and we describe similar dysregulations in MS lesions. Modifying the expression of these transcription factors in primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells impacts differentiation. These findings provide a foundational understanding of this regenerative process in the context of aging and in chronic demyelinating diseases.",

      "content": "The timing of spikes dictates a neuron's impact on downstream circuits and behavior, and spike timing is determined by the membrane potential (Vm). However, due to technical challenges, it has been impossible to analyze the relative timing of Vm dynamics between neurons during behavior. Using large scale membrane voltage imaging, we simultaneously recorded Vm from many individual hippocampal neurons in animals engaged in a virtual spatial task. We found that relative phase of Vm theta oscillations across neurons exhibit gradual or discrete shifts depending on spatial position. This finding extends beyond previous studies showing Vm dynamics in single neurons or spiking activity in multiple neurons, revealing previously unknown evidence for consistent coding of space by spike-independent relative phase of Vm theta dynamics between neurons.",

      "content": "The capacity to adapt behavior across different contexts is a fundamental feature of intelligence and is crucial for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which neural circuits are contextually reconfigured to alter their function are poorly understood. As a universal, ecological behavior, foraging provides a natural window into the neural basis of decision making and cognitive flexibility. We developed complementary free-moving and virtual tasks in which mice make foraging decisions and switch between context-specific decision strategies by toggling distinct configurations of integrator dynamics for evidence accumulation. Neural recordings reveal brain-wide activity states recruited by foraging environments which organize divergent dynamics subspaces and orthogonal coding of context-specific decision variables in separate neural subpopulations. In the dorsal frontal cortex, this coding structure is preserved across experimental settings, supports rapid dynamics reconfiguration for volitional mode switching, and is functionally necessary for decision flexibility.",

      "title": "The extracellular ATP/P2X7R signaling axis drives early neuroinflammation and neuronal hyperexcitability in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model",
      "content": "Neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction are emerging as early and potentially causative events in Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet their molecular triggers remain elusive. Here, we identify extracellular ATP (eATP), a major damage-associated molecular pattern, and its purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) as pivotal drivers of early pathology in AD mice. In vivo bioluminescence imaging revealed a significant cortical accumulation of eATP in AD mice as early as 2 months of age--before amyloid plaque deposition and cognitive impairment. This increase is associated with inflammasome activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, microglia reactivity, aberrant synaptic pruning and perineuronal net degradation. Strikingly, genetic deletion of P2X7R rescues these alterations. Two-photon calcium imaging further demonstrates that P2X7R knockout counteracts AD-related neuronal hyperactivity. These findings set the eATP-P2X7R signaling axis as an early driver of AD pathology, linking neuroinflammation to synaptic remodeling and circuit dysfunction, and suggest P2X7R inhibition as a compelling strategy to counteract AD progression.",

      "title": "Functional Genomic Profiling of Schizophrenia-Associated Genes Reveals Key Microglial Regulators",
      "content": "Microglia are increasingly recognized as key regulators of neural circuit development and putative contributors to the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the functional impact of SCZ-associated genes in microglia remains largely unexplored. Here, we performed an arrayed CRISPR targeting screen of 30 schizophrenia-associated genes predicted to be differentially expressed in human microglia-like cells. Target genes were prioritized based on post-mortem transcriptomic relevance and predicted ontology-based roles in phagocytosis pathways. We quantified phagocytic activity and morphological changes following gene targeting using high-content confocal imaging. Key targets, including CYFIP1, MSR1, TREM2, SYK, ITGB2, ITGAM and IRF8, modulated phagocytosis and altered morphological properties consistent with activation states, validating their functional roles in microglia. To elucidate transcriptional impact, we further applied a multiplexed RNA sequencing platform across gene targets. These analyses revealed gene-specific transcriptional signatures, implicating divergent pathways related to phagocytic, activation, cytoskeletal, and lysosomal function. Together, these findings demonstrate the utility of CRISPR-based functional genomics in characterizing microglia function and identifying new target genes and mechanisms that may underlie their contributions to schizophrenia pathophysiology.",
