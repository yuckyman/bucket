      "title": "Distinct prior expectations shape tactile and proprioceptive localization",
      "content": "When a mosquito lands on your finger, swatting it away requires your brain to calculate its location in the external space, which depends on the body's 3D posture. Two competing hypotheses explain how the brain solves this challenge: the integration hypothesis, where tactile signals are transformed into spatial coordinates by integrating touch and posture information; and the cueing hypothesis, where touch merely cues a location on the body whose position is specified via proprioception. Adjudicating between these hypotheses is nearly impossible without modeling the latent factors underlying somatosensory spatial perception. We fill this gap in the present study. We first formalized each hypothesis from a Bayesian perspective: If touch merely triggers proprioceptive localization (cueing hypothesis), tactile and proprioceptive localization should rely on the same Bayesian computations, with identical prior expectations about the mosquito's spatial location; If they involve distinct Bayesian computational processes (integration hypothesis), distinct prior expectations may shape tactile and proprioceptive localization. To test these predictions, we had nineteen participants localize either proprioceptive or tactile targets on their fingertips. We then fit their data with several Bayesian models of each hypothesis. Models allowing different prior distributions between modalities provided the best fit for most participants, with 17 out of 19 participants showing significantly different prior distributions across modalities. These provide strong computational evidence that tactile and proprioceptive localization rely on distinct computational mechanisms, a conclusion that has important implications for how we understand these everyday behaviors and their neural mechanisms.",

      "title": "Critical neuronal avalanches emerge from excitation-inhibition balanced spontaneous activity",
      "content": "Neuronal avalanches are sequences of neural activations that exhibit scale-invariant statistics, suggesting neural activity operates near a critical point. Theoretical studies proposed that the balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I), along with neuromodulation, are key factors influencing this critical behavior. Here, we performed in-vivo studies to investigate the role of E and I neurons in generating neuronal avalanches in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae. For this, we used double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing cell-type-specific fluorescent proteins and GCaMP6f, combined with immunostaining and selective-plane illumination microscopy to monitor spontaneous neuronal activity and neurotransmitter identity. We found that neural activity approached criticality at balanced E-I ratios but became disordered when E-I ratios were imbalanced. A stochastic network model operating at a critical point, where excitation and inhibition couplings are balanced and balanced amplification drives network avalanches, successfully reproduced the observed statistics of neuronal avalanches and their dependence on E-I ratio fluctuations.",

      "title": "Mislocalisation of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes causes axonopathy and dysmyelination",
      "content": "Neurons with large, myelinated axons are vulnerable to degeneration across the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) disease spectrum. The defining molecular pathology of this spectrum is mislocalisation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Even though cytoplasmic TDP-43 is prevalent in neurons and oligodendrocytes, how these molecular pathologies contribute to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we developed humanised zebrafish in which we restricted TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 restricted to neurons led to a severe axonopathy, with extreme distal axonal swelling and reduced myelination. Axonopathy was mirrored by cell type specific loss of TDP-43 function from neurons, pointing to loss of function, rather than a toxic gain of function of mislocalised TDP-43, as driving this phenotype. Preventing oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination when TDP-43 was mislocalised in neurons exacerbated axonopathy, indicating that oligodendrocytes limit neurodegeneration. Indeed, when TDP-43 was mislocalised to the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes this also led to axonopathy and reduced myelination, pointing to complex contributions of neurons and oligodendrocytes to neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Micro-/nano-plastics accentuate Parkinson's Disease-relevant phenotypes in a Drosophila model",
      "content": "Micro- and nano-plastic (MNP) particles are a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that are increasingly bioaccumulating in human tissues, particularly the brain. MNPs induce mitochondrial defects, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and neurotoxicity in cellular and organismal models. This raises the possibility that MNP exposure could cause or exacerbate neurological conditions associated with these pathological phenomena. Parkinson's Disease (PD), a common movement disorder characterised by degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons, and associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, represents such a condition. We therefore hypothesised that MNP exposure might interact with PD risk mutations affecting mitochondrial fidelity. We used a fruit fly model of PRKN-dependent PD associated with defects in mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control pathway, to test this hypothesis. We found that ingestion of MNPs at concentrations tolerated by wild-type controls selectively enhanced PD-relevant phenotypes - including progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, movement defects, and sleep disruption - in this model of PD. Our data suggest that defects in mitochondrial quality control can increase vulnerability to MNP exposure, and more broadly, that MNPs may synergistically interact with existing genetic risk factors to worsen neurological disease.",

      "content": "Error recognition is fundamental to adaptive behavior, enabling rapid compensatory action when outcomes deviate from expectations. Central to this function are neural circuits for performance monitoring, encoding cognitive signals that could support more reliable neural interfaces. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in epilepsy patients to enable a motor brain-computer interface (BCI) while sampling error-related activity across a distributed network. Our work reveals high-frequency population dynamics emerging in the anterior insula and propagating to the prefrontal cortex as the interface fails to follow the user's intention. We identify spatially organized insular responses to error processing and movement feedback, highlighting it as a heterogeneous hub linking action and outcome. Real-time integration of error responses enables a self-correcting neural interface that enhances usability by reducing the need for manual user intervention. Together, our work demonstrates a human intracranial BCI harnessing insular brain activity, integrating cognitive processes directly into device control.",

      "title": "An inhibitory feedback circuit mediating sleep need and sensory gating in Drosophila",
      "content": "Many animals integrate sensory information during the day and sleep at night. How sensory processing during wakefulness contributes to making an organism tired at night, however, remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of excitatory helicon cells in Drosophila (ExR1), a distinct neural population dedicated to processing sensory information. Using combined optogenetics and voltage imaging, we show that helicon cells excite sleep-promoting R3m ring neurons and trigger a subsequent autoinhibition of R3m via voltage- and Ca2+-gated K+ channels such as Slowpoke. Investigating the flies' sleep patterns, we found that blocking synaptic output from helicon as well as RNAi-mediated knockdown of Slowpoke in R3m reduces sleep quality and leads to loss of nocturnal sleep, indicating that sleep need is generated via this route. Further, we show that excitation of R3m induces feedback inhibition of helicon cells via ionotropic GABA receptors. Knockdown of the ionotropic GABA receptor subunit Rdl in helicon cells increases sleep latency and causes sleep loss at the beginning of the night. We show that inhibition via Rdl facilitates nocturnal slow-wave activity which forms a sensory filter and prevents sleep disruption through auditory stimuli. We therefore uncover an inhibitory feedback circuit, in which neurons processing sensory information directly activate sleep promoting neurons to generate sleep need. At night, this sleep need is then converted into actual sleep, facilitated by the formation of a neural filter that stabilizes sleep/wake transition.",

Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
      "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",
