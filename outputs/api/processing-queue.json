      "title": "Modeling Hierarchical Brain Dynamics Outperforms Hormonal Biomarkers in Predicting Menstrual Cycle Phases",
      "content": "Hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle influence large-scale brain dynamics, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, 60 naturally cycling women were scanned using resting-state fMRI during the early follicular, pre-ovulatory, and mid-luteal phases. We then applied a thermodynamics-inspired framework to explore the functional hierarchical organization of whole-brain dynamics across these phases. First, we found that brain dynamics are significantly modulated by estradiol, progesterone, and age across multiple resting-state networks. Second, to elucidate underlying mechanisms, we estimated generative effective connectivity (GEC) matrices using whole-brain models and trained support vector machine classifiers to predict menstrual phases. These model-based biomarkers outperformed traditional functional connectivity and hormone measures in classifying menstrual cycle phases. These findings reveal that menstrual cycle-related changes modulate the hierarchical reorganization of brain dynamics, highlighting the potential of model-based approaches to advance women's brain health research.",

      "content": "Dopamine (DA) depletion is known to result in Parkinsonian symptoms such as the inability to initiate movements (akinesia). While Parkinsonian akinesia is traditionally associated with reduced DA signaling in the striatum, the contribution of cortical regions that also receive DA projections and project to the striatum remains unclear. Here, we identify a previously unexplored cortical circuit involving D1-like dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that is critical for initiating goal-directed movements. We find that a selective activation of ACC-D1+ neurons can flexibly drive targeted movement and locomotion even in akinetic mice after dopamine depletion or receptor antagonism. These findings uncover a cortical mechanism for movement initiation and offer promising new therapeutic targets for treating Parkinsonian akinesia.",

      "title": "Biochemical Regulation of Brain Kynurenic Acid Synthesis and Inhibition in Rats is Sensitive to the Time of Day",
      "content": "Neurochemical imbalances, including elevations of the tryptophan metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous antagonist of glutamatergic and cholinergic receptors, are linked to cognitive and sleep disturbances in psychiatric and neurocognitive disorders. Therapeutic strategies to reduce brain KYNA by inhibiting kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) are under investigation. However, few studies consider time as a biological variable, despite recent evidence that the time of day can affect brain metabolism and drug effectiveness. Therefore, we explore the hypothesis that KYNA formation and synthesis inhibition change throughout the day. Using rats of both sexes, we measured basal KYNA levels and the effects of kynurenine (100 mg/kg, i.p.), to stimulate de novo KYNA, and/or PF-04859989 (KAT II inhibitor, 30 mg/kg, s.c.), at the beginning of light or dark phases. Microdialysis was used to assess extracellular KYNA in the dorsal hippocampus, and ex vivo assays evaluated KAT enzyme activity in separate animals. Additionally, we examined KYNA levels and the effects of PF-04859989 during acute sleep deprivation in male rats. PF-04859989 significantly decreased stimulated KYNA synthesis in both sexes and basal KYNA in males. In the dark phase, compared with the light phase, male rats treated with kynurenine and/or PF-04859989 showed higher KYNA levels and greater KYNA synthesis inhibition, respectively. In vitro, KAT II activity was similarly higher, and PF-04859989 was more effective, in the dark than in the light phase. Sleep deprivation increased extracellular KYNA levels, and PF-04859989 prevented this increase. Overall, our findings highlight the need to consider time-dependent factors when developing therapies impacting KYNA synthesis.",

      "content": "Learning efficacy relies on balancing reward-driven motivation with the difficulty of reaching a goal. Disentangling these factors is essential for understanding learning dynamics. Spatial navigation is a standard paradigm for probing these processes in rodents, but variation in mazes, cues, and protocols makes it difficult to determine how reward properties, rather than task design, shape learning and exploration-exploitation strategies. To date, no studies have directly compared reward type and learning difficulty within a single behavioral context. Here, we used the Starmaze to examine how reward modality and task complexity jointly influence learning and the transition from exploration to exploitation. We created three versions of the same sequential egocentric task in which a fixed goal was rewarded with either a hidden escape platform (aquatic version), food pellets, or medial forebrain bundle stimulation. Task difficulty varied by increasing the number of required decision points from zero to three. Our results reveal distinct behavioral dynamics across reward modalities and provide a unified framework for studying reward-dependent learning in sequential navigation.",

      "title": "The Protein Disulfide Isomerase P4HB/PDIA1 Modulates PrPC Levels and Prion Replication",
      "content": "Prions are misfolded, self-propagating versions of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) that cause invariably fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. Little is known about how prions replicate in the brain, including whether other proteins participate in prion replication in vivo. Several members of the protein disulfide isomerase family have been shown to reside in close spatial proximity to PrPC in cells and mice, implying that they could be involved in prion biogenesis. Here, we show that stable knock-down of the protein disulfide isomerase P4HB (also called PDIA1) in prion-susceptible CAD5 cells reduces PrPC levels and results in lower levels of protease-resistant PrP (PrPres), a marker of infectious prions, following infection with two different prion strains. Partial reduction of P4HB activity using the P4HB-selective inhibitor KSC-34 also decreases PrPC levels in uninfected CAD5 cells whereas treatment of prion-infected CAD5 cells with KSC-34 results in higher levels of PrPres. A proportion of P4HB reaches the cell surface where PrPC is located, and a secreted P4HB variant increases PrPres levels in cells. Collectively, these results suggest that P4HB facilitates prion replication in cells by stabilizing PrPC and potentially acting as a chaperone that directly modulates prion conversion. Thus, targeting P4HB during prion disease may have therapeutic benefit.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Category learning disentangles representation of trial events in hippocampus CA1",
      "content": "The hippocampus (HC) is known to encode task-relevant variables, including latent ones, capturing and parsing critical information from sequences into episodes. This is thought to be the basis to form a cognitive map of possible abstract states beyond mere perceptual details, akin a state machine, with predictive value, contributing to an internal world model. However, its specific role in categorization tasks in general, where learning a category may depend on independent, unordered (non sequential) experienced examples, remains unclear. Here, we investigate CA1 population coding during a categorization paradigm in mice in combination with calcium imaging at different stages of category training with interleaved generalization tests. Our results reveal that hippocampal coding changes critically throughout the different stages of categorization training. Specifically, the disentangling of choice and outcome variables emerges as factorized, abstract, representations and fundamentally distinguishes simple discrimination from categorization training. Furthermore, this factorized geometry relates to improved behavioral performance. Our findings suggest that trial encoding on HC adapts in response to the category structure presented by representing critical events into the appropriate computational format to support generalization of category membership.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",
