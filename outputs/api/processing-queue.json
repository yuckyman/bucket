      "content": "The entorhinal cortex (ERC) is implicated in early progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we investigated the impact of established biological risk factors for AD, including APOE genotype (E2 versus E4 alleles), sex, and ancestry, on gene expression in the human ERC. We generated paired spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data (snRNA-seq) in postmortem human ERC tissue from middle aged brain donors with no history of AD. APOE-dependent changes in gene expression predominantly mapped to a transcriptionally-defined oligodendrocyte subtype, which varied substantially with ancestry, and suggested differences in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Integration of SRT and snRNA-seq data identified a common gene expression signature associated with APOE genotype, which we localized to the same oligodendrocyte subtype and a white matter spatial domain. This suggests that AD risk in ERC may be associated with disrupted oligodendrocyte function, potentially contributing to future neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Synchronization of two active ears via binaural coupling",
      "content": "The two ears of many non-mammalian vertebrates are acoustically coupled through an interaural cavity. Sounds can hit both the external and internal surfaces of the tympanic membranes, providing mechanical directional sensitivity for sound localization. This coupling may also give rise to binaural synchronization. In other words, each inner ear could influence the function of the other. Previous work in lizards demonstrates that binaural coupling affects the spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) measured at each external auditory meatus, with properties indicative of binaural synchronization. However, it is unclear how binaural coupling and, consequently, synchronization contribute to SOAE generation, which is typically modelled as being localized to an individual ear. We simultaneously measured SOAEs at both ears of green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis) and found robust relationships between them, including evidence that binaural synchronization could not be attributed to one ear uniformly driving the other. Instead, we observed frequency-dependent phase-locking between the two ears, primarily at frequencies where SOAE peaks occurred in both ears. While some pairs of ears were more strongly synchronized than others, we consistently found that binaural coupling could have greater effects on the resulting emissions than the coupling between generators within the same ear. We propose a framework for active hearing that incorporates binaural coupling, accounting for its effects on SOAE generation and sound localization in the green anole.",

      "title": "Epigenetic editing of Cartpt promotes acquisition and extinction of cocaine memory",
      "content": "In classic disease models, removing a pathological insult restores homeostasis. Yet, addiction persists far beyond the period of active drug use. Cocaine abstinence induces changes in gene expression and neuronal signaling in reward-related brain regions that limit recovery during abstinence. We found that 2 weeks of abstinence increased Cartpt (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) in the mouse nucleus accumbens and decreased repressive H3K27me3 at the Cartpt locus. While endogenous CART peptide is best described for its anorexigenic function, it is also implicated in human addiction and dopamine homeostasis. To test the causal relevance of Cartpt chromatin remodeling, we used CRISPR-based epigenetic editing tools, dCas9-FOG1 and dCas9-JMJC-ZF, to manipulate H3K27me3 at Cartpt in vivo. Enriching H3K27me3 in D1 neurons repressed Cartpt expression and augmented acquisition and extinction of cocaine preference. These results show that CRISPR epigenetic editing can recapitulate endogenous chromatin states to modulate addiction-related behavior, highlighting broad therapeutic potential of both Cartpt and epigenetic editing.",

      "title": "Developmental deviations of structural connectivity in youths with ADHD predict symptom and treatment outcomes",
      "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) lacks validated biomarkers to track symptom development or guide treatment selection in youth. We quantified individual deviations from normative age-related trajectories of white-matter structural connectivity (SC) across two independent cohorts: 6,687 typically developing and 1,114 ADHD scans from the ABCD study, and 292 typically developing and 482 ADHD participants from a Chinese cohort. Youth with ADHD showed pronounced SC deviations, especially in higher-order association pathways. A subset of connections showed ADHD-specific developmental reductions in deviations beyond typical developmental patterns, and these changes mediated the age-related decline in ADHD symptoms. Longitudinal within-individual analyses demonstrated that decreases in deviation over two years tracked symptom improvement. Baseline deviations also predicted 12-week treatment response to atomoxetine, but not methylphenidate, and follow-up imaging revealed treatment-related reductions in deviation. Together, these findings identify SC deviation as a robust developmental biomarker with prognostic and theragnostic relevance for ADHD, supporting precision care through risk stratification, individualized pharmacotherapy selection, and objective monitoring of treatment effects.",

      "title": "Pathogenic IgG from long COVID patients with neurological sequelae triggers sensitive but not cognitive impairments upon transfer into mice",
      "content": "Approximately 30% of long COVID patients still experience neurological symptoms (brain fog, pain, chronic fatigue) more than 4 months after the onset of COVID-19. This condition, known as neurological long COVID, remains poorly understood and might be explained by a persisting autoimmune response against nervous-derived self-antigens. The aim of this study is to determine whether IgG autoantibodies from long COVID patients with neurological sequelae can bind to central or peripheral nervous system epitopes and triggers neuropsychiatric symptoms upon passive transfer into mice, thereby mirroring patient-reported manifestations. Long COVID patients meeting the 2021 consensus WHO definition were included following a standardized neuropsychological assessment, while excluding patients with a medical history of autoimmune and neurological disorders. Age- and sex-matched asymptomatic individuals were used as healthy controls. Total IgGs were isolated using protein G purification and injected intraperitoneally into C57Bl6/J mice for four consecutive days. During the two weeks post-injections, behavioral tests assessed mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, spatial working memory, depression, and anxiety. Mice injected with IgG from long COVID patients showed no difference with the control group in terms of anxiety or depression behaviors, as well as no impairment of short- or long-term spatial memories and thermal hyperalgesia. However, they displayed a transient decrease of paw withdrawal threshold during the first week. This effect was abolished when IgG-depleted serum or papain-digested IgGs were transferred. IgG from long COVID patients accumulated in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia of injected mice and colocalized with proprioceptive and nociceptive sensory neurons, without inducing local neuroinflammation or astrogliosis. These data demonstrate that IgGs from long COVID patients bind to peripheral sensory neurons and induce pain-related symptoms in mice. Our findings also support the hypothesis that autoantibodies mediate pain-related pathophysiology in the spectrum of long COVID symptoms.",
