      "title": "Drowsiness alters the neural dynamics but not the core computations of multisensory integration",
      "content": "Fluctuations in alertness shape perception and behaviour, yet how they affect the brain's ability to integrate information across senses remains poorly understood. Here we investigated whether multisensory integration is preserved as humans transition from wakefulness to drowsiness. Participants performed an audio-tactile detection task while electroencephalography tracked spontaneous declines in alertness. Behaviourally, multisensory stimulation continued to facilitate responses during drowsiness, despite slowing and increased omissions. However, reaction-time distributions revealed reduced violations of race-model predictions, indicating weakened computational evidence for multisensory integration. Neurally, event-related signatures of multisensory interactions were delayed and attenuated during drowsiness. By contrast, multivariate decoding showed that multisensory neural representations remained detectable, although less temporally stable. Crucially, early cross-state generalization revealed shared representational structure across alertness states, indicating preserved core multisensory computations. These findings show that multisensory integration remains functional but is dynamically altered as alertness declines, revealing how the brain maintains adaptive behaviour during the wake-to-sleep transition.",

      "title": "A Drosophila screen identifies domino as a link between chromatin regulation and synaptic organization",
      "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with diverse genetic risk factors. To identify conserved mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes, we conducted a targeted screen in Drosophila using MiMIC insertion mutants of high-confidence genes from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database. Behavioral assays identified 52 heterozygous lines with significant changes in sleep, activity, or social behavior in one or both sexes. Among these, the chromatin remodeler domino (dom), the ortholog of human SRCAP, emerged as a particularly compelling candidate. Heterozygous dom mutants exhibited altered social spacing and male-biased sleep and activity dysregulation, phenotypes that were replicated in an additional allele. RNA-sequencing of adult brains showed that reduced dom expression affected genes involved in signaling and structural pathways in both sexes, offering potential molecular links to the behavioral outcomes. In addition, dom disruption caused widespread splicing dysregulation, with differentially spliced genes enriched for pathways related to synaptic signaling, further implicating synaptic communication as a convergent mechanism. Consistent with these results, immunofluorescence revealed increased synaptic architecture in the antennal lobe, a brain region associated with sleep and sensory processing. Together, these findings highlight the utility of Drosophila for modeling conserved ASD risk genes and implicate domino in the regulation of synaptic communication and behavior through transcriptional and splicing regulation.",

      "title": "Repeated Mild Head Injury Establishes a Senescent Cranial Bone Marrow Niche that Impairs Brain Metabolism",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) of any severity is associated with long-term systemic inflammation and increased risk of peripheral comorbidities, yet the mechanisms driving immune dysregulation and accelerated aging after repeated mild head impacts remain poorly defined. Here, we investigated the acute and chronic effects of repeated mild TBI (rmTBI) on distal and proximal bone marrow compartments in the femur and calvaria, respectively. Using a modified weight-drop mouse model delivering rotational and acceleration/deceleration forces (3 hits/week for up to 16 weeks), rmTBI produced no mortality, skull fracture, hemorrhage, or brain leukocyte infiltration. One day after three consecutive impacts, rmTBI induced robust proliferation of LSK stem/progenitor cells in both femoral and calvarial marrow, evidenced by Ki67 expression, BrdU incorporation, and increased monocyte output. By 8 weeks (24 impacts), injury-induced proliferation subsided and LSK cells exhibited increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and upregulation of tumor suppressor genes. At 16 weeks (48 impacts), LSK populations were depleted at both sites, displaying reduced proliferative capacity, telomere shortening, and pancytopenia in otherwise young adult mice. Calvarial bone marrow cells exposed to rmTBI released a distinct cytokine and proteomic secretome marked by elevated IL-6, suppressed mitochondrial and metabolic signaling, and enhanced DNA repair pathways. Notably, skull-derived secretome factors impaired cortical and hippocampal mitochondrial metabolism, and reduced microglial mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these findings identify replicative senescence of the brain-adjacent bone marrow niche as an early and progressive consequence of repeated mild head injury, linking rmTBI to long-lasting metabolic dysfunction, impaired immunity, and accelerated aging.",

      "title": "Restoration of Rapid-Eye Movement Sleep During Cocaine Abstinence Reduces Incubation of Cocaine Seeking and Normalizes Dopamine Transporter Function",
      "content": "Progressive increases in cocaine craving or seeking during abstinence from cocaine are thought to contribute to relapse. Recent observations suggest that sleep disruptions during abstinence from cocaine may have a significant influence on cocaine seeking. While the neural mechanisms underlying the association between sleep disruptions and increases in cocaine seeking during abstinence continue to be investigated, alterations in mesolimbic dopamine transmission may be a common factor. In these studies, we assessed whether sleep disruptions during abstinence are associated with incubation of cocaine seeking and dopamine terminal adaptations in the nucleus accumbens core of female and male rats. We observed that intermittent access to cocaine followed by abstinence reduced rapid-eye movement sleep, intensified cue-induced cocaine seeking, and enhanced dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. Notably, a sleep restoration procedure that restricted sleep to the light phase (active period) restored rapid-eye movement sleep, prevented incubation of cocaine seeking, and normalized baseline dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. These findings indicate that rapid-eye movement sleep disruptions during abstinence contribute to exaggerated cocaine seeking and that dopamine transporter adaptations are a potential molecular substrate through which these changes occur. Thus, interventions that restore sleep during cocaine abstinence may serve as effective behavioral therapies for reducing cocaine craving and preventing subsequent relapse.",

      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

      "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

      "title": "Drawing the Line: Wearable Linear Haptics Motivated by Guided Breathing",
      "content": "Haptic wearables provide an intuitive human-machine interface to convey information through the sense of touch, which may have promising applications in guided breathing. In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

      "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
      "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

      "title": "HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface With Hierarchical Force Control",
      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "title": "\u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d: Studying the Influence of Vibration Parameters on Speech Persuasion",
      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

      "content": "While vibrotactile displays continue to gain popularity, it remains that the phenomenon of tactile change blindness negatively impacts the human ability to detect changes between and within tactile signals. This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",
