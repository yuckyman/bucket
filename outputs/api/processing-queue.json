      "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
      "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

      "content": "Accurate pose estimation underpins quantitative analysis of behavior, yet many deep learning-based tracking tools remain optimized for offline workflows that rely on fragmented software pipelines, workstation-grade GPUs, or external middleware to enable real-time deployment. Here we present an integrated software-hardware ecosystem for pose estimation that spans dataset creation, model training, offline analysis, and real-time deployment on embedded edge-computing devices. SqueakPose Studio provides a software suite for whole-frame, deep learning-based pose estimation that unifies dataset creation, manual and model-assisted labeling, model training, validation, and large-scale offline inference. The system leverages modern object-detection architectures to enable efficient end-to-end training and inference without patch-based sampling or multi-stage postprocessing, and supports execution on CPUs, GPUs, and Apple Silicon. For experimental settings requiring continuous recording and synchronized data acquisition, SqueakView enables real-time model deployment, video capture, and sensor logging on embedded edge-computing hardware, while MouseHouse provides a compact, modular enclosure designed for home cage-based experiments that integrates embedded GPU compute, microcontroller-based timing, and peripheral I/O. A shared data format and deterministic timing architecture ensure consistency across offline analysis and real-time deployment. Together, SqueakPose Studio, SqueakView, and MouseHouse provide a unified platform for pose estimation that supports both conventional offline analysis and embedded, real-time experimentation, without reliance on workstation-grade hardware or external middleware.",

      "title": "Predicting driver distraction using a single channel ear EEG",
      "content": "Cognitive distraction poses a major risk to driving safety, yet remains difficult to detect in real time because it often lacks overt behavioral markers. Neurophysiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG) provide objective indices of cognitive load, but conventional EEG systems are impractical for real-world deployment due to their intrusiveness and computational demands. The present study examined whether cognitive distraction during naturalistic driving can be decoded using a single-channel, non-invasive in-ear EEG, and how its temporal dynamics compare with those obtained from full-cap scalp EEG and behavioral measures. Twenty-seven participants performed a dual-task paradigm in a highly immersive driving simulator, combining continuous vehicle control with low- and high-load arithmetic tasks presented on an in-vehicle display. Single-channel in-ear EEG, 24-channel scalp EEG, eye movements, and head rotation were recorded concurrently. Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis was applied to decode working-memory load with millisecond precision across modalities. Cognitive distraction was reliably decoded from in-ear EEG, with detection latency and temporal generalization profiles closely matching those of full-cap scalp EEG. Although peak decoding performance was higher for scalp EEG, the timing and temporal stability of distraction-related neural signatures were largely overlapping between the two neural modalities. Eye velocity provided the earliest and most sensitive behavioral marker of distraction, while head rotation contributed complementary but weaker information. Scalp EEG topographies indicated that neural signals underlying decoding were closely linked to oculomotor and visuomotor processes engaged during task performance. These findings demonstrate that single-channel in-ear EEG provides a temporally precise and low-burden neural marker of cognitive distraction during driving. By prioritizing early detection and minimal hardware over maximal classification accuracy, the results identify a practical operating point for wearable EEG-based driver monitoring systems and support the feasibility of fast, off-the-shelf decoding approaches for real-world applications.",

      "title": "A Primary Central Source Determines Perturbation-Evoked N1 Amplitudes but not Latencies in Younger Adults",
      "content": "The balance perturbation-evoked N1 potential is a reliable cortical response during reactive balance control that is correlated to a variety of cognitive and motor functions. Although the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been identified as the primary source of the N1, it is less understood whether other brain regions contribute to N1 recorded at the scalp. We used source localization on electroencephalography (EEG) data from 25 younger adults recorded during backward whole-body perturbations during stance. We identified the sources that contribute to channel-based N1 recordings and quantified their impact on N1 amplitude and latency. In younger adults, N1 amplitudes can be explained by one single source in a central midline cortical region covering the SMA. When reconstructing N1 signals using backprojections with one versus all independent components (IC) identified as brain sources there was no difference in peak amplitudes and a small but significant difference in N1 peak latencies. Parallel brain sources thus deflect the time course of the N1, but not its magnitude. Brain areas associated with IC's contributing to the shift in N1 latency varied between participants. Our results emphasize the dominant influence of central cortical areas on the N1 response, informing hypothesizes regarding the nature of the signal and its functional role. Importantly, the extent and location of other cortical structures that influence N1 timing, such as parietal cortex areas and the anterior cingulate cortex, may further elucidate cortical contributions to balance. These markers could be crucial for the early detection of balance problems in clinical populations.",

      "title": "A pretrained foundation model for headache disorders based on magnetoencephalography",
      "content": "Objective. Foundation models have demonstrated transformative potential in medical artificial intelligence but remain underexplored in functional neuroimaging, particularly magnetoencephalography (MEG). This study aims to develop a domain-specific, self-supervised MEG clinical foundation model tailored for headache disorders to address the challenges of high-dimensional data and limited labeled datasets in clinical research. Approach. We developed a transformer-based model pretrained on a large-scale dataset comprising multi-state MEG recordings (resting-state, auditory, and somatosensory stimulation) from 416 participants (362 headache patients and 54 healthy controls). The model utilized a self-supervised masked-signal reconstruction strategy to learn latent spatiotemporal representations of neural activity. We evaluated the model\u2019s performance through signal reconstruction, visualization of attention weights, and downstream classification tasks comparing model-derived features against original MEG signals for migraine diagnosis. Main results. The pretrained model successfully reconstructed both continuous MEG signals and stimulus-specific evoked responses, effectively capturing intrinsic spatiotemporal brain dynamics. Visualization of the model\u2019s attention weights demonstrated spatial alignment with corresponding sensory brain regions, confirming its neurophysiological interpretability. Furthermore, classifiers trained on features extracted from the pretrained model significantly outperformed those using original MEG signals in identifying migraine patients, revealing distinct neural response patterns. Significance. This study introduces a scalable, data-efficient framework for clinical MEG analysis that significantly reduces reliance on manual feature extraction and labeled data. It demonstrates the efficacy of foundation models in decoding complex neural dynamics, offering promising implications for understanding neuropathology and facilitating precision diagnostics in neurology.",

      "title": "Chemogenetic modulation of PAC1-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) alters anxiety-related behaviors in male mice.",
      "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

      "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

      "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
      "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Post-Decision Outcome Expectation and Evaluation in Human Sensorimotor Choice Behavior",
      "content": "The concept of embodied sensorimotor decision-making proposes that processes implicated in evaluating sensory inputs and selecting appropriate motor actions unfold partly in cortical regions traditionally associated with movement planning and execution. Reinforcement learning models emphasize the role of reward prediction error (RPE) in optimizing action selection based on decision outcome feedback. However, most evidence for the existence of RPE signals locates them in midline frontal and parietal cortex, and comes from tasks with externally manipulated reward probabilities that create artificial prediction errors. Whether RPE signals are expressed in human cortical motor areas during deterministic (non-probabilistic) tasks remains unclear, and would provide further support for embodied decision-making. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study post-decision neural dynamics in a color discrimination task in selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs). Participants had to press buttons with their left or right index finger in response to checkerboard stimuli with different levels of color evidence for the correct choice. Outcomes were fully determined by participants' choices. Delayed auditory feedback veridically indicated whether their hand choice was correct or not. We observed a robust beta-band (15-29 Hz) rebound after correct outcome feedback, strongest in ventral and dorsal premotor, anterior cingulate and superior parietal ROIs as well as occipital and auditory ROIs, and weakest in the primary motor and somatosensory ROIs. Critically, the rebound magnitude after correct feedback scaled inversely with color evidence strength and associated decision error rates. It was minimal in strong-evidence trials (~0.1% errors) and maximal in weak-evidence trials (~34% errors), resembling a context-sensitive positive RPE signal that was strongest when a correct outcome was least expected. Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) post-feedback rebound increases in weak evidence trials were not as strong as in the beta band and appeared mainly in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. After the decision but before feedback, both beta and alpha band power showed sensitivity to the level of sensory evidence on which the decisions had been based, with reduced post-movement rebound or enhanced suppression in trials with weak evidence, suggestive of internally generated outcome expectations. Pre-feedback alpha rebound suppression was strongest in occipital, superior parietal and posterior cingulate ROIs. Pre-feedback beta rebound suppression was not as strong. Together, these findings reveal distinct beta- and alpha-band dynamics that reflect internal pre-feedback outcome expectations and feedback-driven RPE-like outcome assessments. They support distributed cortical mechanisms, including premotor, parietal and cingulate regions, in reward expectation, outcome evaluation, and adaptive control, highlighting a role for motor and associative cortices in embodied decision-making, performance monitoring, and flexible behavior under uncertainty.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease whose etiology is poorly understood and for which current treatments provide only modest control of symptoms. To better investigate the causes and progression of the disease, the transgenic TgF344-AD rat model has emerged as a crucial tool. In this paper, we collect observations on the accumulation of amyloid-{beta}, changes in neuronal density, and a decline in cognitive performance in TgF344-AD and wild-type rats. We develop a compartmental ordinary differential equation model and determine its parameters by fitting the output to the experimental observations. Our model simulations support the hypothesis that the accumulation of amyloid-{beta} leads to a rapid decline in neuronal density followed by a significant loss in memory and learning ability. Our mathematical model can provide a bridge between AD research in rodent models and the human condition of AD.",

      "title": "A Population Vector Model of Visual Working Memory for Real-World Scenes",
      "content": "Visual working memory is essential for navigating through and interacting with complex real-world environments. It is therefore important to understand how natural visual inputs - characterized by complex contours, continuously varying feature gradients, and spatial relationships - are represented in working memory. However, most research in this field has focused on simplified arrays of discrete artificial objects, favoring experimental control and modeling simplicity over ecological validity. This has led to quantitative models of working memory that require inputs consisting of easily parsed objects defined by a single value along one or more simple feature dimensions. It is not clear how these models could be updated to represent complex, photograph-like scenes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a population vector model of working memory that was designed specifically for real-world scenes. This model represents a scene as a noisy vector of neural firing rates across one or more areas of the ventral pathway, as estimated by a deep neural network model. We show that this model can account for both variations in behavioral performance and patterns of brain activity in tasks that require storing naturalistic scenes in working memory. These results demonstrate the viability of our general modeling approach, setting the stage for more sophisticated models that can fully account for the storage of real-world scenes in working memory.",

      "title": "History-dependent ephaptic interactions in paired olfactory receptor neurons",
      "content": "Olfactory sensing begins with the transduction of odors into receptor currents on the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). In insects and many other arthropods, ORNs are grouped stereotypically in hair-like sensilla on the surface of olfactory organs, enabling mutual inhibition through non-synaptic 'ephaptic' interactions (NSIs). Given the electrical, and therefore virtually instantaneous, nature of NSIs, it has been hypothesized that they contribute to processing fast temporal elements of mixed odor plumes. Here, we present single sensillum recordings and computational modeling that characterize NSIs during short offset dual-odor stimulations in the olfactory sensilla of adult female Drosophila melanogaster. We find in the experiments that the magnitude of inhibition between co-housed ORNs cannot be predicted by their instantaneous activity (firing rate) alone. It is adaptation-dependent, with strong effects only occurring when the inhibited ORN is adapted. This limits the usefulness of NSIs for fast odor processing when ORNs lack time to adapt. We reproduced the observed phenomena in a computational model and use this model to explain how the adaptation-dependence of NSI-mediated inhibition arises from nonlinearities in neural responses. We conclude that NSIs are unlikely to support the encoding of fast temporal dynamics in mixed odor stimuli, instead contributing to slower peripheral processing, supporting roles such as novelty detection. More broadly, we demonstrate how the nonlinear interactions of fairly simple electrical components lead to non-intuitive results, offering insight into the longstanding debate around ephaptic interactions in other systems, such as the mammalian CNS.",
