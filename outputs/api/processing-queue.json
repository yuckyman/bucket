      "content": "To address the mismatch between current ankle rehabilitation robots and natural human motion, which affects rehabilitation efficacy, this paper uses screw theory and motion capture experiments to identify the instantaneous finite helical motion axis (IFHA) of the human ankle joint. It determines the distribution law of the IFHA and twist pitch (TP) of the ankle, and designs a human-machine motion compatible rope-driven ankle joint rehabilitation robot that meets the needs of human ankle joint rehabilitation. Firstly, human ankle motion trajectories are captured using the VICON system and IMU, and the experimental data are processed according to screw theory to obtain the distribution law of the IFHA and the range of TP. Secondly, the ankle joint's motion characteristics from the experiment inform the constraint characteristics of the rehabilitation mechanism, which are then mapped into a novel parallel rope-driven ankle rehabilitation robot to meet rehabilitation needs. Thirdly, the kinematic model of the novel mechanism is established, and its kinematic performance and singular configurations are analyzed based on the motion/force transmission index, guiding the optimization of the driving rope layout and mechanism scale parameters. Finally, an experimental platform is built to validate the human-machine motion compatibility, safety, comfort, and effectiveness of the rehabilitation robot.",

      "title": "GONet: A Generalizable Deep Learning Model for Glaucoma Detection",
      "content": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), affecting an estimated 64.3 million people globally, causes irreversible vision loss when not detected early. Traditional diagnosis requires time-consuming ophthalmic examinations by specialists. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from colour fundus photographs (CFP) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119\u2009000 CFPs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.88-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 18.4%. GONet is available via Lirot.ai (www.aimlab-technion.com/lirot-ai). We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 747 CFPs with GON labels as open access, available at https://doi.org/10.13026/pdxv-m215.",

      "title": "Phase Correction of MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data Using Model-Based Signal Estimation and Extrapolation",
      "content": "Objective: To develop an effective method for phase correction of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. Methods: In many MRSI applications, it is desirable to generate absorption-mode spectra, which requires correction of phase errors in the measured MRSI data. Conventional phase correction methods are sensitive to measurement noise and baseline distortion, often resulting in distorted absorption-mode spectra from MRSI data with low-SNR and long acquisition dead time. This paper proposed a novel model-based method for improved phase correction of MRSI data. The proposed method determined the zeroth-order phase and acquisition dead time using a Lorentzian-based spectral model and performed signal extrapolation using a generalized series model. Absorption-mode spectra were then generated from the phase-corrected and extrapolated MRSI data. Results: The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated data and experimental data acquired from human subjects in multi-nuclei (31P, 2H, and 1H) MRSI experiments. Simulation results demonstrated improved parameter estimation accuracy by the proposed method under various noise levels and dead times. The proposed method also consistently generated high-quality absorption-mode spectra with minimal spectral distortions from experimental data. The proposed method was compared with state-of-the-art methods (including the entropy method and LCModel method) and showed more robust phase correction performance with less spectral distortions. Conclusion: This paper introduced a novel method for phase correction of MRSI data. Results from simulated and in vivo data demonstrated that high-quality absorption-mode spectra could be obtained using the proposed method. Significance: This method will provide a useful tool for processing MRSI data.",

      "title": "A Birdcage Volume Transmit Coil and 8 Channel Receive Array for Marmoset Brain Imaging at 7T",
      "content": "Objective: To design and fabricate a band-pass birdcage volume resonator and eight channel, conformal receive array coil for MRI of both awake and anesthetized marmoset brain at 7T. The coil is compatible with a whole body 7T clinical MRI scanner running in single channel transmit (sTx) mode. Methods: The marmoset head coil included a shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil with 24 legs, as well as 8 overlapped receive elements. Electromagnetic (EM) field simulation was performed for the 24 leg band pass birdcage Tx coil to calculate the B1+ efficiency. The efficacy of both transmit and receive coil designs were evaluated by measuring standard coil performance metrics. This was done while imaging a marmoset head phantom, as well as by acquiring in vivo, anesthetized and awake marmoset images. Results: The transmit coil along with the optimized receive array produced high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic for EPI images; 0.36 mm isotropic for structural images) and high SNR (between 50 and 80) images of the marmoset brain. The simulated B1+ efficiency of the birdcage at the center of the phantom was 2.6 \u00b5T/sqrt (W). Conclusion and significance: A shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil was designed and fabricated for marmoset brain imaging at 7T. An 8-channel receive array consisting of eight overlapped loops, covering the whole brain of the marmoset, was also constructed and applied for signal reception. The system successfully allowed scanning of both young and older marmosets. It is well-suited for longitudinal studies of marmoset brain structure. The coil advantageously allows the study of neurodevelopment and primate brain function.",

      "content": "Objective: To develop a transceiver radio frequency (RF) coil optimized for high resolution small-animal imaging at 14.1 T, aimed at enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Methods: A hybrid distributed capacitance (HDC) birdcage coil was designed, combining conventional endring lumped capacitors with distributed capacitance along the legs, implemented using double-layer copper-clad substrates. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations were employed to optimize the coil's structural parameters and capacitance values for maximum RF performance. The HDC birdcage coil's performance was evaluated against a conventional bandpass (BP) design through electromagnetic simulations, bench tests, and phantom imaging. In vivo validation was performed using mouse imaging. Results: EM simulations demonstrated that the HDC design enhances mean $\\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ and $\\text{B}_{1}^{-}$ field strengths by 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, relative to the conventional BP design. The HDC design also showed reduced electric field (E-field) value in phantom, with 4.2% lower mean and 11.4% lower maximum E-field value. Bench measurements revealed a superior quality factor (Q factor) for the HDC coil, with a 34.2% higher unloaded Q value compared to the conventional design. Phantom imaging confirmed a 41% SNR improvement with the HDC design. The optimized HDC coil enabled mouse brain imaging at 50 $ \\!\\!\\mu \\!\\!\\text{ m}$ resolution.Conclusion: The proposed HDC birdcage coil demonstrated superior receiver sensitivity and Q factor compared to conventional designs, yielding significant SNR improvements in 14.1 T imaging. Significance: The results demonstrated the feasibility of achieving enhanced coil performance through HDC design at ultra-high field strength, providing a promising approach for improving image quality in small-animal MRI applications.",

      "title": "Enhancing SSVEP-BCI performance through multi-stimulus discriminant fusion analysis",
      "content": "Objective. To enhance frequency recognition in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), particularly under short data acquisition and complex environmental conditions. Approach. We propose multi-stimulus discriminant fusion analysis (MSDFA), a novel method that integrates multi-stimulus strategies with discriminant modeling. MSDFA was evaluated on two public datasets (Benchmark and BETA) and compared with conventional approaches including eCCA, eTRCA, and their variants. Main results. MSDFA consistently outperformed existing methods across different data lengths and training block quantities. It achieved maximum information transfer rates of 247.17\u2009\u00b1\u200910.15\u2009bpm on the Benchmark dataset and 192.72\u2009\u00b1\u20099.44\u2009bpm on the BETA dataset, demonstrating superior robustness and efficiency. Significance. By combining complementary algorithmic strengths, MSDFA improves adaptability to individual variability and complex environments, advancing the practical utility and reliability of SSVEP-BCI systems.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/PSnT0EN\">https://imgur.com/PSnT0EN</a></p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m the kind of developer who either forgets to commit for hours or ends up with a git log full of &quot;update,&quot; &quot;fix,&quot; and &quot;asdf.&quot; I wanted a way to document my progress without breaking my flow. This is a background watcher that handles the documentation for me.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>This tool is a local automation script built with Watchdog and Subprocess. It monitors a project directory for file saves. When you hit save, it:</p> <ol> <li>Detects the modified file.</li> <li>Extracts the diff between the live file and the last committed version using git show HEAD.</li> <li>Sends the versions to Groq (Llama-3.1-8b-instant) for a sub-second summary.</li> <li>Automatically runs git add and git commit locally.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s designed for developers who want a high-granularity history during rapid prototyping. It keeps the &quot;breadcrumb trail&quot; intact while you\u2019re in the flow, so you can look back and see exactly how a feature evolved without manual documentation effort. It is strictly for local development and does not perform any git push operations.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most auto-committers use generic timestamps or static messages, which makes history useless for debugging. Existing AI commit tools usually require a manual CLI command (e.g., git ai-commit). This project differs by being fully passive; it reacts to your editor's save event, requiring zero context switching once the script is running.</p> <p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></p> <p>While this utilizes an LLM for message generation, the focus is the Python-driven orchestration of the Git workflow.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> Uses watchdog for low-level OS file events.</li> <li><strong>Git Integration:</strong> Manages state through the subprocess module, handling edge cases like new/untracked files and preventing infinite commit loops.</li> <li><strong>Modular Design:</strong> The AI is treated as a pluggable component; the prompt logic is isolated so it could be replaced by a local regex parser or a different local LLM model.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Link to Source Code:</strong><br /> <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2FDDecoene%2Fa27f68416e5eec217f84cb375fee7d70\">https://gist.github.com/DDecoene/a27f68416e5eec217f84cb375fee7d70</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MidnightBolt\"> /u/MidnightBolt </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pyly13/i_built_an_automated_git_documentation_tool_using/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pyly13/i_built_an_automated_git_documentation_tool_using/\">[comments]</a></span>",
