      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

      "title": "Neuropacify: a method to transform and match a patient\u2019s intracranial EEG to their NeuroPace RNS system data",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop responsive neurostimulators, such as the NeuroPace responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system, continuously monitor brain activity and deliver electrical stimulation in response to abnormal electrographic activity in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Practical technical constraints limit the temporal resolution of these devices, reducing the quality of EEG recordings. Approach. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to convert high-resolution intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) obtained from inpatient monitoring into the same format, parameters, and resolution produced by the RNS system, allowing direct comparison of iEEG with RNS system data. We validated this technique using data from patients who had both iEEG and RNS. Electrodes from the iEEG and RNS system were co-registered onto the same 3D coordinate grid, and vector math was applied to determine the iEEG electrodes closest to the operational RNS electrodes. Main results. Through spectral analysis, we derived a transfer function that accounts for all filtering and data processing produced by the RNS system. Comparison of the recorded data using visual and spectral analysis from iEEG and RNS confirmed that EEG characteristics were correctly transformed by the filtering function, allowing analysis of how iEEG signals would appear within the RNS system. We demonstrate two examples from the extreme edges of the spectra, showing how DC shifts and high frequency oscillations would be transformed by the RNS. We provide a tutorial to tune this method to local device parameters, a process that can be applied to other devices as well. Significance. This tool allows researchers and clinicians to extract EEG biomarkers from high-resolution iEEG and determine if/how they can be detected in lower-resolution RNS. This provides an opportunity to develop patient-specific seizure detection parameters and investigate the long-term effects of neurostimulation therapy.",

And it already supported Rust (crates.io), JavaScript/TypeScript (npm), and Elixir (Hex) packages, including in mixed setups.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Sampo comes as a <a href=\"https://github.com/bruits/sampo/tree/main/crates/sampo\">CLI tool</a>, a <a href=\"https://github.com/bruits/sampo/tree/main/crates/sampo-github-action\">GitHub Action</a>, and a <a href=\"https://github.com/apps/sampo-s-bot\">GitHub App</a>. It automatically discovers <code>pyproject.toml</code> in your workspace, enforces <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a> (SemVer), helps you write user-facing changesets, consumes them to generate changelogs, bumps package versions accordingly, and automates your release and publishing process.</p> <p>It\u2019s fully open source, and easy to opt in and opt out. We\u2019re also open to contributions to extend support to other Python registries and/or package managers.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>The project is still in its initial development versions <code>(0.x.x)</code>, so expect some rough edges. However, its core features are already here, and breaking changes should be minimal going forward.</p> <p>It\u2019s particularly well-suited to multi-ecosystem monorepos (e.g. mixing Python and TypeScript packages), organisations with repos across several ecosystems (that want a consistent release workflow everywhere), or maintainers who are struggling to keep changelogs and releases under control.</p> <p>I\u2019d say the project is starting to be production-ready: we use it for our various open-source projects (Sampo of course, but also <a href=\"https://github.com/bruits/maudit/\">Maudit</a>), my previous company still uses it in production, and others (like PostHog) are evaluating adoption.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Sampo is deeply inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/changesets/changesets\">Changesets</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/lerna/lerna\">Lerna</a>, from which we borrow the changeset format and monorepo release workflows. But our project goes beyond the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, as it is made with Rust, and designed to support multiple mixed ecosystems. Other npm-limited tools include <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack\">Rush</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/algolia/shipjs\">Ship.js</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/release-it/release-it\">Release It!</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/beachball\">beachball</a>.</p> <p>Google's <a href=\"https://github.com/googleapis/release-please\">Release Please</a> is ecosystem-agnostic, but lacks publishing capabilities, and is not monorepo-focused. Also, it uses <a href=\"https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\">Conventional Commits</a> messages to infer changes instead of explicit changesets, which confuses the technical history (used and written by contributors) with the API changelog (used by users, can be written/reviewed by product/docs owner). Other commit-based tools include <a href=\"https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release\">semantic-release</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/intuit/auto\">auto</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/knope-dev/knope\">Knope</a> is an ecosystem-agnostic tool inspired by Changesets, but lacks publishing capabilities, and is more config-heavy. But we are thankful for their open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/knope-dev/changesets\">changeset parser</a> that we reused in Sampo!</p> <p>To our knowledge, no other tool automates versioning, changelogs, and publishing, with explicit changesets, and multi-ecosystem support.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.06516v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Consumer-grade biosensors offer a cost-effective alternative to medical-grade electromyography (EMG) systems, reducing hardware costs from thousands of dollars to approximately $13. However, these low-cost sensors introduce significant signal instability and motion artifacts. Deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained edge devices like the ESP32 presents a challenge: balancing classification accuracy with strict latency (<100ms) and memory (<320KB) constraints. Using a single-subject dataset comprising 1,540 seconds of raw data (1.54M data points, segmented into ~1,300 one-second windows), I evaluate 18 model architectures, ranging from statistical heuristics to deep transfer learning (ResNet50) and custom hybrid networks (MaxCRNN). While my custom \"MaxCRNN\" (Inception + Bi-LSTM + Attention) achieved the highest safety (99% Precision) and robustness, I identify Random Forest (74% accuracy) as the Pareto-optimal solution for embedded control on legacy microcontrollers. I demonstrate that reliable, low-latency EMG control is feasible on commodity hardware, with Deep Learning offering a path to near-perfect reliability on modern Edge AI accelerators.",

      "title": "Inflammatory signaling differentially changes chromatin accessibility and gene expression of the PD- associated kinase LRRK2 between human and mice",
      "content": "The genomic locus that encodes the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene is highly pleiotropic, being associated with both Parkinsons disease (PD) and Crohns disease (CD). Coding variants associated with risk of PD and CD act as gain of function kinase mutations increasing phosphorylation of RAB substrates, and non-coding variants in the promoter region of LRRK2 increase expression of the gene, notably in immune cells. If regulation of LRRK2 expression is a causal contributor to age-related diseases, it is important to understand the mechanism(s) by which LRRK2 is regulated, particularly in the context of inflammation. Here, we show that interferon-gamma exposure induces robust LRRK2 activation in human iPSC derived microglia through signaling of the Janus-activated Kinase complex to phosphorylate STAT1, which then binds to the LRRK2 promoter and is associated with remodeling of chromatin structure in this genomic locus. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the stress-induced transcription factor and long non-coding RNA encoded at the same locus, resulting in increased LRRK2 mRNA levels. We also show evidence of the same effect in acutely cultured human brain slices. While we were unable to demonstrate any induction of Lrrk2 mRNA in the mouse brain, the introduction of a human bacterial artificial chromosome transgene into the mouse genome recapitulated sensitivity to interferon-gamma in microglia. A comparative genomic analysis across mammals suggests that these species differences are driven by regulatory regions upstream of LRRK2 that are specific to anthropoid primates. These results demonstrate that there are differences between species in how genes associated with human diseases are regulated and provide important information that should be incorporated in disease modeling.",

      "title": "Location and mapping of the human rostromedial tegmental nucleus and associated midbrain inhibitory nuclei regulating dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Background: Animal experiments reveal distinct GABAergic cell clusters within the dopaminergic midbrain regions in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and retrorubral fields (RRF) that have yet to be clearly defined in humans. These neurons send prominent inhibitory projections to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area that impact motor, reward and threat processing. Objective: To identify GABergic RMTg and RRF cell clusters in the human brain. Methods: Ten m formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded transverse human brainstem sections from ten control cases were obtained from the Sydney Brain Bank and immunohistochemistry for GABA and tyrosine hydroxylase was used to determine the location and cell size of RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons. These cell populations were further mapped in transverse 50m thick cresyl violet stained serial midbrain sections (every 750m) from previously published controls (Halliday et al. 1990a). Results: GABAergic neurons were cytoarchitecturally distinct, with the largest GABAergic neurons in the RRF, followed by RMTg neurons which were larger than GABAergic neurons in the interpedunclular nucleus (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons first appear in caudal transverse midbrain sections approximately 38mm above the obex. RMTg moves rostrally and medially from underneath the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle to just lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus. The RRF cluster also moves rostrally and medially to the parabrachial pigmented nucleus (PBP) just under the red nucleus. Conclusion: The GABAergic neurons in RMTg and RRF/PBP that modulate dopamine neuronal excitability have distinct morphologies in humans. Identifying these inhibitory neurons is key to evaluating their role in neurodegenerative diseases.",
