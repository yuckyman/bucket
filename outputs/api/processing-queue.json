      "title": "Rendering Affective Touch With an Array of Pneumatic Unit Cell Actuators",
      "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

      "title": "Monolingual, Non-tone Bilingual, and Tone Bilingual Infants: Language Experiences Alter Speech and Nonspeech Perception",
      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

      "title": "Oscillatory Correlates of Metacontrol: Beta and Theta Band Contributions to Feedback-dependent Cognitive Adaptation",
      "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

      "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
      "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

      "title": "The mood stabilizer lithium alters behaviour and physiology via the gut brain axis.",
      "content": "Lithium, introduced 75 years ago by John Cade1, remains the most effective mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder2. Lithium is proposed to modulate an array of cellular pathways, many ubiquitous to all cells, with pleiotropic roles unlinked to bipolar disorder or lithium responsiveness in genome wide association studies3,4. These mechanisms cannot explain lithium's specific effects on mood and behaviour. We demonstrate that lithium's primary action is in the periphery, not in the brain itself. Lithium acts in the gut to trigger behavioural and physiological changes, akin to those associated with a torpor-like state, that protect individuals from ingested toxins. Lithium activates gastrointestinal enterochromaffin (EC) cells via their Trpm2 cation channels to modulate afferent vagal and area postrema inputs to the brain. Eliminating these inputs by focal brain lesions eliminates lithium's effects, as does ablation of EC cells or their Trpm2 expression. Lithium's Trpm2-dependent activation of EC cells also occurs in human gut tissue, providing translational relevance for our discovery. These findings challenge the prevailing perception that lithium acts directly on the brain. Via a previously unsuspected gut-brain pathway, lithium engages brain circuitry that reduces arousal and interaction with the external world, therapeutic goals in the manic phase of bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Dynamic conformational ensembles of soluble Tau encode neuronal toxicity prior to aggregation",
      "content": "Tau aggregation is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, yet the conformational states of Tau in neurons prior to aggregation remain poorly understood. Existing structural models are derived largely from fibrillar assemblies and provide limited insight into the dynamic, soluble Tau species that initiate pathology. Here, we combine hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry with super-resolution imaging and neuronal models to define the conformational ensemble of soluble Tau under physiological and disease-relevant conditions. We show that soluble Tau populates distinct, dynamic conformations characterized by regional stabilization and long-range intramolecular interactions that are invisible to fibril-based structures. Disease-associated perturbations selectively remodel these conformational ensembles, exposing aggregation-prone regions and altering Tau subcellular organization in neurons. Notably, these Tau species inhibit axonal transport, which is essential for neuronal health, linking specific ensemble states to neuronal toxicity. These findings establish soluble Tau conformation as a dynamic, regulatable state that precedes aggregation and encodes disease relevance. By defining the structural logic of Tau before fibril formation, this work provides a framework for understanding early tauopathy mechanisms and for targeting Tau pathology at its earliest stages.",

      "title": "HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface With Hierarchical Force Control",
      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "title": "\u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d: Studying the Influence of Vibration Parameters on Speech Persuasion",
      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

      "content": "While vibrotactile displays continue to gain popularity, it remains that the phenomenon of tactile change blindness negatively impacts the human ability to detect changes between and within tactile signals. This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

      "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
      "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",
