      "title": "The Ranking Effect: How Algorithmic Rank Influences Attention on Social Media",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.18440v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social media feeds have become central to the Internet. Among the most visible are trending feeds, which rank content deemed timely and relevant. To examine how feed signals influence behaviors and perceptions, we conducted a randomized experiment (n = 585) simulating Reddit's r/popular feed. By having participants view identical sets of posts in different orders, we isolate the effects of rank and social proof on engagement and perceived relevance, trustworthiness, and quality. We found that lower-ranked posts received about 40% less engagement, despite participants rarely reporting rank as a factor in their choices. In contrast, neither rank nor social proof shifted perceptions across the three dimensions. We also observed demographic patterns: older participants were more skeptical of trending content, while those with less formal education expressed greater trust. Overall, our findings show that algorithmic curation implicitly steers attention, with implications for platform design, research on algorithmic influence, and policy.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Online communities are constantly growing, with dozens of platforms housing millions of users. Large and small communities alike rely on volunteer moderators to maintain order. Despite their key role, moderators are given a toolbox of punishments and asked to fend off barrages of harmful content. However, prior research shows that positive feedback may proactively encourage higher quality contributions and discourage norm violations. Moreover, moderators themselves have requested support for locating and rewarding content to encourage in their communities. These requests notwithstanding, there is a tangible lack of practical support through tools. Building off moderators' ideas, we build a novel moderation system, the Positive Queue, that augments Reddit's existing moderator interface with features to discover and reward desirable content. Through a user study of moderators, we find that the system has value to vastly different moderation settings. We present design directions and insights for incorporating positive moderation strategies into existing spaces.",

      "title": "When Collaborative Maintenance Falls Short: The Persistence of Retracted Papers on Wikipedia",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.18403v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Wikipedia serves as a key infrastructure for public access to scientific knowledge, but it faces challenges in maintaining the credibility of cited sources, especially when scientific papers are retracted. This paper investigates how citations to retracted research are handled on English Wikipedia. We construct a novel dataset that integrates Wikipedia revision histories with metadata from Retraction Watch, Crossref, Altmetric, and OpenAlex, identifying 1,181 citations of retracted papers. We find that 71.6% of all citations analyzed are problematic. These are citations added before a paper's retraction, as well as the citations introduced after retraction without any in-text mention of the paper's retracted status. Our analysis reveals that these citations persist for a median of over 3.68 years (1,344 days). Through survival analysis, we find that signals of human attention are associated with a faster correction process. Unfortunately, a paper's established scholarly authority, a higher academic citation count, is associated with a slower time to correction. Our findings highlight how the Wikipedia community supports collaborative maintenance but leaves gaps in citation-level repair. We contribute to CSCW research by advancing our understanding of this sociotechnical vulnerability, which takes the form of a community coordination challenge, and by offering design directions to support citation credibility at scale.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18391v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visual assistive technologies, such as Microsoft Seeing AI, can improve access to environmental information for persons with blindness or low vision (pBLV). Yet, the physical and functional implications of different device embodiments remain unclear. In this study, 11 pBLV participants used Seeing AI on a hand-held smartphone and on a head-mounted ARx Vision system to perform six activities of daily living, while their movements were captured with Xsens motion capture. Functional outcomes included task time, success rate, and number of attempts, and biomechanical measures included joint range of motion, angular path length, working volume, and movement smoothness. The head-mounted system generally reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for document-scanning style tasks, whereas the hand-held system yielded higher success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. These findings indicate that both embodiments are viable, but they differ in terms of physical demands and ease of use. Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology evaluations can inform designs that optimise user experience by balancing functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18297v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Qualitative research offers deep insights into human experiences, but its processes, such as coding and thematic analysis, are time-intensive and laborious. Recent advancements in qualitative data analysis (QDA) tools have introduced AI capabilities, allowing researchers to handle large datasets and automate labor-intensive tasks. However, qualitative researchers have expressed concerns about AI's lack of contextual understanding and its potential to overshadow the collaborative and interpretive nature of their work. This study investigates researchers' preferences among three degrees of delegation of AI in QDA (human-only, human-initiated, and AI-initiated coding) and explores factors influencing these preferences. Through interviews with 16 qualitative researchers, we identified efficiency, ownership, and trust as essential factors in determining the desired degree of delegation. Our findings highlight researchers' openness to AI as a supportive tool while emphasizing the importance of human oversight and transparency in automation. Based on the results, we discuss three factors of trust in AI for QDA and potential ways to strengthen collaborative efforts in QDA and decrease bias during analysis.",

      "content": "arXiv:2505.10571v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, we demonstrate that they lack a fundamental aspect of human cognition: working memory. Human working memory is an active cognitive system that enables not only the temporary storage of information but also its processing and utilization, enabling coherent reasoning and decision-making. Without working memory, individuals may produce unrealistic responses, exhibit self-contradictions, and struggle with tasks that require mental reasoning. Existing evaluations using N-back or context-dependent tasks fall short as they allow LLMs to exploit external context rather than retaining the reasoning process in the latent space. We introduce three novel tasks: (1) Number Guessing, (2) Yes-No Deduction, and (3) Math Magic, designed to isolate internal representation from external context. Across seventeen frontier models spanning four major model families, we consistently observe irrational or contradictory behaviors, indicating LLMs' inability to retain and manipulate latent information. Our work establishes a new benchmark for evaluating working memory in LLMs and highlights this limitation as a key bottleneck for advancing reliable reasoning systems. Code and prompts for the experiments are available at https://github.com/penguinnnnn/LLM-Working-Memory.",

      "content": "arXiv:2409.04072v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder marked by memory loss and cognitive decline, making early detection vital for timely intervention. However, early diagnosis is challenging due to the heterogeneous presentation of symptoms. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) captures spontaneous brain activity and functional connectivity, which are known to be disrupted in AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have been used to calculate association matrices, but these approaches often overlook the dynamic and non-stationary nature of brain activity. In this study, we introduce a novel method that integrates discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and graph theory to model the dynamic behavior of brain networks. Our approach captures the time-frequency representation of brain activity, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of the underlying network dynamics. Machine learning was employed to automate the discrimination of different stages of AD based on learned patterns from brain network at different frequency bands. We applied our method to a dataset of rs-fMRI images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, demonstrating its potential as an early diagnostic tool for AD and for monitoring disease progression. Our statistical analysis identifies specific brain regions and connections that are affected in AD and MCI, at different frequency bands, offering deeper insights into the disease's impact on brain function.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18469v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data. Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally, PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear manifold.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.19254v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Non-ordinary states of consciousness (NOC) provide an opportunity to experience highly intense, unique, and perceptually rich subjective states. The neural mechanisms supporting these experiences remain poorly understood. This study examined brain activity associated with a self-induced, substance-free NOC known as Auto-Induced Cognitive Trance (AICT). Twenty-seven trained participants underwent high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during rest and AICT. We analyzed the aperiodic component of the power spectrum (1/f), Lempel-Ziv complexity, and sample entropy from five-minute signal segments. A machine learning approach was used to classify rest and AICT, identify discriminative features, and localize their sources. We also compared EEG metrics across conditions and assessed whether baseline activity predicted the magnitude of change during AICT. Classification analyses revealed condition-specific differences in spectral exponents, complexity, and entropy. The aperiodic component showed the strongest discriminative power, followed by entropy and complexity. Source localization highlighted frontal regions, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the left parietal cortex as key contributors to the AICT state. Baseline neural activity in frontal and parietal regions predicted individual variability in the transition from rest to AICT. These findings indicate that AICT engages brain regions implicated in rich subjective experiences and provide mechanistic insights into how self-induced trance states influence neural functioning.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18758v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.",

Existing assistive technologies present a trade-off: systems that offer precise guidance typically require pre-scanning or support only fixed object categories, while those with open-world object recognition lack spatial feedback for reaching the object. To address this gap, we introduce 'NaviSense', a mobile assistive system that combines conversational AI, vision-language models, augmented reality (AR), and LiDAR to support open-world object detection with real-time audio-haptic guidance. Users specify objects via natural language and receive continuous spatial feedback to navigate toward the target without needing prior setup. Designed with insights from a formative study and evaluated with 12 blind and low-vision participants, NaviSense significantly reduced object retrieval time and was preferred over existing tools, demonstrating the value of integrating open-world perception with precise, accessible guidance.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18662v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Strength training carries risk of injury when exercises are performed without supervision. While haptics research has advanced, there remains a gap in how to integrate on-body feedback into intelligent wearables. Developing such a design space requires experiencing feedback in context, yet obtaining functional systems is costly. By addressing these challenges, we introduce FlexGuard, a design space for on-body feedback to support injury prevention in strength training. The design space was derived from nine co-design workshops, where novice trainees and expert trainers DIY'd low-fidelity on-body feedback systems, tried them immediately, and surfaced needs and challenges encountered in real exercising contexts. We then evaluated the space through speed dating, using storyboards to cover the design dimensions. We followed up with workshops to further validate selected dimensions in practice through a proof-of-concept wearable system prototype. Our findings extend the design space for sports and fitness wearables in the context of strength training.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18641v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: If 100 people issue the same search query, they may have 100 different goals. While existing work on user-centric AI evaluation highlights the importance of aligning systems with fine-grained user intents, current search evaluation methods struggle to represent and assess this diversity. We introduce BloomIntent, a user-centric search evaluation method that uses user intents as the evaluation unit. BloomIntent first generates a set of plausible, fine-grained search intents grounded on taxonomies of user attributes and information-seeking intent types. Then, BloomIntent provides an automated evaluation of search results against each intent powered by large language models. To support practical analysis, BloomIntent clusters semantically similar intents and summarizes evaluation outcomes in a structured interface. With three technical evaluations, we showed that BloomIntent generated fine-grained, evaluable, and realistic intents and produced scalable assessments of intent-level satisfaction that achieved 72% agreement with expert evaluators. In a case study (N=4), we showed that BloomIntent supported search specialists in identifying intents for ambiguous queries, uncovering underserved user needs, and discovering actionable insights for improving search experiences. By shifting from query-level to intent-level evaluation, BloomIntent reimagines how search systems can be assessed -- not only for performance but for their ability to serve a multitude of user goals.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18498v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents a case study of the thematic pavilion null2 at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai, contrasting with the static Jomon motifs of Taro Okamoto's Tower of the Sun from Expo 1970. The study discusses Yayoi-inspired mirror motifs and dynamically transforming interactive spatial configuration of null2, where visitors become integrated as experiential content. The shift from static representation to a new ontological and aesthetic model, characterized by the visitor's body merging in real-time with architectural space at installation scale, is analyzed. Referencing the philosophical context of Expo 1970 theme 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind,' this research reconsiders the worldview articulated by null2 in Expo 2025, in which computation is naturalized and ubiquitous, through its intersection with Eastern philosophical traditions. It investigates how immersive experiences within the pavilion, grounded in the philosophical framework of Digital Nature, reinterpret traditional spatial and structural motifs of the tea room, positioning them within contemporary digital art discourse. The aim is to contextualize and document null2 as an important contemporary case study from Expo practices, considering the historical and social background in Japan from the 19th to 21st century, during which world expositions served as pivotal points for the birth of modern Japanese concept of 'fine art,' symbolic milestones of economic development, and key moments in urban and media culture formation. Furthermore, this paper academically organizes architectural techniques, computer graphics methodologies, media art practices, and theoretical backgrounds utilized in null2, highlighting the scholarly significance of preserving these as an archival document for future generations.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
      "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
      "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

      "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",
