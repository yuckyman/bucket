This paper is meant as a history of how the standard has developed and grown over time. We outline the principles behind the project, the mechanisms by which it has been extended, and some of the challenges being addressed as it evolves. We also discuss the lessons learned through the project, with the aim of enabling researchers in...",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

      "title": "Deciphering the mechanistic basis for the pathological effect of the G\u03b1o E246K mutation in neurodevelopmental disorder",
      "content": "Mutations in the GNAO1 gene, which encodes for Go, a major neuronal G protein, are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, epilepsy, and movement disorders. We identified and characterized a spontaneous heterozygous GNAO1 E246K mutation in an Israeli female infant with complex developmental delays and substantial motor difficulties. This mutation has been reported in other cases as a prevalent pathogenic mutation in patients with motor dysfunction and a broad range of neurological outcomes. To investigate the molecular and functional consequences of the Go E246K mutation, we employed structural modeling and analysis, biochemical assays, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and cellular functional assays. We show that this mutation does not affect nucleotide binding, nor basal or RGS-accelerated GTP hydrolysis. Despite the E246 position located within a predicted effector binding region, proteomics analysis did not identify any new cellular partners. Instead, we demonstrate that the E246K mutation disrupts the Go regulatory GTPase cycle by directly impairing G{beta}{gamma} dissociation. This impairment overrides the presence of wild-type Go, explaining the dominant effect of the severe neurogenetic phenotype in the heterozygous background. These findings establish a new molecular mechanism for a GNAO1 mutation with dominant-negative effects on the GTPase regulatory cycle. The insights gained from studying this mechanism of action provide a basis for developing specific and personalized therapeutic strategies based on the outcome of a missense mutation in GNAO1.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial dysfunction precedes neurodegeneration in DRPLA patient-derived neurons, and phenylbutyrate improves survival.",
      "content": "Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a progressive autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATN1 gene, which encodes the transcriptional corepressor Atrophin-1. The temporal sequence of molecular mechanisms driving neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in DRPLA is poorly understood, limiting therapeutic development. We generated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated them into cortical excitatory glutamatergic neurons to model early pathogenic processes. Early pathological features of DRPLA patient-derived neurons included mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. These alterations occurred before overt neuronal loss, highlighting bioenergetic stress as a key early driver of disease progression toward neurodegeneration. Pharmacological treatment with phenylbutyrate significantly improved neuronal survival and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. These findings challenge the conventional aggregation-centric model of polyglutamine disease pathogenesis and position mitochondrial stress as a central and early promoter of neuronal degeneration in DRPLA. By providing mechanistic insight into early-stage disease processes, our study lays the foundation for therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in DRPLA and related polyglutamine disorders.",
