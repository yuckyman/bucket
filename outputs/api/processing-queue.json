      "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Structural MRI provides a noninvasive window into brain morphology, yet the reproducibility and interpretability of morphometric analyses remain limited by inconsistent preprocessing, variable spatial alignment, and heterogeneous feature construction. We introduce MORPH2DIAG, a fully automated, atlas-free morphometric pipeline that integrates standardized preprocessing, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, data-driven subtyping, and machine- and deep-learning classification within a single, modular framework. The pipeline performs intensity normalization, morphological cleanup, PCA-informed affine alignment, isotropic rescaling, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) segmentation to generate quantitative gray-matter (GM), white-matter (WM), and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) maps. Global tissue fractions were used to derive latent neuroanatomical subtypes via unsupervised K-means clustering, revealing progressive GM--CSF gradients consistent with patterns commonly observed along normative-to-atrophic structural continua observed in neurodegeneration. To capture finer-grained spatial heterogeneity, a voxel-wise K-means parcellation yielded parcel-level intensity means and variances that served as regional morphometric descriptors. These global and parcel-level features were integrated into a unified evaluation suite comparing classical machine learning models (Random Forests, Logistic Regression, XGBoost) with lean, deep, and hybrid multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) trained using focal loss, label smoothing, stochastic weight averaging, and nested cross-validation with PCA-based dimensionality reduction. Across methods, the hybrid MLP achieved the highest macro-F1 and balanced accuracy, demonstrating strong discriminative performance for the discovered morphometric subtypes. Collectively, MORPH2DIAG establishes a fully automated, atlas-free framework that unites unsupervised structural subtype discovery with interpretable machine and deep learning, providing a reproducible foundation for MRI-based morphometric profiling and automated detection of neurodegenerative-like patterns.",

      "title": "The cost of dual-task walking: cognitive demands restrict visual search and gait planning",
      "content": "Adaptive walking relies on proactive visual search to plan foot placement and maintain stability. This study examined how cognitive load and task complexity affect gaze behaviour and gait biomechanics during a precision target-stepping task in healthy young adults. We also quantified the frequency of cross-stepping during the experimental task. Twenty-three participants (18-23 years) walked along an L-shaped pathway containing raised stepping targets under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. Targets had four different layouts to create high and low difficulty conditions. Eye movements were recorded using mobile eye-tracking, and gait kinematics were captured via motion capture. Compared with ST, DT walking produced slower walking speeds, longer stance times, and reduced velocity between stepping targets, indicating a more inefficient gait strategy. Eye-tracking analyses revealed fewer and shorter fixations on task-relevant targets and a greater number of fixations directed toward task-irrelevant areas under DT conditions. In DT, saccadic amplitudes were reduced despite increased outside fixations, suggesting a breakdown in visual exploration between proximal and distal regions of the walkway. Cross-stepping was more frequent in ST conditions than in DT. These findings indicate that increased cognitive load compromises proactive visual search, likely through working-memory and attentional limitations that disrupt feedforward gait planning. Contrary to expectation, cross-stepping occurred more often during ST than DT walking, suggesting that in this population cross-stepping may not be a maladaptive strategy. Overall, these results highlight the cognitive demands of adaptive walking even in young, low-risk individuals and underscore the importance of preserving visual-motor coordination under cognitive stress.",

It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "A method for the time-frequency analysis of high-order interactions in non-stationary physiological networks",
      "content": "Objective. Several data-driven approaches based on information theory have been proposed for analyzing high-order interactions (HOIs) involving three or more components of a network system. The existing methods do not account for temporal correlations in the data, or are defined only in the time domain and rely on the assumption of stationarity in the underlying dynamics, making them inherently unable to detect frequency-specific behaviors and track transient functional links in physiological networks. Approach. This study introduces a new framework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs in networks of random processes through the spectral representation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and frequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a recursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Main results. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyzes. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. The application to cardiovascular oscillations reveals a reduction in redundant information following head-up tilt, reflecting a functional disconnection within the physiological network of heart period, respiratory, and arterial pressure signals. Significance. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and time-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks. As our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the study of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in many network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other fields.",
