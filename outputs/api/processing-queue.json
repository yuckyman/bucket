      "title": "Altered striatal dopamine dynamics and behavior in Grin2a mutant mice, a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia",
      "content": "Schizophrenia (SCZ), a complex psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis, is thought to involve, at least in part, dopamine dysregulation in the striatum. Recent large-scale exome sequencing has identified multiple SCZ risk genes, including GRIN2A (encoding an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit) and AKAP11 (encoding a protein kinase A binding protein), which is also a risk gene for bipolar disorder (BD). However, the mechanisms by which these genetic risk factors perturb dopamine circuits and cause psychotic symptoms remain poorly understood. We asked how behavior, dorsomedial striatal dopamine (DA) dynamics and the activity of D1-/D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs) were altered in Grin2a and Akap11 mutants. In the open field, Grin2a knockout mice display hyperlocomotion and an abnormal organization of naturalistic behaviors. They also displayed heightened behavioral responses to objects and auditory stimuli. Grin2a heterozygous animals mostly showed intermediate phenotypes, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Grin2a loss. Further, Grin2a knockout mutants exhibited aberrant dopamine events, altered coupling of dopamine with locomotor features, and exaggerated stimuli-evoked dopamine responses. Notably, heterozygous animals also showed altered striatal SPN events in the open field reflecting dysregulated neural activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs. Compared to Grin2a mutants, Akap11 mutants displayed opposite phenotypes, showing reduced locomotion with a shift from high- to low-velocity movement and distinct alterations in striatal neural activity. Together, GRIN2A (SCZ risk) and AKAP11 (BD/SCZ risk) mutations induce different, often opposite, effects on striatal dopamine signaling and behavior, suggesting that these two risk genes act through distinct mechanisms.",

      "title": "Mapping the Developmental Trajectory of Functional Brain Networks in Early Infancy: Insights into Typical Maturation",
      "content": "Early infancy is a crucial period for brain development, during which fundamental functional and structural frameworks are established. Understanding the maturation of large-scale brain networks during this stage is essential for characterizing normative neurodevelopment and identifying potential deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we investigated developmental changes in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in infants using a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset comprising 137 scans from 74 low-likelihood developing infants aged 0-6 months. We applied independent component analysis to extract large-scale brain networks and utilized advanced spatial metrics, including network-averaged spatial similarity (NASS) to assess alignment with group-level patterns, network strength to quantify neural engagement based on voxel intensities, and network size to examine spatial distribution. Our findings reveal significant age-related increases in NASS across multiple networks, indicating greater consistency in functional organization over time. Additionally, most networks demonstrated increased network strength, reflecting heightened neural involvement, while network size exhibited distinct developmental trajectories, with some networks expanding and others remaining stable. These results highlight the dynamic evolution of functional brain architecture during early infancy, providing critical insights into neurodevelopmental processes.",

      "title": "Memory traces bias new learning for hippocampal generalization",
      "content": "The ability to use generalized prior experience to guide behavior in novel situations is a fundamental cognitive function. While recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus supports generalization how this is accomplished is poorly understood. Here we combined longitudinal optical imaging in head-fixed mice with computational modeling to examine generalization in hippocampal area CA1. We found that prior training accelerated behavioral adaptation to a novel environment and that this was accompanied by highly stable hippocampal representations. We identified putative memory traces from prior experience that enabled this generalization at multiple levels. At the population level, novel-context network dynamics rapidly aligned with low-dimensional neural subspaces established during prior experience. At the cellular level, spatially-informative weak ''residual'' activity reflecting generalizable information about the task structure appeared to bias which neurons form place fields (PFs) and where via behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). Finally, this was an active process as many PFs changed their reference frame in the novel environment to reflect the consistent task structure. In sum, the influence of memory traces on new PF formation may allow past experience to guide new learning such that representations are based on generalizable features, thus enabling rapid adaptive behavior in new contexts.",

      "title": "Synthesizing images to map neural networks to the human brain",
      "content": "Computational models can be used to generate hypotheses about the brain. In the visual system, this approach has revealed similarities between how natural images are represented in convolutional neural networks and in cortical regions. However, natural images generate highly correlated representations across the hierarchy of model layers, meaning that each brain region will not correspond selectively to a single layer. Because each model layer performs additional image transformations, gaining a more selective mapping between individual layers and regions could reveal how specific algorithmic stages of processing are instantiated in the brain. To enable this mapping, we developed a generative framework for image synthesis that minimizes the similarity of image representational similarity matrices across model layers, aiming to orthogonalize the distances between the patterns of unit activations evoked by the same set of images. With the patterns orthogonalized, the resulting similarity matrix for each layer provides a fingerprint of the unique computational role of that layer. To test this approach, we synthesized 16 artificial images from the Inception-V1/GoogLeNet model and scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed these images repeatedly in random order. Image-specific patterns of voxel activity were used to compute image-by-image similarity matrices across the whole brain with searchlights. Most layers could be mapped to circumscribed cortical regions, and these mappings overlapped less than the mappings obtained with natural images. Given the prevalence of existing fMRI datasets with natural images, we used the synthesis method as a benchmark to develop an alternative residual method that can achieve comparable performance for natural image datasets. These approaches could be extended to other neural network architectures and stimulus modalities for targeted mappings of model computations to the brain and behavior.",

      "title": "Sex-Specific Induction of H3K27me1 in the Prefrontal Cortex Mediates the Enduring Effects of Early Life Stress",
      "content": "Early life stress (ELS) is a strong risk factor for several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and is associated with persistent molecular alterations in corticolimbic regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we combined unbiased proteomics profiling and viral-mediated gene transfer to characterize the enduring epigenetic changes in the PFC of male and female mice previously exposed to ELS. We found that ELS induced sex-specific and age-dependent accumulation of monomethylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 (H3K27me1), with a transient increase in adolescent females, and a delayed but enduring effect in adult males. ELS-induced H3K27me1 accumulation in the PFC involved changes of SUZ12, a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which controls H3K27 methylation patterns. Indeed, expression of the catalytic domain of SUZ12, VEFS, in PFC neurons during adolescence led to sex differences in social and cognitive alterations in adulthood. Together, our results demonstrate that H3K27me1 functions as a chromatin scar in the PFC, mediating lifelong susceptibility to ELS in a sex-specific manner.",

      "title": "Dysregulated lactate metabolism synergizes with ALS genetic risk factors to accelerate motor decline",
      "content": "Neurons rely on glial lactate shuttling for metabolic support, which declines with aging and in neurodegenerative disease. Full disruption of lactate shuttling in peripheral nerves causes progressive axon degeneration, but we were interested to understand how partial disruption, a scenario more relevant to aging and disease, contributes to neurodegeneration risk. Pyruvate and lactate are interconverted by lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA and LDHB) in both lactate producing and consuming cells. We therefore began by investigating Ldhb knockout mice (loss of LDHA, the dominant LDH in liver and muscle, caused embryonic lethality), and discovered that they develop progressive neuromuscular junction atrophy and functional decline without axon degeneration. Because even Ldhb+/- heterozygosity significantly affects motor behavior, we also wondered about a potential link to congenital disease and pursued this by identifying rare loss-of-function LDHB variants among ALS patients. Next, to better understand how LDHB loss leads to motor decline, we selectively deleted it in defined cell types. SC-specific deletion caused robust motor defects, whereas motor neuron-specific deletion has little effect. Reasoning that neuronal LDHB deficiency could model age-associated decline in lactate metabolism, we asked whether it would interact with ALS genetic risk. Indeed, motor-neuron LDHB deficiency synergizes with relatively mild ALS risk variants, TDP43-Q331K and Sod1-D83G knock-in alleles, to produce early motor neuropathy, indicating that LDHB loss enhances disease risk. These findings establish lactate metabolism as a modifier of motor system vulnerability and highlight it as a therapeutic target in peripheral as well as central neurodegeneration.",

      "content": "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often emerge in adolescence. Identifying their symptom structures and neural biomarkers in youth with elevated risk is critical for early detection and developing interventions. This study investigated the central symptoms of MDD and GAD and identified the key brain regions (brain bridges) linking structural neuroanatomy to symptoms in at-risk adolescents. Methods: A total of 1,568 adolescents at high risk for MDD and 413 adolescents at high risk for GAD were identified from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Participants completed MDD and GAD symptom assessments and underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanning. We constructed 10 psychological network models incorporating symptoms and brain structural indices to identify central symptoms and brain bridges. Results: Concentration difficulties emerged as the shared core symptom, while self-hatred and irritability were the unique central symptoms for MDD and GAD, respectively. Left- and right-pallidum volumes exhibited the highest bridge centrality for MDD symptoms, whereas left-nucleus accumbens volume showed the highest bridge centrality for GAD symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the pallidum and nucleus accumbens as key brain regions linking structural anatomy to symptom networks in high-risk youth. These results provide novel insights into early neurobiological markers of MDD and GAD from a symptom-oriented perspective and may inform targeted interventions.",

      "content": "BackgroundParkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by dopaminergic neuronal loss and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Current treatments do not halt disease progression. Recent research highlights impaired cerebral lymphatic drainage in PD, suggesting a potential therapeutic target.Case presentationWe report a 56-year-old male with advanced PD who underwent deep cervical lymphovenous bypass (DCLB) surgery, a novel intervention designed to enhance lymphatic drainage by anastomosing the deep cervical lymphatic vessel to a vein. The patient had been diagnosed with PD in 2024 after experiencing progressive motor symptoms since 2019, with suboptimal response to conventional pharmacotherapy.ResultsAt three-month follow-up, significant improvements were observed: Movement Disorder Society\u2013Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale decreased by 30.4% (from 23 to 16), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale decreased by 71.4% (from 77 to 22), and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire-39 decreased by 94.2% (from 52 to 3). Both motor symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor symptoms (sleep disturbances, orthostatic dizziness) showed improvement.ConclusionDCLB was technically feasible and was followed by symptomatic improvements in this single patient. The underlying mechanism for this clinical response remains unclear and was not investigated with biomarkers in this report. While these preliminary findings are hypothesis-generating, causality cannot be inferred from an individual case. Further controlled studies incorporating neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers are needed to explore potential mechanisms.",

      "content": "Cognitive deficits affect up to half of the patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) within a decade of diagnosis, placing an increasing burden on patients, families and caregivers. Therefore, the development of strategies for their early detection is critical to enable timely intervention and management. This study aimed to classify cognitive performance in patients with PD using a binary support vector machine (SVM) model that integrates structural (high-resolution anatomical) and functional connectivity (FC; resting state) MRI data with clinical characteristics. We hypothesized that PD patients with beginning cognitive deficits can be detected through MRI in combination with machine learning. Data from 38 PD patients underwent extensive preprocessing, including large-scale FC and voxel-based analysis. Relevant features were selected using a bootstrapping approach and subsequently trained in an SVM model, with robustness ensured by 10-fold cross-validation. Although clinical parameters were considered during feature selection, the final best-performing model exclusively comprised imaging features\u2014including gray matter volume (e.g., anterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus) and inter-network functional connectivity within the frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks. This combined model achieved an accuracy of 94.7% and a ROC-AUC of 0.98. However, a model integrating clinical and only functional MRI data reached similar results with an accuracy of 94.7% and a ROC-AUC of 0.90. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that applying machine learning to multimodal MRI data\u2014integrating structural, functional, and clinical metrics\u2014could advance the early detection of cognitive impairment in PD and could therefore be used to support timely diagnosis.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello!</p> <p>I'm not the biggest fan of making GUIs and I make a lot of little projects that need some level of interaction. I tend to recreate a similar basic CLI each time which, after doing it 5+ times, felt like I was wasting time. Unfortunately projects are usually different enough that I couldn't just reuse the same menu's so I decided to try to make something that would dynamically generate the boiler-plate (I think that's how you use that term here) for me and I can just hook my programs into it and get a basic prototype going!</p> <p>To preface, I have only been coding for about a year now but I LOVE backend work (especially in regards to data) and have had a lot of fun with Python and Java. That being said, I'm still learning so there could be easier ways to implement things. I will gladly accept any and all feedback!</p> <h1>Target Audience:</h1> <p>Honestly, anyone! I started out making this just for me but decided to try to make it a lot more dynamic and formal to not only practice but just in-case someone else felt it could be useful. If you want an easy to use CLI for your project, you can generate your project, delete the generator, and go on with your day! I provided as much documentation on how everything works and should work including a walkthrough example! If you're like me and you always make small projects that need a CLI, then keep the generator and just customize it using its templates.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Most alternatives I found are libraries that help <em>build</em> CLIs (things like <code>argparse</code>, <code>Click</code>, or <code>Typer</code> ). They\u2019re great, but they don\u2019t handle the scaffolding, folder layout, documentation, or menu structure for you.</p> <p>I also wanted something that acted like a personal \u201ctoolbox,\u201d where I could easily include my own reusable helpers or plugin packs across projects.</p> <p>So instead of being a CLI framework, this is a <strong>project generator</strong>: it creates the directory structure, menu classes, navigation logic, optional modules, and usage guide for you, based on the structure you define. Out of the tools I looked at, this was the only one focused on generating the entire project skeleton, not just providing a library for writing commands. This generator doesn't need you to write any code for the menus nor for template additions. You can make your project as normal and just hook it into the noted spots (I tried to mark them with comments, print statements, and naming conventions).</p> <h1>What My Project Does:</h1> <p>This tool simply asks for:</p> <p>- A project name<br /> - Navigation style (currently lets you pick between numbers or arrows)<br /> - Formatting style (just for the title of each menu there is minimal, clean, or boxed)<br /> - Optional features to include (either the ones I include or that someone adds in themselves, the generator auto-detects it)<br /> - Menu structure (you get guided through the name of the menu, any sub-menus, the command names and if they are single or batch commands, etc.)</p> <p>At the end, it generates a complete ready-to-use CLI project with:</p> <p>- Menu classes<br /> - UI helpers<br /> - General utilities<br /> - Optional selected plugins (feature packs?)<br /> - Documentation (A usage guide)<br /> - Stubs for each command and how to hook into it (also print statements so you know things are working until then)</p> <p>All within a fairly nice folder structure. I tried really hard to make it not need any external dependencies besides what Python comes with. It is template driven so future additions or personal customizations are easy to drag and drop into either Core templates (added to every generated CLI) or Optional ones (selectable feature).</p> <p>You can find the project here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Urason-Anorsu/CLI-Toolbox-Generator\">https://github.com/Urason-Anorsu/CLI-Toolbox-Generator</a></p> <p>Also here are some images from the process, specifically the result:<br /> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/eyzbM1X\">https://imgur.com/a/eyzbM1X</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Urasonlol\"> /u/Urasonlol </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p6xu9g/i_made_a_python_cli_project_generator_to_avoid/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p6xu9g/i_made_a_python_cli_project_generator_to_avoid/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "content": "The first six months of life mark a critical window for human brain development, characterized by rapid synaptic formation, axonal growth, and network reorganization. During this period' large-scale functional networks progressively mature. Although prior infant fMRI studies have characterized temporal functional connectivity, the spatial organization and refinement of brain networks during early infancy remain underexplored. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state fMRI from 74 typically developing infants (0-6 months; 137 scans) using group independent component analysis (ICA) with group-information-guided ICA (GIG-ICA) back-reconstruction. Spatial dissimilarity between each infants spatial map and the group-level map was quantified using cosine dissimilarity and Euclidean distance. Generalized additive models were applied to model age-related trends. Both cosine and Euclidean dissimilarity metrics showed significant decreases with age, indicating a progressive convergence of individual network topographies toward the group-level architecture. These findings reveal increasing spatial coherence and refinement of large-scale brain networks during early infancy, suggesting that spatial maturation complements the well-established functional integration observed in temporal connectivity studies.",

      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.
