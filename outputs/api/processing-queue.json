      "title": "Mediodorsal Thalamic Input to Striatum Contributes to Early Action Learning",
      "content": "<p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Trans-synaptic Interaction with mGluR6 Contributes to ELFN1 Presynaptic Enrichment in Rod Photoreceptors",
      "content": "<p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>",

      "title": "Convergence and Segregation of Excitatory and Inhibitory Afferents in the Paraventricular Thalamic Nucleus",
      "content": "<p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

      "title": "Nicotine and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: unraveling the mechanisms of nicotine addiction",
      "content": "Nicotine, recognized as the principal addictive component in tobacco, is mechanistically linked to its interaction with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels composed of five transmembrane subunits, with the \u03b14\u03b22 receptor subtype being the most common in the brain, playing a crucial role in the behavioral effects of nicotine. When nicotine binds to \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR, it significantly enhances the firing rate and burst firing of dopamine neurons in the brain, thereby activating the mesolimbic dopamine system. This system promotes the formation of nicotine addiction in the early stages of addiction through rewarding sensory stimulation and associative learning. The \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR subunit has been identified as the principal subtype implicated in the pathogenesis of nicotine addiction. However, other nAChRs subtypes also play important roles in the onset and maintenance of nicotine addiction. Understanding the relationship between nicotine addiction and nAChR subtypes is crucial for fully uncovering the neurobiological mechanism behind its addictive properties and lays the foundation for developing more targeted smoking cessation strategies.",

      "title": "Studying the Effects of Robot Intervention on School Shooters in Virtual Reality",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.17948v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive, high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding their use in school environments.",

      "title": "The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Undergraduate Medical Education in Spain: Descriptive Analysis and International Perspectives",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.17938v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: AI is transforming medical practice and redefining the competencies that future healthcare professionals need to master. Despite international recommendations, the integration of AI into Medicine curricula in Spain had not been systematically evaluated until now. A cross-sectional study (July-September 2025) including Spanish universities offering the official degree in Medicine, according to the 'Register of Universities, Centers and Degrees (Registro de Universidades, Centros y T\\'itulos RUCT)'. Curricula and publicly available institutional documentation were reviewed to identify courses and competencies related to AI in the 2025-2026 academic year. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics. Of the 52 universities analyzed, ten (19.2%) offer specific AI courses, whereas 36 (69.2%) include no related content. Most of the identified courses are elective, with a credit load ranging from three to six ECTS, representing on average 1.17% of the total 360 credits of the degree. The University of Ja\\'en is the only institution offering a compulsory course with AI content. The territorial analysis reveals marked disparities: Andalusia leads with 55.5% of its universities incorporating AI training, while several communities lack any initiative in this area. The integration of AI into the medical degree in Spain is incipient, fragmented, and uneven, with a low weight in ECTS. The limited training load and predominance of elective courses restrict the preparation of future physicians to practice in a healthcare environment increasingly mediated by AI. The findings support the establishment of minimum standards and national monitoring of indicators.",

      "title": "Vibe Coding: Toward an AI-Native Paradigm for Semantic and Intent-Driven Programming",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.17842v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled developers to generate software by conversing with artificial intelligence systems rather than writing code directly. This paper introduces vibe coding, an emerging AI-native programming paradigm in which a developer specifies high-level functional intent along with qualitative descriptors of the desired \"vibe\" (tone, style, or emotional resonance). An intelligent agent then transforms those specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and responsible AI practice. Finally, we examine reported productivity gains and democratizing effects, review recent studies that highlight vulnerabilities and potential slowdowns, identify key challenges such as alignment, reproducibility, bias, explainability, maintainability, and security, and outline future directions and open research questions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.18625v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present an experiment exploring how the controller's virtual representation impacts target acquisition performance across MR and VR contexts. Participants performed selection tasks comparing four visual configurations: a virtual controller, a virtual hand, both the controller and the hand, and neither representation. We found performance comparable between VR and MR, and switching between them did not impact the user's ability to perform basic tasks. Controller representations mimicking reality enhanced performance across both modes. However, users perceived performance differently in MR, indicating the need for unique MR design considerations, particularly regarding spatial awareness.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.18385v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Game-based learning shows real promise for engaging students in well-funded schools, but what about everyone else? We propose a practical framework for implementing Minecraft Education Edition in Bangladesh's 130,000 schools where 55 percent lack reliable internet, rural areas experience 12-16 hour daily power availability, only 8 percent of rural schools have computer access, and student-teacher ratios reach 52:1. Our approach tackles these constraints head-on with three deployment tiers: cloud-based multiplayer for urban schools with stable infrastructure (15 percent), local area network solutions with solar power for semi-urban contexts (30 percent), and offline turn-based modes using refurbished hardware for rural settings (55 percent). We provide eight pre-built curriculum-aligned worlds with complete Bangla localization covering topics from Lalbagh Fort reconstruction to monsoon flood simulation. The interface accommodates first-time users through progressive complexity, culturally familiar metaphors using local farming and architecture, and accessibility features including keyboard-only controls and 200 percent text scaling. Teacher training spans 48 hours across digital literacy, pedagogical integration, and content creation. We detail evaluation protocols with specific benchmarks: 15 percent learning gains, 70 percent transfer task mastery, System Usability Scale scores above 70, and sub-two-dollar cost per student-hour. This framework has not been empirically validated; it synthesizes game-based learning theory, HCI principles, and contextual analysis to provide implementable specifications for pilot testing in resource-constrained settings.",
