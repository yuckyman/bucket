      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Identifying Key Regulators in Odorant Receptor Trafficking",
      "content": "<p>Odor detection in mammals is primarily mediated by odorant receptors (ORs), the largest family of G-protein-coupled receptors, expressed in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs; Buck and Axel, 1991). However, most ORs exhibit little or no cell surface expression in nonolfactory cell types (Lu et al., 2003; Hague et al., 2004). While the accessory protein RTP1 and RTP2 enhance the expression of certain ORs, we hypothesized that additional proteins coregulated with RTP1 and RTP2 during OSN maturation may further enhance OR cell surface expression (Saito et al., 2004; Zhuang and Matsunami, 2007). To test this, we developed a computational pipeline based on publicly available single-cell transcriptomic data to create an interactive tool for exploring gene expression during OSN maturation. Using this tool, we identified genes coregulated with Rtp1 during olfactory development. Three genes&mdash;Gfy, Clgn, and Syt1&mdash;exhibited transcriptional profiles similar to Rtp1. When coexpressed with an OR, these genes, in combination with Rtp1, promoted cell-surface expression of the tested ORs. Importantly, we demonstrated a physical interaction between Syt1 and an OR (Or1ad1) via co-immunoprecipitation, suggesting a novel role for Syt1 in OR trafficking or stabilization. We also observed localization of Syt1 protein in OSN cilia in both male and female mice. Together, these findings provide new insights into OSN development and the molecular mechanisms underlying OR biogenesis, paving the way for further research into the functional regulation of the olfactory systems.</p>",

      "title": "Differential and Temporally Dynamic Involvement of Primate Amygdala Nuclei in Face Reality and Reward Information Processing",
      "content": "<p>Decision-making is influenced by both expected rewards and social factors, such as who offers the outcomes. Therefore, although a reward might originally be independent of social factors, the two elements are closely related. However, whether and how they are processed separately or conjointly remains unclear. Here, we show that neurons in distinct subnuclei of the amygdala encode expected reward and face reality, a vital aspect of face perception. Although these encoding processes are distinct, they rely on partially shared neuronal circuits with characteristic temporal dynamics. Two male macaque monkeys made saccades under different social and reward contexts by viewing facial images with independent attributes: reality (a real monkey or a cartoon face) and associated reward (large or small). The stimulus image was presented twice per trial: during initial stimulus encoding (S1) and before saccades were made (S2). A longer gaze duration for the eye region of the monkeys compared with cartoons indicated more robust social engagement with realistic faces. During S1, a similar number of lateral nucleus neurons encoded either reality only, with a monkey-image preference; reward only, with a large-reward preference; or both. Conversely, neurons in the basal and central nuclei primarily encoded reward, preferring large- versus small-reward&ndash;associated face images. Reward-dependent modulation continued after S1 but was more conspicuous during S1 in the basal nucleus and during both S1 and S2 in the central nucleus. This anatomically and temporally specific encoding in the amygdala may underlie the computation and integration of social and reward information.</p>",

      "title": "Restoration of sFRP3 Preserves the Neural Stem Cell Pool and Spatial Discrimination Ability in a Mouse Model of Alzheimers Disease",
      "content": "<p>Individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have an increased incidence of seizures, which worsen cognitive decline. Using a transgenic mouse model of AD neuropathology that exhibits spontaneous seizures, we previously found that seizure activity stimulates and accelerates depletion of the hippocampal neural stem cell (NSC) pool, which was associated with deficits in neurogenesis-dependent spatial discrimination. However, the precise molecular mechanisms that drive seizure-induced activation and depletion of NSCs are unclear. Here, using mice of both sexes, we performed RNA-sequencing on the hippocampal dentate gyrus and identified differentially expressed regulators of neurogenesis in the Wnt signaling pathway that regulates many aspects of cell proliferation. We found that the expression of sFRP3, a Wnt signaling inhibitor, is altered in a seizure-dependent manner and might be regulated by FosB, a seizure-induced transcription factor. Increasing sFRP3 expression prevented NSC depletion and improved spatial discrimination, suggesting that the loss of sFRP3 might mediate seizure-driven impairment in cognition in AD model mice and perhaps also in AD.</p>",
