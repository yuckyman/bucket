      "title": "Four new Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse models with clinically relevant exon deletions in the human DMD gene",
      "content": "Mutation specific therapeutic approaches, like exon skipping or gene-editing, hold promise for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Translatability of preclinical studies investigating these approaches could greatly be improved through the use of humanized mouse models, as these allow preclinical testing of human specific sequences. We developed four novel humanized DMD mouse models with either a deletion of exon 44, 45, 51 or 53 in the human DMD gene, in a mouse dystrophin negative background (mdx mouse; exon 23 nonsense mutation). Our optimized prescreening pipeline allowed us to do so very efficiently with the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We confirmed either complete lack of dystrophin, or expression of trace levels, which led to development of muscle pathology consisting of muscle fiber de-, and regeneration, inflammation and fibrosis in young adult mice. Intramuscular treatment with vivo-morpholinos targeting a flanking exon induced exon skipping in the DMD strains, which restored the disrupted open reading frame and subsequently dystrophin expression. This validates these models as valuable tools for preclinical studies investigating human sequence specific therapeutic approaches for DMD.",

      "title": "Cognitive Performance and Brain-Predicted Age Difference in Bipolar Disorder",
      "content": "Neuroimaging-derived brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) is a promising marker of advanced brain aging, but its link to cognitive function in bipolar disorder (BD) is not well understood, especially when comparing across publicly available algorithms trained on diverse, large sample datasets and to algorithms trained on local cohorts with rich multimodal imaging data. Our study compares algorithms used to estimate brain-PAD in terms of their clinical relevance to cognition in BD. We included 44 euthymic BD I individuals and 73 HCs who completed the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, and we selected nine scores from this battery for further analyses. Raw scores were log-transformed, scaled, and subjected to PCA; PC1 indexed overall executive function. Four brain-PAD algorithms (PHOTON, BrainageR, DenseNet, Multimodal) were applied to T1-weighted MRI data; the multimodal algorithm also included Diffussion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL), functional Magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and resting state Magnetic resonance imaging (rsMRI) data. For each algorithm, we regressed brain-PAD on age, sex, and their interaction to obtain residuals, then used those residualized brain-PADs (which we refer to subsequently as brain-PADs throughout the text) to predict PC1. We then directly assessed if there were group differences in the relationship of brain-PAD to cognitive function by including an interaction term between group x brain-PAD. We found no significant group x brain-PAD interaction across all four algorithms. Given that, we then combined BD and HC and explored whether brain-PAD was a meaningful predictor of cognitive performance. Multimodal brain-PAD emerged as a strong negative predictor of cognitive performance (Beta Estimate = -0.084, SE = 0.024, t = -3.50, p < 0.001), indicating that those with older-appearing brains, as indexed by the brain-PAD, scored lower on PC1. BrainageR brain-PAD also significantly predicted PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.031, SE = 0.0116, t = -2.71, p < 0.01), and DenseNet brain-PAD showed a modest effect (Beta Estimate = -0.0355, SE = 0.0177, t = -2.00, p < 0.05). PHOTON brain-PAD demonstrated a negative trend with PC1 (Beta Estimate = -0.024, SE = 0.0127, t = -1.92, p = 0.06). Residualized brain-PAD, after accounting for age and sex, was inversely associated with a composite metric of executive functioning, particularly for an algorithm integrating a range of imaging modalities. Our findings demonstrate how brain aging patterns captured by a neuroimaging-based, ML-derived composite metric could be associated with cognitive performance across algorithms trained on a variety of data granularity and sample sizes.",

      "title": "Deep White-Matter Pathways Mediate the Link Between Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Status and Cognitive Performance in Adolescence",
      "content": "Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is a polyunsaturated fatty acid enriched in neuronal membranes and myelin and associated with cognitive performance. However, nutritional interventions show inconsistent cognitive effects, partly due to limited knowledge of the neural pathways linking DHA status to human cognition during sensitive periods of white-matter maturation, such as adolescence. We addressed this gap by studying 99 adolescents drawn from both extremes of performance on a national scholastic examination. Participants completed assessments of scholastic achievement (SA) and intellectual ability (IA), provided erythrocyte DHA samples, and underwent multimodal MRI, including diffusion, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted imaging. Independent component analysis and Bayesian multivariate LASSO models identified brain components jointly associated with DHA and cognition. Across four MRI modalities, a single deep white-matter component consistently emerged as the strongest shared pathway linking DHA with cognition. Tract-resolved analyses highlighted predominant contributions from the fornix and thalamus - temporal fasciculus, with additional subcortical and cortical involvement. In joint models, these components predicted SA and IA after accounting for DHA and other fatty acids, consistent with an indirect, mediation-like pathway. These findings move beyond DHA - behavior correlations by identifying specific neuroanatomical pathways through which a modifiable dietary factor relates to adolescent learning and intellectual performance, offering mechanistic insight relevant to neuroscience, nutrition, and education.",

This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Hippocampal sequences traverse a memory space",
      "content": "Highly reliable sequential dynamics organize neural activity in the hippocampus and progress with changes in physical, sensory, or cognitive variables, typified by place cells during active exploration. But sensory and behavioral variables are often confounded, and so it remains intensely debated whether hippocampal sequences are driven by sensory content directly or rather reflect the alignment of internally generated dynamics to external perception. Here we used mouse virtual reality to characterize hippocampal dynamics in environments of systematically different sensory complexity, and to test the robustness of neural sequences to manipulations of exact sensory content. The structure of neural sequences was perturbed by changes in both moment-to-moment sensation and ongoing behavior, in a pattern that was best explained by the different memory strategies employed by the animal in each context. Neural subsequences could be flexibly interrupted, inserted, and resumed wherever a memory of prior experience was violated, indicating that the propagation of hippocampal dynamics was not rigidly fixed by internal networks and initial conditions. Rather, we argue that hippocampal sequences explore an abstract memory space of selectively remembered experiences, which flexibly encompasses both sensory and internal factors in a context-dependent manner.",

      "content": "Neural circuits must integrate metabolic information to maintain stable activity and appropriate behavioral responses. While metabolic regulation of excitatory synapses has been well studied, far less is known about how inhibitory synapses respond to changes in energy state. In this study, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a dynamic sensor of cellular nutrient flux, localizes to postsynaptic sites of the inhibitory synapses where it modulates synapse morphology and receptor composition. OGT over-expression reduced the size and intensity of vGAT and gephyrin puncta, whereas conditional OGT deletion produced a converse enlargement and redistribution of inhibitory scaffolds and vesicular proteins. Furthermore, OGT deletion accelerated inhibitory postsynaptic current decay kinetics and induced subunit-specific shifts in GABAA receptor surface expression: {beta}3 subunits decreased, whereas {gamma}2 subunit total and surface levels increased. Together, these findings identify OGT as a metabolic regulator that modulates inhibitory synapse structure and signaling, providing a mechanistic link between energy state and GABAergic circuit function in health and disease.",

      "title": "Most early-born subplate neurons persist as Layer 6b neurons in the adult mouse neocortex",
      "content": "Subplate neurons (SpNs) are among the earliest-born neurons in the mammalian neocortex and play key roles in radial migration and transient circuit formation. It has long been assumed that most SpNs undergo extensive postnatal cell death, leaving only a small remnant population that contributes to layer 6b (L6b) in adulthood. However, the extent to which SpNs actually persist as L6b neurons has remained unresolved, partly because previous studies lacked quantitative, whole-cortex analyses that account for postnatal cortical expansion. Here, we performed a comprehensive birthdating analysis using multiple EdU injections spanning the entire neurogenic window of SpNs in mice, combined with whole-neocortex 3D tissue clearing to measure subplate and L6b volumes. This approach allowed us to directly estimate the total number and distribution of SpN-derived neurons in adulthood. We found that most early-born SpNs persist as L6b neurons, and that the apparent postnatal reduction in SpN density reflects tangential cortical expansion rather than neuronal loss. Moreover, surviving SpNs comprise diverse neuronal subtypes reminiscent of those present at early postnatal stages. Together, these findings demonstrate that, in rodents, the majority of adult L6b neurons originate from SpNs, revising the long-held view that the subplate is a largely transient neuronal population.",

      "title": "Neural Sensitivity to Word Frequency Modulated by Morphological Structure: Univariate and Multivariate fMRI Evidence from Korean",
      "content": "A fundamental question in psycholinguistics concerns whether morphological decomposition is obligatory during visual word recognition or whether whole-word access can occur under conditions of high frequency and familiarity. The present study aimed to examine how morphological complexity and lexical frequency jointly influence neural representations during visual word recognition. We addressed this question using rapid event-related fMRI with both univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-five native Korean speakers performed lexical decisions on simple and inflected nouns that varied parametrically in surface frequency (token frequency of the full word form) and base frequency (cumulative stem frequency). Korean's transparent agglutinative morphology enabled a principled dissociation of these frequency measures. MVPA failed to decode morphological condition from activation patterns in any region, suggesting that simple and inflected forms are not represented as discrete neural categories. Crucially, RSA demonstrated robust encoding of surface frequency-but not base frequency-in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), with significantly stronger correlations for inflected than simple nouns. Univariate analyses confirmed this pattern: surface frequency interacted with morphological condition in inferior parietal lobule (IPL), such that higher surface frequency increased activation selectively for inflected forms, while base frequency showed no reliable effects. These results challenge obligatory decomposition and support a distributional framework in which lexical statistics guide the processing of morphologically complex words. Taken together, our findings suggest that morphological complexity modulates neural sensitivity to whole-word rather than stem-level statistics, underscoring how structural and statistical factors interact to support morphological processing.",
