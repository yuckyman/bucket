      "content": "While the Jendrassik maneuver (JM) is commonly used in neurology to enhance monosynaptic reflexes such as the knee-jerk reflex, its interaction with cognitive processes like motor imagery (MI) remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of JM, MI, and their combination on the left flexor carpi radialis (FCR) H-reflex and cortical electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Twenty healthy participants completed four tasks: resting, MI (imagining squeezing a tennis ball with the left hand), JM (squeezing a tennis ball with the right hand), and JM combined with MI (JM&amp;MI). The FCR H-reflex was elicited with median nerve stimulation, and EEG changes were analyzed through event-related potentials and modulations of the mu rhythm. Surprisingly, JM performed with the right hand did not affect the contralateral H-reflex. MI of the left hand decreased the H-reflex in the right FCR. JM and MI significantly modulated cortical activity. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu-rhythm occurred during both JM and MI, and it was contralateral to the physical contraction or imagery. Bilateral ERD was observed during JM&amp;MI. Cortical responses to nerve stimulation (P100, N100 and P300 components) varied by task, and during JM the P100 and P300 components correlated with strength of mu-rhythm ERD.",

      "title": "The molecular mechanism of uptake and cell-to-cell transmission of arginine-containing dipeptide repeat proteins.",
      "content": "Micro-satellite repeat expansion of the 5' GGGGCC 3' sequence in the C9orf72 gene is the most common monogenic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) translated from the mutant allele can be detected in postmortem brains of afflicted individuals. The arginine containing peptides, poly-PR and poly-GR, are particularly noxious to cells. Both have been shown to undergo cell-cell transmission, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We found rapid internalization and nucleolar localization of bath-applied hemagglutinin (HA) tagged poly-PR with twenty repeats (HA-PR20) in cell lines and neurons. Small molecule and RNAi approaches implicated a temperature-dependent, fluid phase endocytosis mechanism in HA-PR20 uptake. We sought to identify DPR-related cell surface uptake factors using a high-resolution proximity labeling technique developed in the MacMillan group, termed Map. DPR-iridium conjugates identified candidate cell-surface proteins which were interrogated in an RNAi screen. Focusing on our strongest candidate, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), we showed that cellular uptake of HA-PR20 is blocked by inhibition of glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis (using drugs or RNAi) and knockdown or ablation of CSPG4 (using RNAi or CRISPR editing). Reduction of CSPG4 protected PR20-induced neuronal toxicity. We used a dual reporter system to interrogate in vitro neuron-to-neuron transmission of PR50 and found that PR50 synthesized by one neuron readily spread to neighboring neurons. Transmission was significantly reduced when CSPG4 was knocked down. These results suggest CSPG4 is an important factor in poly-PR internalization and transmission and therefore may be a therapeutic target to slow DPR transmission and disease progression.",

      "title": "The fat-body secreted neuropeptide CCHa2 signals insulin-producing cells in the brain to promote sleep",
      "content": "Sleep is a fundamental behavior regulated by diverse environmental and physiological cues. While the central mechanisms underlying sleep regulation have been investigated in detail, far less is known about how nutrient signals from the periphery are communicated to the brain to modulate sleep. Here, we perform a targeted RNAi screen of genes enriched in the fat body and regulated by feeding state to identify genes that function in the fat body to regulate sleep in Drosophila. This analysis found that body-specific knockdown of CCHa2 significantly reduced sleep duration and sleep depth in fed flies, phenocopying sleep in starved flies. CCHa2-deficient flies exhibited reduced glycogen stores and diminished feeding drive. Analysis of single-cell transcriptomic atlases confirms that the CCHa2 receptor (CCHa2-R) is selectively expressed in Insulin Producing Cells (IPCs) of the fly brain. We find that knockdown of CCHa2-R in IPCs recapitulates the sleep loss phenotype of CCHa2 mutants, supporting a role in adipose-brain signaling. Further screening of genes identified in single cell atlases as being enriched in IPCs led to the identification of numerous genes that function in IPCs to regulate sleep including modulators of wnt and insulin signaling. Together, these findings identify a fat body-IPC axis that is a critical modulator of sleep duration and intensity.",

      "title": "Evidence for separate processes underlying movement and decision vigor in a reward-oriented task",
      "content": "The vigor of movement and decision-making is fundamental to many reward-oriented behaviors. While some theories propose that movement and decision are jointly invigorated to maximize a global utility (e.g., mixing reward, effort, and time), alternative perspectives suggest that the brain can separately invigorate them when advantageous. We tested these competing hypotheses using a foraging-like task that allowed experimentally assessing the vigor of movement (reaching to reward location) and that of decision-making (harvesting reward). By using a block-wise design, we measured the effects of independent manipulations of time and effort on reach and harvest durations. Decoupled effects were found on reach and harvest durations, with no inter-individual consistency between them. A model that separately optimized movement and decision vigor predicted these results better than a global utility model. These findings support the separate control hypothesis, indicating that distinct time-cost signals (sensitive to recent temporal history) may invigorate movement and decision. We conclude that movement and decision vigor is only indirectly linked, with any apparent co-regulation arising when both are governed by a shared temporal signal reflecting a common cost of time.",

      "title": "Encoding without generation in the medial prefrontal cortex during cautious goal-directed actions",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior requires flexibly initiating or withholding actions in response to threat-predictive cues, often balancing urgency with cautious delay. Although dorsomedial, including prelimbic, prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been widely implicated in this control, the specific role of GABAergic neurons remains unclear. We combined fiber photometry and single-cell calcium imaging in mice performing cued tasks of increasing complexity to examine how PFC GABAergic neurons encode task variables, including relative to a comparison region, visual cortex (VI). Mixed-effects modeling showed that movement and baseline activity were dominant predictors of neural activity in both regions, but PFC neurons additionally encoded punished outcomes broadly and correct action generation or deferment only under challenging contexts. Single-cell analyses revealed subsets selectively modulated at cue onset or action generation. Yet broad optogenetic inhibition of PFC or VI produced similarly minimal effects on learning or performance across tasks, indicating that PFC encoding does not reflect behavioral control.",

      "title": "Hippocampal network activity changes during early epileptogenesis predict subsequent epilepsy",
      "content": "The circuit mechanisms underlying focal epileptogenesis are, despite of decades of epilepsy research, still incompletely understood. In this study, we aimed to characterize the changes in hippocampal network activity induced by a potentially epileptogenic insult. In rats, long-lasting electrical perforant pathway stimulation leads in a high percentage of animals to the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, a subset of animals remains resilient against the stimulation. We monitored alterations of neuronal activity by chronically recording the local field potential (LFP) from the hippocampal dentate gyrus before, during and after the potentially epileptogenic insult. Intriguingly, epilepsy animals identified by subsequent spontaneous epileptic seizures were characterized by a transient increase in the aperiodic exponent suggesting a shift towards a reduced local excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio during the first days after the perforant path stimulation. Furthermore, these animals developed a strong impairment of theta oscillation prevalence and regularity during early epileptogenesis. In contrast, resilient non-epilepsy animals without spontaneous seizures neither showed this modulation in E/I ratio nor a corruption of hippocampal theta activity. In fact, the increase in the aperiodic exponent on the first day after completion of the electrical stimulation paradigm could predict epileptogenesis with very high fidelity (AUC 0.92) and correlated significantly with later seizure rate. This finding opens the opportunity to dissect mechanisms of epileptogenesis and to test the effectiveness of anti-epileptogenesis treatment in very early disease stages by allowing identification of individuals at high risk. Furthermore, it might offer a potential explanation for the frequently observed failure of anti-epileptogenesis drugs boosting GABAergic inhibition.",

      "title": "A developmentally inspired computational model of face recognition that learns continuously through generative memory replay",
      "content": "Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have emerged as powerful models for human face recognition, capturing several hallmark behavioral phenomena such as the face inversion effect and the other-race effect. Yet, key differences remain between how DCNNs and humans, particularly infants, learn to recognize faces. In this study, we present a developmentally-inspired model that addresses three critical gaps between humans and standard DCNNs: (1) DCNNs are trained via one-time batch learning, whereas infants encounter faces gradually over time; (2) DCNNs are trained on thousands of face images with high variability of static images for each identity, while infants are initially exposed to a small number of identities, often limited to close caregivers, through a continuous, dynamic stream of visual input with lower within-identity variability; (3) The goal of DCNNs is to recognize untrained (unfamiliar) faces, while the goal of human face system is to recognize familiar faces. To better approximate developmental face learning, we introduce a model comprising three interacting modules: an Embedder - a DCNN trained to encode face identity continually on up to 10 identities, based on images taken from videos of a TV series; an Autoencoder used for generative memory-replay, to construct images of missing identities in each training phase; and a Memory module - stores identity-specific latent codes. Results show that this model achieves recognition performance comparable to batch-trained DCNNs. We propose this new model as a framework for studying the developmental and mature mechanisms of human face recognition.",
