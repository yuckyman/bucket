      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

I just want to do some task/project and checkout.\n- Fully remote will be ideal.\n- Salary can be on the low end.\n- I feel the world currently is too hyper-capitalistic and I don't think I fit in well. On top of that my country has a billion+ people and everything seems like battle for scraps.<p>Unless I hit home with some indie hacking/side project, I don't think this will be possible. I believe there must some niche apps/plugin/extension/ssydev roles for some crm/cms etc that might fit the bill.<p>Few point to note:\n- No, I'm not that depressed. I'm just deeply unhappy with the current state of things.\n- No, I'm not giving up on life.\n- It may look like I'm not be good fit for tech/programming jobs. But I still like tech and solving tech problems. I just dont want my life to revolve around it.\n- It could be that im not challenged well in my job.

      "title": "TSLNet: a hierarchical multi-head attention-enabled two-stream LSTM network for accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition",
      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

The only real options are joining Discord, or watching markdown commits on GitHub, neither of which is ideal for everyone.</p>\n<p>To help make things easier, the following two changelog sites have been built.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://changes.fmhy.bid/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://changes.fmhy.bid/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers changes that occur in both the #Recently-Added and #Monthly-Update channels in our Discord.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers links that have been added, updated, or removed by watching GitHub for changes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note that we will also continue to make the monthly posts same as always, and you can still follow updates by joining our <a href=\"https://redd.it/17f8msf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a>, or watching the <a href=\"https://github.com/fmhy/edit/commits/main/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commits Page</a> on GitHub yourself.</p>\n<p>We hope you guys like them, if you have any suggestions or questions feel free to let us know.</p>",
