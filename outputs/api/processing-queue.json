      "title": "The neurobiology of play: a narrative review of evidence from mice and humans for advancing neurorehabilitation",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis narrative conceptual review explores the neurobiological underpinnings of play behaviour across species, with an emphasis on how play affects brain development, social functioning, and cognitive outcomes from early life through aging.MethodsWe synthesize current neuroscientific literature from animal and human studies, focusing on translational evidence involving specific brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, amygdala, striatum), neurochemical systems (e.g., dopamine, opioids), and behavioral domains (e.g., executive function, emotional regulation, and social cognition). Studies are categorized by developmental stage and functional impact.ResultsEvidence from rodent models demonstrates the activation of distinct neural circuits during structured and spontaneous play (e.g., hide-and-seek, rough-and-tumble), with sex-specific differences in cortical and subcortical engagement. In humans, play emerges in infancy and supports neural plasticity, language development, and executive functioning. Later in life, playfulness correlates with cognitive resilience and may act as a protective factor against neurodegeneration. The review also highlights play-based rehabilitation approaches (e.g., sensory-motor therapy, LEGO\u00ae-based interventions, sports) with demonstrated neurological and psychosocial benefits.ConclusionPlay is a multidimensional, evolutionarily conserved behaviour that engages neurobiological systems critical to development and health. Although promising evidence supports play-based interventions, further research is needed to clarify mechanisms, optimize therapeutic use, and bridge species-specific findings in translational neuroscience.",

      "content": "Objective. To determine whether the perceptual intensity of speech signals\u2014manipulated via loudness and dynamically adjusted through a brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) paradigm\u2014modulates neural speech tracking and short-term memory. Approach. We implemented an EEG brain state-dependent design in which real-time variations in alpha power were used to modulate the loudness of pre-recorded digits during a task modelled on the digit span test. Speech tracking was quantified using lagged Gaussian copula mutual information (2\u201310 Hz), and behavioural performance was assessed through recall accuracy. Main results. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher loudness would enhance speech tracking and memory via bottom\u2013up attention, digit recall accuracy was stable across loudness conditions. Speech tracking revealed an unexpected pattern: louder stimuli presented during high alpha power (low attention) elicited reduced tracking magnitudes and shorter peak latencies, whereas quieter stimuli delivered during low alpha power (high attention) produced stronger and more temporally extended tracking responses. Significance. These findings may suggest that internal attentional state, rather than external stimulus salience, plays a dominant role in shaping speech encoding. The study provides proof-of-concept evidence for BSDS in auditory paradigms, showing the importance of attentional fluctuations and stimulus loudness in determining the strength and timing of neural speech tracking, with implications for the design of adaptive speech-enhancement strategies.",

      "title": "Characterization of vagus nerve active fibers during seizure in rats",
      "content": "Objective. Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million individuals worldwide. Vagus nerve activity is known to be modulated by seizures; however, the types of fibers that are activated during seizures remain unknown. This work compares the electrical activity of the vagus nerve before, during, and after seizures in epileptic rats. Approach. Six rats experiencing pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy seizures and two rats under saline solution were investigated. Action potentials (AP) identified by template matching were sorted according to the fiber type they are deemed to originate from. AP templates were based on a 3D COMSOL simplified model of the vagus nerve. Model templates were established for fibers of different diameters based on histology. Correspondences are thus established based on specific fiber diameters. Main results. During seizures, an increase in the percentage of occurrence of APs was observed for 2 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm fibers, while a decrease was observed for 4 \u00b5m, 5\u20136 \u00b5m, and 7\u201311 \u00b5m fibers. This was not observed in the rat group under saline solution. The increase in smaller diameter sizes is believed to be linked to an increase in autonomic activity. Significance. These findings contribute to a better understanding of vagus nerve dynamics during epileptic seizures and highlight the potential of vagus nerve activity as a physiological marker for seizure detection and monitoring. This would be of particular interest in vagus nerve stimulation to control any closed-loop form of therapy. This work provides a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in epilepsy management.",

      "title": "Intrinsic and extrinsic feedback generate similar propulsion but distinct biomechanical strategies during split-belt walking",
      "content": "BackgroundForward propulsion during walking is generated by different joints and biomechanical mechanisms depending on environmental and task demands. Although propulsion can be modulated by feedback, it is unclear whether extrinsic and intrinsic feedback generate similar propulsion or promote different joint-level strategies during split-belt walking. The purpose of this study was to investigate strategies used by non-impaired individuals to generate greater propulsion using different feedback to reach targeted levels of propulsion force during split-belt walking.MethodsFifteen young adults walked on a split-belt treadmill with the dominant leg on the fast belt at their comfortable walking speed and the non-dominant leg on the slow belt at half speed. They performed trials with extrinsic via visual feedback of propulsive force (targeting 5 and 10% body weight) and with intrinsic feedback via a backward resistive force at the center of mass (5 and 10% body weight). Primary outcome was propulsion accuracy, measured as average propulsion error relative to target levels. Secondary analyses examined explanatory biomechanical variables related to propulsion generation. Outcomes were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.ResultsParticipants achieved similar target propulsion across feedback types (p =\u202f0.66). However, biomechanical strategies differed. Visual feedback increased trailing limb angle (TLA) at 5% (p =\u202f0.0011) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001) and increased ankle moment at 5% (p =\u202f0.0005) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001). In contrast, backward resistive force increased (BRF) hip moment at 5% (p =\u202f0.0018) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001), and hip power at both 5 and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001). Ankle power did not differ between feedback types at 5% (p =\u202f0.0754) but was greater under BRF at 10% (p <\u202f0.0001).ConclusionWhile both feedback types generate similar propulsion to achieve different target levels during split-belt treadmill walking, they engaged distinct biomechanical strategies. Our results indicate that participants increased TLA and ankle moment under visual feedback. However, they increased hip moment and hip power under BRF, with ankle power adjustments depending on the target level. The findings highlight motor abundance in gait and suggest tailoring rehabilitation strategies in populations with impaired propulsion.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",
