      "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
      "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

      "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
      "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

      "title": "Supporting autistic adults with complex communication needs in making their voices heard: examining an adaptation of the Autism Voices framework",
      "content": "IntroductionAutistic adults with speech, language and/or cognitive challenges are often excluded from research, particularly from studies examining first-person perspectives, as these generally require that participants have strong speech, language, and cognitive skills. The current pilot study extends previous work and examines whether the Autism Voices framework can be adapted for use with a pre-existing interview the Camberwell Assessment of Need for Adults with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities-Research version (CANDID-R).MethodsEleven young autistic adults with complex communication needs completed the CANDID-R interview using visual supports. These visual supports were provided to assist participants\u2019 comprehension of interview questions and to support them in answering the interview questions. Participants\u2019 caregivers also completed the interview and their answers to specific validation questions were compared to those of their adult children. Additionally, behavioral observations were also completed.ResultsThe findings from this pilot study indicate that our adaptation of the Autism Voices framework was, at least partially successful in supporting participants in answering the interview questions. Additionally, behavioral observations indicate that the visual supports helped participants remain engaged throughout the interview. However, results also indicate that further adaptations, which we discuss, will be required.ConclusionAutistic people with complex communication needs must be included in research about the lived experiences of autistic people. Building on previous work, we show that, with dedication and imagination, equitable and inclusive research is possible.",
