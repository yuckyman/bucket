      "title": "Developmental Trajectories of Addition and Subtraction in Early School-aged Children",
      "content": "Mastering basic arithmetic lays the foundation for lifelong mathematical achievement, yet how the neural mechanisms underlying addition and subtraction calculations develop during childhood remain unclear. This study investigated the developmental trajectories of addition and subtraction calculations in school-aged children, and explored how arithmetic-specific neural responses in the right parieto-occipital region are related to age-related improvements in behavioral performance. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 115 typically developing children divided into three age groups (7-8-, 9-10-, and 11-12-year-olds) during an arithmetic task involving addition and subtraction calculations. We analyzed the P300 component from the original waveforms and the {triangleup}P300 component from the difference waveforms, which were generated by subtracting the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by the first operand from those elicited by the second operand to isolate arithmetic-specific neural processes. The results revealed that, in both calculations, older children showed better behavioral performance (faster reaction time and larger PI) and greater right parieto-occipital {triangleup}P300 amplitudes, with a key developmental stage at 11-12 years. Furthermore, all groups of children exhibited greater right parieto-occipital P300 and {triangleup}P300 amplitudes in subtraction, whereas the smaller right parieto-occipital {triangleup}P300 amplitudes in addition significantly mediated the relationship between age and PI. These findings reveal distinct patterns for addition and subtraction calculations over development, highlighting the right parieto-occipital {triangleup}P300 amplitude as a neural marker of arithmetic performance, particularly for addition calculation.",

      "content": "There is considerable variability across individuals in the behavioral expression of goal-directed and habitual control, and yet little is known about the underlying functional neuroanatomical basis of such differences. Here, we aimed to determine whether distinct patterns of brain activity during initial learning of instrumental actions can indicate whether an individual subsequently utilizes a goal-directed or habitual behavioral strategy. We applied multivariate pattern analyses to a large fMRI dataset composed of 108 participants performing an instrumental action-learning task. Region-of-interest (ROI) and whole-brain searchlight analyses with cross-validation indicate that distributed activation patterns in the left posterior putamen during training distinguish goal-directed from habitual participants, ascertained via subsequent administration of an outcome devaluation test. This finding was further replicated and generalized to two fully held-out samples: an additional cohort of healthy participants (n = 38) and a separate group of psychiatric patients with variable diagnoses (n = 55). These findings reveal that it is possible to predict an individual's overall behavioral strategy from circumscribed activity in the human brain, while specifically implicating the posterior putamen in the implementation of distinct behavioral control strategies.",

      "title": "Susceptibility to Task-irrelevant Auditory Distractors in Relation to Visual Working Memory in Children With and Without ADHD",
      "content": "Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children and is often associated with increased distractibility. Previous research has reported that susceptibility to task-irrelevant visual distractions is associated with visual working memory (WM) capacity. However, how neural responses to task-irrelevant auditory distractors are related to visual WM capacity in children with and without ADHD remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 72 children with ADHD and 88 typically developing (TD) children across two experiments, during which they performed visual tasks of varying difficulty while task-irrelevant auditory distractors were presented. The mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude was measured as a neural index of susceptibility to auditory distractors, and the K score was assessed as a behavioral indicator of visual WM capacity. Results: TD children showed opposite patterns across the two experiments: under low audiovisual competition, those with higher visual working memory capacity were more susceptible to task-irrelevant sounds, whereas under high competition, children with lower capacity showed greater susceptibility to distraction. In contrast, children with ADHD showed a stable association, with lower visual WM capacity consistently predicting higher susceptibility to task-irrelevant auditory distractors regardless of competition level. Conclusions: These findings provide novel evidence that susceptibility to task-irrelevant auditory distraction is closely related to visual WM capacity in both children with and without ADHD, but the patterns of this relationship differ between typical and atypical neurodevelopment and are modulated by audiovisual competition.",

      "title": "Environmental dynamics shape human learning: change points versus random walks",
      "content": "Adaptive learning requires interpreting prediction errors in light of environmental dynamics. However, environments may not only differ in terms of when changes occur, but also how they occur: some nonstationary processes in nature exhibit slow drifts over time, while others show more abrupt changes. This raises the question as to whether humans can adapt their learning to reflect the generative structure of their environment. Here, we compared how humans learn in two canonical nonstationary environments: abrupt change points versus gradual random walks. Using a predictive inference task and a unified Bayesian framework, we show across two behavioral experiments that humans adapt their learning normatively between these two environments. Notably, identical prediction errors were interpreted differently across them. Large prediction errors triggered sharp increases in learning rate under change-point but not random-walk dynamics, where small and large errors were more equally weighted. This matched the predictions of a normative Bayesian model, which itself adopted the appropriate generative model for each environment. In addition, we found that humans could dissociate two latent variables that needed to be jointly inferred: the mean and variance (or stochasticity). This was demonstrated by explicit uncertainty reports that closely tracked the current variance, and only showed sustained changes following change points in variance but not mean. Together, these results show that humans adapt their learning strategy to both how and what aspects of the environment are changing. They establish a unified computational account of adaptive learning across different environmental dynamics.",

      "title": "Regional brain age deviations reveal divergent developmental pathways in youth",
      "content": "Background. Normative modeling of brain development has gained traction for quantifying individual deviations in maturation. The brain age gap (BAG), the difference between predicted age from MRI features and chronological age, offers a potential individualized normative metric of neurodevelopment. However, consistent patterns across psychiatric disorders remain elusive, and no studies have examined whether BAG can predict developmental trajectories within an inclusive continuous model of youth cognition and behavior. Methods. Using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ages 9-15, n=9,074), we built 8 region-specific brain age models using volumes, thicknesses, and surface areas of parcels from the Brainnetome adolescent atlas. We derived psychiatric diagnoses from a parental questionnaire. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess case-control differences and cross-sectional continuous cognitive/behavioral profiles. We modeled cognitive/behavioral trajectories using a multivariate joint latent-class mixed model and assessed the relationship with BAG values using multinomial logistic regression. Results. Children with ADHD showed delayed maturation across multiple regions (Cohen d: -0.12 to -0.08), while subcortical BAG emerged as a transdiagnostic indicator of delayed development (d: -0.07, pfdr = 0.024). Accelerated maturation characterized the high cognition and low symptom profile, while the inverse was found for the low cognition profile. Three developmental trajectories were identified: stable, towards externalizing behaviors, or internalizing behaviors. Widespread accelerated maturation predicted evolution towards internalizing behaviors but was protective against the externalizing trajectory. Conclusions. Integrating BAG with continuous cognitive and behavioral profiles yielded a plausible framework for early identification of atypical trajectories, potentially contributing to personalized medicine in psychiatry.",
