      "title": "Pain-regulation circuitry as a predictor of chronic pain phenotypes",
      "content": "Background: Chronic pain is a multidimensional condition in which emotional distress, negative expectations, and functional impairment signal greater disease severity. Standard diagnostic categories often fail to capture clinically meaningful heterogeneity, highlighting the need for mechanistic phenotyping. Methods: We studied 159 individuals with fibromyalgia or chronic low back pain and 72 healthy controls. Participants completed a cue-based expectation task with calibrated thermal stimuli. Principal component and cluster analyses were used to derive high and low pain, disability, and affective distress (PDA) phenotypes. Groups were compared on expectation-induced pain modulation (EIPM) and resting state connectivity of periaqueductal gray (PAG) subregions. Stepwise machine learning models evaluated whether clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging features could classify PDA phenotypes. Results: High PDA patients exhibited impaired pain modulation when positive expectations were violated, particularly under low-threat cues (P<0.05), and reported higher catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and medication use than low PDA patients. Resting-state analyses revealed more negative dorsolateral/lateral PAG to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex coupling in the high PDA group. Machine learning models classified PDA subtypes above chance, with maximal accuracy when PAG connectivity was combined with clinical and behavioral measures. Conclusions: Severe chronic pain characterized by high emotional distress, disability, and pain is associated with disrupted expectation driven modulation and altered PAG connectivity. Integrating symptom profiles with neural and behavioral markers provides a biologically informed framework for identifying phenotypes with distinct treatment needs. These results suggest that expectation-related pain regulation and midbrain circuitry represent complementary mechanistic targets for precision interventions in chronic pain.",

      "content": "Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) has been proposed as an elegant neural mechanism for representing sequential items in memory, coordinating distant brain regions, and parsing complex sensory inputs. Yet, whether PAC carries content-specific, behaviorally meaningful information has not been demonstrated to date. Here, using human intracranial recordings before, during and after an audio-visual associative learning task, we show that PAC is an information-coding mechanism. PAC strength in cortico-hippocampal networks increased linearly during learning and remained significantly stronger post vs. pre-learning. More importantly, PAC comodulograms carried stimulus- and association-specific information: auditory items were decodable in auditory cortex before learning based on PAC features, while learned associations were classified across hippocampo-temporo-frontal networks during and after learning. Post-learning brain decoding confusion matrices closely mirrored behavioral confusion matrices, and PAC patterns were independent of low-level stimulus features. These findings suggest that PAC is an endogenously generated marker that supports perception and associative learning in the human brain.",

      "content": "Overarching conceptualizations propose a critical role of the default mode network (DMN) in self-referential mental time travel, particularly in autobiographical memory retrieval and episodic future thinking, and internal (intrinsic) emotion generation and regulation. However, these conceptualizations have not been directly evaluated. Against this background, the present fMRI study aimed to identify both shared and distinct neural systems underlying autobiographical episodic processing across different temporal contexts - specifically, episodic memory retrieval (EMR) and episodic future thinking (EFT) - and to examine how these systems interact with affective experiences, including valence and arousal. Our findings demonstrated the central role of the DMN - encompassing the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and medial temporal lobe (MTL) - in both EMR and EFT. Importantly, we identified a functional dissociation along both valence and temporal dimensions: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was more strongly associated with positive experiences and simulations, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was consistently engaged during the processing of negative affect across past and future contexts. Moreover, representational similarity and parametric analyses indicated that the hippocampus supports differential processing of valence and arousal across temporal domains. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence for the involvement of cortical midline core DMN systems in autobiographical processing across time and suggest overlapping and distinct systems for the integration of emotional experiences across mental time travel.",

      "title": "Molecular and Cellular Underpinnings of Spatial Heterogeneity in Fetal Cortical Folding",
      "content": "Cortical folding is a defining feature of human brain development, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms that produce regionally specific cortical folding remain incompletely understood. Here we combined high-resolution in-utero T2-weighted and diffusion MRI atlases (23-38 weeks of gestational age) with prenatal transcriptomic profiles to map regional macrostructural and microstructural features of cortical folding to underlying gene expression. We found genes whose expression patterns correlated with cortical curvature were enriched for neurogenesis, progenitor proliferation and radial glia guided neuronal migration, and localized to ventricular zone/subventricular zone progenitor cell subtypes, supporting for the protomap hypothesis of areal specification. By contrast, cortical microstructural markers-associated gene sets were implicated in myelination, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling, and mapped to astrocyte and endothelial cell programs. The microstructure-related gene expression peaked in the early postnatal period and remained high throughout childhood, while the curvature-associated gene expression reduced with age. Several of these cortical folding-related genes overlapped with autism spectrum disorder risk loci (e.g., SCN2A, STXBP1, DVL3). Collectively, these cross-modal findings outline a sequential developmental architecture--early progenitor driven patterning followed by myelin and extracellular matrix consolidation. In addition, we released a high-resolution fetal labeling atlas to facilitate further imaging-genetic studies of early cortical development.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",
