      "title": "Mapping of critical prosodic and phonetic networks in post-stroke apraxia of speech",
      "content": "Purpose: Many have made proposals to better diagnose and/or classify post-stroke apraxia of speech (AOS), with some arguing for the separation of AOS into behavioral subtypes. Recent studies of primary progressive AOS have promoted a separation of prosodic and phonetic subtypes, aligning with a dual-motor coordination model separating the neural substrates of prosodic and phonetic function. Motivated by the limited corroboration of these subtypes in post-stroke AOS, here we present mapping results in a cohort of stroke survivors aiming to identify distinct neural substrates for prosodic and phonetic aspects of speech motor coordination. Methods: Left-hemisphere stroke survivors (n = 127; 64 with AOS) received speech-language evaluation and neuroimaging at the Center for the Study and Treatment of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR). AOS severity was quantified via the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale (ASRS). We utilized a novel lesion-symptom mapping technique with an emphasis on prediction that identifies ensembles of regions supporting performance in the prosodic and phonetic domains. Results: An ensemble of networks supporting prosodic function localized to dorsal and ventral (but primarily dorsal) sensorimotor cortex, as well as a distributed network of white matter pathways connecting Rolandic cortex to auditory regions and cerebellum, emphasizing the role of auditory feedback processing and laryngeal control in supporting prosodic function. A separate but partially overlapping network supporting phonetic function localized primarily to ventral Rolandic cortex and the arcuate fasciculus. Conclusions: This work represents the first mapping of prosodic and phonetic subtypes in post-stroke AOS in a large cohort of individuals. We hope our results motivate the development of assessment and treatment techniques individually targeting prosodic and phonetic functioning to better serve individuals with AOS and facilitate clinical discussion of the disorder.",

      "title": "Ectopic engraftment of nociceptive neurons derived from hPSCs for pain relief and joint homeostasis",
      "content": "Chronic pain arises from the interplay of inflammatory signals that activate and sensitize nociceptors within injured tissues. Most analgesics fail clinically due to their mono targeted mechanisms. Here, we apply human pluripotent stem cell derived nociceptive neurons (hPSC NNs) as therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis, targeting both pain and joint degeneration. We generated sensory neurons from hPSCs and identified CD200 as a nociceptor marker. Transcriptomic and functional profiling revealed that CD200high hPSC NNs closely resemble human nociceptors, expressing pain relevant receptors and ion channels. Strikingly, ectopic transplantation of CD200high hPSC NNs into the knee joint of osteoarthritic mice reduced pain and promoted bone and cartilage repair, whereas CD200low cells exhibited no benefit. Mechanistically, human and mouse proteomics suggest that CD200high hPSC NNs act as decoys by sequestering inflammatory ligands while secreting reparative factors in joint tissues. These findings uncover a fundamental role of nociceptors in tissue repair, providing a multi-targeted, disease modifying strategy for OA and chronic pain.",

      "title": "Prion shedding is reduced by chronic wasting disease vaccination",
      "content": "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a strictly fatal and highly contagious prion disease of wild and farmed cervids currently expanding in North America. Prion diseases are caused by conversion of the cellular prion protein to its pathological isoform PrPSc. Vaccination is considered a promising strategy to contain CWD, even though prion diseases do not show classical immune responses. For CWD containment, it is important that vaccines reduce shedding of prions in excreta, a major contributor to transmission. Here, we tested the effect of vaccines on prion shedding in feces and urine by vaccinating and prion infecting knock-in mice that recapitulate CWD pathogenesis as found in cervids. Vaccination reduced or even prevented CWD shedding in feces and urine collected between 30-90% of incubation time to disease. This is the first report showing that prion shedding can be blocked in a prion disease. For CWD specifically it may reduce the environmental prion burden and break the disease transmission cycle.",

      "title": "Integrating brain structure and function for the neurobiology and genetics of language",
      "content": "Brain structure and function have largely been studied separately in relation to the neurobiology and genetics of language. Here we used linked independent component analysis to integrate language network functional connectivity with brain volumetric and white matter structure in 32,677 UK Biobank participants, followed by analysis of behavioural, neurobiological and genetic correlates of the derived multimodal structure-function imaging components. Stronger functional connectivity between brain language areas was associated with increased volume of parts of the cerebellum and motor cortex, together with smaller ventricles and sensory parietal and occipital areas. The brain structure-function language components mediated an association between vocabulary level and polygenic scores for reading ability. We report 18 genomic loci associated with brain structure-function language components. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimates for these components were 23-30%, and there was significant enrichment of heritability in primate-conserved genomic loci and fetal brain human-gained enhancer elements. This study revealed that structural correlates of functional language network connectivity extend well beyond previously defined language areas of the brain, and highlights the value of multimodal brain phenotyping for human neurogenetic discovery.",

      "title": "Inconsistent Subthalamic Beta Expression in the Local Field Potential amid In- and Anti-Phasic Neuronal Bursts.",
      "content": "Background: Elevated beta (12-32 Hz) activity in the local field potential (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and closely tied to synchronized spiking. Albeit the biomarker's prevalence has not been independently and reliably assessed, it is employed to guide deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implantation. Likewise, beta is under investigation to inform DBS programming and adaptive DBS. This study assesses the applicability of these efforts by quantifying the biomarker's prevalence and investigating its relationship to synchronized beta-bursting neurons. Methods: STN LFP and spiking activity of n = 156 patients with Parkinson's disease from six DBS centers recorded via microelectrodes was examined. Spectral peaks in the LFPs were classified and the absence of artifacts confirmed. The distribution of phase angles between beta LFP and spiking of individual beta-bursting neurons were explored. Findings: Bilateral beta LFP expression was observed in 47.25% of patients, and in 65.59% of hemispheres. LFP-synchronized neuronal spiking clustered in two-thirds of neurons at a primary and in one-third at a secondary LFP phase (182.84 degree phase shifted). This applied on the group level and for individual patients across different DBS centers. Interpretation: Beta-informed approaches mandate reliable biomarker expression, a requirement not met by slightly more than half of herein investigated patients. This is particularly troublesome for intraoperative guidance wherein the cause of biomarker absence, including DBS lead misplacement or a balanced ratio of phasic and antiphasic spiking neurons, cannot be determined, decreasing insight and increasing doubt. Although beta LFPs remain a valuable biomarker, routine clinical practice should not rely on beta alone; instead, multiple biomarkers (i.e. beta-gamma coupling, finely tuned gamma and/or cortico-cortical beta-band coupling) should be evaluated simultaneously to increase robustness.",

      "title": "LIVN: A testbed for learning to interact with in vitro neural networks",
      "content": "The investigation of cultured biological neural networks is a critical frontier in neuroscience with profound implications for the advancement of brain-machine interfaces, treatments of neurological diseases, and fundamental insights into neural computation and cognition. Advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and machine learning are converging to enable novel approaches to interrogating neural circuits in vitro. However, progress in this emerging field is hampered by the technical challenges and resource-intensive nature of acquiring datasets suitable for machine learning. Experimental recordings typically do not allow for interactive learning and generally lack ground-truth information that would enable rigorous algorithm development and validation. To overcome the limitations of experimental setups, simulated biophysical models of neurons and neuronal networks can serve as crucial accelerators. They allow for more controlled and systematic exploration than currently possible with living cultures and serve as interpretable intermediaries between abstract computational theory and complex biological reality. Using this approach, we introduce livn: an open source interactive simulation environment for learning to control in vitro neural networks. livn generates synthetic neural data with ground truth at scale, enabling the development and testing of ML models in interactive settings that mimic experimental platforms. We describe benchmark tasks that challenge ML models to exploit simulated neural dynamics and release generated synthetic datasets that mimic in vitro systems. By providing an open, extensible platform for developing and benchmarking machine learning models, livn aims to accelerate progress in both ML-driven understanding and engineering of in vitro neural systems and fundamental understanding of computation in biological neural networks.",

      "content": "Homeotherms maintain a steady body temperature through thermoregulation, a process critical for survival during fasting, in which the brain has to defend energy-costly body temperature while reducing energy expenditure to conserve energy reserve; however, the neural basis for defending body temperature remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that AgRP neuron lesion led to lethality during time-restricted feeding but no obvious impact on HFD-induced obesity or obesity-reducing responses to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism. The lesion disrupted adaptive feeding behaviors during time-restricted feeding and reduced motivational feeding. Notably, the lethality was caused by hypothermia instead of reduced food intake. The lesion also caused failure in body temperature maintenance during acute fasting in cold. Fasting-induced activation in AgRP neurons was abrogated when mice were placed in a warm environment. Our results identify the physiological role for AgRP neurons in defending body temperature during restricted feeding but dispensable for body weight regulation with food ad libitum.",

      "title": "Lysergic acid diethylamide pretreatment prolongs brain-stimulation induced neural activity",
      "content": "A leading theory for how psychedelics are able to produce robust clinical improvement and preclinical behavioral changes is that psychedelics act through neuroplastic mechanisms to induce lasting structural and functional alterations in neural circuits. However, psychedelics produce these effects across wide swaths of the brain. Based on our prior work, we hypothesized that engaging a specific brain circuit with focal brain stimulation during the window of enhanced plasticity produced by psychedelics would lead to more persistent alterations in the activity of that circuit. To test this, we administered either saline (SAL) or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to rats 24 hours prior to electrical stimulation targeting the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Brain activity was recorded before, during, and after stimulation using depth electrodes implanted in four bilateral frontostriatal regions. To assess changes in neural activity, we trained general logistic classifiers to distinguish between time points (e.g., pre-stimulation vs. post-stimulation) and then compared model performances across groups (e.g., LSD vs. SAL). As such, model performance represents the degree of difference between the two neural states (pre vs. post), and a significant difference between groups indicates a larger change in brain activity in one group. We found that LSD pretreatment, compared to SAL, resulted in larger and longer-lasting changes in brain activity following stimulation. Immunohistochemistry revealed that stimulation led to the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway, and the combination of LSD and stimulation led to alterations in perineuronal net (PNN) integrity. Regardless of pretreatment, brain activity states recorded during stimulation did not capture the brain state that persisted in the minutes or days that followed. This work has important implications for understanding the general effects of brain stimulation and provides strong support for the development of psychedelic-assisted brain stimulation approaches. By increasing the durability of brain stimulation-induced changes in activity, this approach could lead to a reduction in relapse rates, which currently limit the impact of non-invasive stimulation treatments.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",
