If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "title": "Gonadal and sex chromosomal contributions to sex differences in mammalian brain organization",
      "content": "Sex differences in brain development may contribute to well-known sex differences in behavior and neuropsychiatric risk - making it important to comprehensively map and mechanistically annotate normative sex differences in brain organization. Most sex differences in mammalian brain organization have previously been attributed to differential effects of gonadal hormones based on outcomes from rodent endocrine manipulations at canonical subcortical foci of male-biased brain volume. However, a systematic quantification of both gonadal and sex chromosome dosage (SCD) contributions across all regions of sex-biased brain volume has been lacking. Here, using structural neuroimaging scans from wild-type (n=670) and transgenic mice that dissociate gonadal, X-, and Y-chromosome effects (n=181), we show that: many more brain regions are volumetrically sex-biased than previously recognized; gonadal effects dominate throughout this expanded map of sex differences; several regions also show prominent SCD contributions to anatomical sex differences, which can both reinforce or counteract gonadal effects in a regionally specific manner. Targeted single nucleus RNA sequencing at a region of female-biased cerebellar volume reveals that combined gonadal and SCD effects also drive sex-biased cellular gene expression. These findings revise our understanding of the spatial distribution and causal basis of sex-differences in the mammalian brain, illuminating a key axis of biological variation in health and disease.",

      "title": "Abnormal neuronal and synaptic morphology in Down syndrome brains reproduces in 2D and 3D human cellular models",
      "content": "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common autosomal aneuploidy compatible with postnatal survival and is caused by full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. In this study, human isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into 2D neurons and cortico-striatal assembloids (hCSAs). Aberrant neuronal morphology was observed: trisomic (T21) neurons formed aggregates of cell bodies interconnected with thick neurite bundles radiating outwards, connected and overlapped with other neurons in between the bundles while disomic (D21) neurons were evenly distributed across the surface and formed strong neuronal networks. Detailed analysis revealed significantly shorter neurites with larger diameter, fewer branches, and fewer terminal points in T21 neurons compared to D21 neurons in both 2D cultures and hCSAs. We observed similar phenotypes in foetal and postnatal human brain tissue. Furthermore, we observed aberrant mitochondrial morphology with an excess of some mitochondrial proteins (AIF, TOMM20) and significantly lower expression of synaptic markers (SYN-1, PSD95 and GEPH) throughout in vitro differentiation of T21 neurons. Finally, our data showed that T21 spheroids were significantly smaller throughout differentiation compared to D21 spheroids. T21 spheroids also exhibited significantly higher expression of neural stem cells (SOX2), significantly lower expression of proliferating cells (Ki67) and significantly higher expression of apoptotic cells (CCaspase-3). Overall, our study demonstrates that trisomy 21 leads to aberrant neuronal morphology in both 2D neurons and hCSAs, consistent with observations in the human brain.",

      "content": "Amyloid-beta presence in the caudate nucleus (Ca) partially defines Thal stage III in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about AD's cellular impact on the region. Leveraging a public basal ganglia taxonomy of cellular populations, we generated a cellular-resolution atlas of AD-associated pathological changes in Ca. Unlike cortex, we found that Ca AD pathology is dominated by two key features: phosphorylated tau (pTau)-containing neuropil threads enriched near oligodendrocytes in white matter tracts and amyloid-beta diffuse plaques enriched in gray matter. Although AD pathology in affected cortical regions results in neuronal loss, we find no AD-driven reductions in neuron proportions in Ca. However, there were observable changes in multiple cellular populations. Protoplasmic astrocytes and FLT1+/IL1B+ microglia increased in abundance with global pTau levels. We also observe gene expression changes in fast-spiking PTHLH-PVALB interneurons indicative of disrupted signaling pathways and altered intrinsic physiological properties. This work provides a cellular-resolution framework for understanding AD pathology in Ca.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",
