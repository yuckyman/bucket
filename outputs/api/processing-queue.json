      "title": "No evidence of neural feature-specific pre-activation during the prediction of an upcoming stimulus",
      "content": "Our brains constantly make predictions about upcoming events based on prior knowledge of the environment. Although several neural mechanisms have been proposed to support this capacity, it is not yet clear how the brain makes such predictions. A compelling hypothesis is that the brain pre-activates a sensory template of a predictable stimulus before it appears. In a recent study, Demarchi et al. had participants listen to sequences of sounds with different levels of predictability. For some sequences, participants could anticipate the next sound (in regular sequences), for others not (in random sequences). Using magnetoencephalography recordings and machine-learning methods to decode sounds from brain signals, Demarchi et al. concluded that auditory predictions pre-activate tone-specific neural templates before the sound onset. In our reanalysis of their data, we demonstrate that their results can be fully explained by a bias induced by the structure of the sequences: because the most likely stimulus also happens to be physically close to the previous one, spurious higher-than-chance decoding performance arises before the sound onset. We provide general criteria to assess whether a study is affected by this confound and requires a reexamination. We conclude that there is no evidence of anticipatory predictive perception in the Demarchi et al. dataset, and that existing evidence for feature-specific pre-activation during prediction in humans remains inconclusive.",

      "title": "Opposite Priming Effects on Identity vs. Category Recognition Require Conscious Awareness",
      "content": "How conscious and unconscious priming differentially modulate object recognition at different levels of abstraction (identity vs. category) remains incompletely understood, despite extensive research. We used a binocular rivalry paradigm with Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS) to manipulate conscious awareness with image or word primes while participants performed a name-picture verification task probing identity and category recognition for faces and animal bodies. Behavioral results revealed a striking dissociation: consciously perceived primes facilitated identity recognition but impaired category recognition. This effect was most pronounced with image primes, face targets, and right visual field presentations. Under unconscious priming, no such effects were observed. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we applied a Drift Diffusion Model, which revealed that conscious priming selectively enhanced the efficiency of evidence accumulation and introduced a pre-decisional bias for identity decisions, with no reliable change for category decisions. Our findings demonstrate a double dissociation where conscious awareness is required for priming to exert robust and opposite effects on identity and category recognition. This finding challenges the view of priming as a uniformly facilitatory process, providing a new mechanistic framework for understanding how consciousness and abstraction level interact to shape visual perception.",

      "title": "The energetic cost of human standing balance and gait initiation over a range of natural postures",
      "content": "Humans typically select movements that minimize energetic cost, a principle most clearly observed during locomotion. Whether such optimization of energy expenditure also governs standing balance remains unclear because its energetic cost has not been systematically quantified across a range of natural postures. Moreover, because standing is often the resting state from which most walking begins, the optimization of posture may also reflect the energetic demands of initiating gait. In this study, we use a combination of indirect calorimetry and musculoskeletal simulations to characterize the energetic cost of standing and gait initiation across natural standing postures and investigate whether humans optimize energy expenditure under these conditions. In Experiment 1 (N = 13), we measured metabolic cost at preferred and six different prescribed whole-body orientations. Energy expenditure was lowest at a slight anterior orientation (1.15{degrees}) and increased monotonically with whole-body angle, rising twice as fast posteriorly compared to anteriorly. This asymmetry challenges the common modeling simplification that effort is symmetric and linear or quadratic with lean angle. Furthermore, participants preferred body orientations (1.50 {+/-} 0.73{degrees}) with similar energy expenditure to the minimum-cost orientation but with significantly more postural variability, suggesting that strict postural regulation was not necessary for energy-optimal control. In Experiment 2 (N = 20), participants initiated forward and backward walking from preferred or prescribed lean orientations. Participants did not alter their standing posture before expected gait initiations in the forward or backward direction, consistent with musculoskeletal simulations showing that leaning further in the anticipated direction did not significantly improve gait initiation time or energetic costs. Together, these findings suggest that postural strategies optimize energy efficiency when permitted by the demands of movement readiness. Our study quantifies the energetic cost landscape that governs human postural control, challenges widely used inverted pendulum estimations of this cost, and offers an empirical foundation for developing more accurate simulations of posture and energy expenditure.",

      "title": "Ultrastructural Analysis of Human Uncinate Fasciculus with Spectral-Focusing Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy",
      "content": "Characterizing the ultrastructure of myelin in the human brain is key to understanding the neurobiology of both health and disease. In postmortem human brain tissue, electron microscopy is often technically unfeasible due to poorer tissue quality. The uncinate fasciculus (UF) is a long-range white matter association tract that connects the anterior temporal lobe with the orbitofrontal cortex. The UF is not present in rodents yet is highly expanded in humans and non-human primates. As such, its molecular and ultrastructural properties are virtually unknown. Here, we develop and validate a novel spectral-focusing Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Spectroscopy (sf-CARS) system coupled with a custom AxonDeepSeg segmentation model to characterize UF ultrastructure in the human postmortem brain (n=6). We provide a proof of concept of this new methodological pipeline in the UF temporal segment and observe that the mean axon diameter detected is 0.93 m {+/-} 0.54 and mean myelin thickness is 0.48 m {+/-} 0.14. We also observe that the UF axons are thicker than those in the anterior cingulate cortex white matter. We detail and validate the full methodology, including tissue fixation and sectioning, sf-CARS acquisition settings, as well as the AxonDeepSeg deep learning model parameters such that this pipeline can be utilized by others in the field.",

      "content": "<p><i>MiRNA</i>-based therapeutics represent a promising approach for treating multiple diseases, yet the key regulatory <i>miRNAs</i> in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-related cognitive impairment remains unclear. Here, we identify <i>miR-153</i> as consistently upregulated in both male and female mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and late-stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, as well as in the basal forebrain of both male and female postmortem AD specimens and male CCH rats. Knockdown of <i>miR-153</i> in the basal forebrain alleviated CCH-induced cognitive deficits. Mechanistically, <i>miR-153</i> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <i>miR-153</i> suppressed <i>KPNA5</i> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction. Restoration of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in the basal forebrain alleviated oxidative stress damage in male CCH rats, while no such effect was observed in the hippocampus. These findings reveal a potential role of the <i>miR-153</i>-KPNA5-NRF2 axis in CCH-related cognitive decline.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",
