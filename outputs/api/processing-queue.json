      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Bayesian multilevel modeling of group and participant level effect sizes: Stronger inter-individual differences in pupil dilation compared to EEG alpha power during aversive conditioning",
      "content": "Aversive conditioning prompts reliable changes in the power of EEG alpha-band oscillations and pupil dilation. Both variables have been used to test hypotheses on the acquisition, generalization, and extinction of conditioned threat. Existing studies have largely relied on trial averages and group-level analyses. Thus, the variability of these physiological markers to aversive learning at the subject level is currently unknown. Comparisons of group-level analyses in prior studies suggest that pupil dilation and EEG-alpha activity capture complementary information. However, to date, no study has directly compared these two markers in terms of their effect sizes at the level of individual participants. The present study employed Bayesian multilevel modeling to quantify the variability of conditioning effect estimates for alpha-band power and pupillometry. Estimates were examined at the group level and at the participant level, across two conditioning paradigms, involving visual and auditory cues. Although the two metrics shared similar effect sizes at the group level, participant-level variability in these effect sizes was substantially higher for pupil-dilation compared to alpha-power, and this finding was replicated across both paradigms. These findings have important implications for clinical and inter-individual difference research which requires both the quantification of effects at the participant-level as well as meaningful variability between-participants that can be linked to relevant differences such as anxiety.",

      "title": "Structured Neural Variability from Repeated Naturalistic Video Watching Experiences",
      "content": "The brain continuously integrates perception and interpretation processes to navigate dynamic environments. It is often assumed that these processes are invariant to repeated experiences. Here we investigated how neural responses to naturalistic stimuli evolve across multiple viewings using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty participants watched 24 short videos across five separate scanning sessions. Between-subject correlations (BSC) decreased progressively across all brain regions with repeated viewing, indicating increasing individual variability. Within-subject correlations (WSC) consistently exceeded BSC, demonstrating that individuals are more similar to themselves than to others. However, the structure of within-subject variability differed fundamentally between sensory and interpretive regions. Early visual cortex exhibited strong repetition effects, with brain activity becoming increasingly dissimilar with each successive viewing, accompanied by reduced coupling to low-level visual features and decreased anti-correlation with default mode regions. In contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed temporal proximity effects, where sessions closer in time exhibited more similar activity patterns regardless of viewing number. This temporal structure in vmPFC aligned with fluctuations in participants' video preferences across sessions. These findings suggest that repeated experiences are never processed identically: sensory systems adapt efficiently to familiar input while interpretive systems continuously reshape meaning based on current internal states.",

      "title": "Theta Activity Supports Landmark-Based Correction of Naturalistic Human Path Integration",
      "content": "<p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<i>.</i></p>",
