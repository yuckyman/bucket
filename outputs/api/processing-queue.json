      "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

      "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
      "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

      "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

      "title": "White matter microstructure in mid- to late adulthood is influenced by pathway-stratified polygenic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease involves progressive white matter microstructural degeneration that may precede clinical symptoms by decades. While polygenic risk scores (PRS) quantify cumulative genetic liability for AD, genome-wide PRS lack mechanistic specificity. We tested whether pathway-specific PRS, targeting areas of biology including tau binding, lipid metabolism, and immune response, are differentially associated with diffusion MRI measures across the lifespan.MethodsWe analyzed two population-based cohorts: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; mean age = 19.8 years, n = 517) and UK Biobank (mean age = 64.2 years, n = 18,172). Genome-wide and nine pathway-specific PRS for Alzheimer\u2019s disease were constructed using GWAS summary statistics and a clumping threshold of r2 < 0.2 at p < 0.001. Diffusion MRI data were processed separately within each cohort: in ALSPAC, tract-based fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted using probabilistic tractography from native-space regions of interest; in UK Biobank, diffusion metrics were derived from TBSS-aligned skeletons and standard atlas-based ROIs. Analyses focused on three tracts vulnerable to early AD pathology: the dorsal cingulum, parahippocampal cingulum, and fornix. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess PRS associations with FA and MD, adjusting for demographic, scanner, and genetic ancestry covariates. False discovery rate correction addressed multiple comparisons, and sensitivity analyses were performed excluding the APOE region.ResultsIn UK Biobank, higher PRS for protein\u2013lipid complex assembly and tau protein binding were robustly associated with lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity in both dorsal and parahippocampal cingulum segments (False discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05), explaining more variance than APOE alone; no significant effects emerged in the fornix. Genome-wide PRS showed weaker, non-significant associations. In ALSPAC, no PRS metric survived FDR correction, though nominal trends appeared in the dorsal cingulum. Sensitivity analyses confirmed that key cingulum associations in older adults persisted after omitting APOE.ConclusionPathway-specific polygenic risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease manifests in white matter microstructure by mid- to late adulthood but not in early adulthood, suggesting an age-dependent emergence of genetic effects. dMRI phenotypes may thus serve as intermediate biomarkers for dissecting mechanistic pathways of preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease vulnerability.",

      "title": "Localization performance of cochlear implant users with a real-time bilaterally-synchronized sound coding strategy that provides explicit interaural timing cues with mixed rates of stimulation",
      "content": "IntroductionBilateral cochlear implants (BiCIs) do not restore sound localization abilities to the full extent exhibited by typical hearing (TH) listeners, partly due to poor encoding of interaural time differences (ITDs). ITD cues have been provided and investigated using synchronized research processors that ensure the precise delivery of ITD cues. These studies have been conducted in a direct stimulation setting, which bypasses the processor microphones and, in most cases, removes interaural level difference cues (ILDs). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated the efficacy of synchronized stimulation in restoring sensitivity to ITDs in a free field localization experiment. This was made possible by the CCi-MOBILE, a portable and real-time processing research platform that allows for synchronizing microphone inputs.MethodsFourteen BiCI listeners were tested with experimental real-time coding strategies in comparison to unsynchronized clinical processors. We calculated the binaural cues from the acoustic stimuli at the level of microphone input.ResultsThe recordings show that the experimental coding strategies in this study deliver ITDs with greater precision than the clinical strategy. However, psychophysical testing did not show the benefit of an ITD-encoding strategy in improving localization in a free field. The ITD encoding strategies preserved ITDs, which better differentiated unique loudspeaker locations than interaural level differences (ILDs), suggesting that listeners could achieve improved performance if they accessed these cues. As expected, ILDs were similar across all strategies, including the ITD encoding strategies. The lack of improvement in localization performance is likely because ILDs remained to be the dominant cue in acute localization testing, even when ITD cues were available.DiscussionProviding BiCI listeners with adequate experiences with ITD cues may be necessary to shift their reliance from ILD dominance to a combined reliance on ILD and ITD cues in free-field conditions. The CCi-MOBILE could enable take-home practice with novel stimulation strategies for extended experiences and long-term evaluation in real-world listening environments.",

      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",
