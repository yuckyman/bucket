      "content": "<p>Kalendis is an API-first scheduling backend. You keep your UI; we handle the gnarly parts (recurrence, time zones, DST, conflict-safe bookings).<p>What it does: \u2022 MCP tool: generates typed clients and API route handlers (Next.js/Express/Fastify/Nest) so you can scaffold calls straight from your IDE/agent tooling. \u2022 Availability engine: recurring rules + one-off exceptions/blackouts, returned in a clean, queryable shape. \u2022 Bookings: conflict-safe endpoints for creating/updating/canceling slots.<p>Why we built it: We kept rebuilding the same \"hard parts\" of scheduling: time zones/DST edge cases, recurring availability, conflict-aware booking, etc.\nWe wanted a boring, reliable backend so we could ship product features without adopting a hosted scheduling UI.<p>How it's helped: We stopped re-implementing DST/recurrence math and shipped booking flows faster. One small team (just 2 developers) built a robust booking platform for their business using Kalendis\u2014they kept full control of their UX without spending lots of cycles on scheduling infrastructure. The MCP generator cut the glue code: drop in a typed client or route, call the API, move on.<p>Some tech details: \u2022 REST API with ISO-8601 timestamps and IANA time zones \u2022 Recurring availability + one-off exceptions (designed to compose cleanly) \u2022 Focused scope: users, availability, exceptions, bookings (not a monolithic suite)<p>The MCP server exposes tools like generate-frontend-client, generate-backend-client, generate-api-routes, and list-endpoints. Add to your MCP settings:<p><pre><code>  {\n   \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"kalendis\": {\n     \"command\": \"npx\",\n     \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@kalendis/mcp\"]\n    }\n   }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nHow to try it: Create a free account \u2192 get an API key. (<a href=\"https://kalendis.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kalendis.dev</a>). Then hit an endpoint:<p><pre><code>  curl -H \"x-api-key: $KALENDIS_API_KEY\" \\\n \"https://api.kalendis.dev/v1/availability/getAvailability?userId=&amp;start=2025-10-07T00:00:00Z&amp;end=2025-10-14T00:00:00Z&amp;includeExceptions=true\"\n</code></pre>\nHappy to answer questions and post example snippets in the thread. Thanks for taking a look!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",
