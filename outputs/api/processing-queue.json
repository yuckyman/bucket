      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

      "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
      "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

      "title": "Aperiodic brain activity changes in patients with stroke following virtual reality-based upper limb robotic rehabilitation: a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial",
      "content": "IntroductionStroke-related brain changes have traditionally been studied through oscillatory electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, but recent evidence highlights the value of aperiodic components. This pilot randomized controlled trial aimed to assess stroke-related aperiodic EEG changes following virtual reality-based robotic rehabilitation using the Spectral Exponent Index (SEI).MethodsNineteen patients with subacute stroke were randomized to unilateral (n = 9) or bilateral (n = 10) upper limb training with a robotic exoskeleton (30 sessions). EEG was recorded at rest before (T0), after (T1), and at 1-week follow-up (T2). SEI was computed for hemispheric and sensorimotor clusters, in affected (AH) and unaffected (UH) hemispheres. Clinical evaluation was performed at T0 and T1 with validated clinical scales.ResultsAt T0, the SEI in the sensorimotor cluster of the AH was significantly lower than in the UH. At T1, the SEI in the AH increased together with clinical improvements in upper limb motor function. At T2, the SEI in the AH decreased again and was lower than in the UH. No differences were found between unilateral and bilateral groups.DiscussionRobotic rehabilitation modulated the aperiodic EEG background in the affected hemisphere of patients with stroke, particularly in sensorimotor areas. These SEI changes mirrored motor recovery, suggesting that it may represent a useful biomarker to track localized neural mechanisms of functional improvement after stroke. No differences between unilateral and bilateral training likely reflect the pilot sample size or shared cortical mechanisms of action activated by both rehabilitation approaches.Clinical Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT05176600.",

      "title": "Abnormal connection between the posterior insula and the gastric network among patients with functional constipation",
      "content": "BackgroundFunctional constipation (FCon) is frequently accompanied by psychological disorders, implicating the interaction between the gastrointestinal symptom and brain dysfunction in FCon. Recent studies combining electrogastrogram and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have reported a novel gastric network. Besides, the fMRI activity of the gastric network was also coupled with the insular fMRI signal. However, little is known about the connection between the gastric network and the insula in FCon.MethodsBased on rs-fMRI, functional connectivity (FC) using a large sample of 652 healthy subjects identified the insular cortex as the most closely linked to the gastric network. Then, seed-based FC and dynamic functional connectivity of the gastric network and the gastric-related insular cortex were calculated and compared in 35 patients with FCon and 36 healthy controls. Constipation symptoms were measured using the Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom Scale (PAC-SYM) and the Wexner Constipation Scale. Their relationships with alterations in the gastric network-insula subregion were investigated.ResultsThe posterior insular cortex presented a strong connection with the gastric network with large-scale resting-state fMRI data sets of healthy participants. FCon patients had significantly decreased FC (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.19, p\u202f=\u202f0.032) in the left posterior insula and gastric network compared to healthy controls and were significantly negatively correlated with PAC-SYM (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.407, p\u202f=\u202f0.015) and Wexner Constipation Scale (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.483, p\u202f=\u202f0.003) scores.ConclusionThe abnormality of the connection between the posterior insula and the gastric network may be the prominent neuroimaging feature on FCon, which sheds light on a new perspective on the pathophysiology of FCon.",

      "title": "Glymphatic system and mild traumatic brain injury: a mini review",
      "content": "Since the discovery of the glymphatic system in 2012, research on this brain-wide fluid exchange pathway has focused on understanding its role in different neurological diseases. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a prevalent, yet often undiagnosed, condition that increases the risk of developing debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. mTBI may lead to impaired glymphatic system function and, therefore, accumulation of metabolic waste in the brain. In this review, we summarize 24 studies (10 rodent, 13 human, 1 both) published during 2013\u20132025, reporting post-mTBI changes in the glymphatic system. According to pre-clinical models, potential post-mTBI drivers of glymphatic dysfunction include depolarization of aquaporin 4 water channels and sleep deprivation. In studies on humans, evidence is contradictory; some studies show reduced post-mTBI glymphatic activity, while others report increased activity. However, these studies used different patient populations, which were likely exposed to different mTBI types and post-injury time frames. Furthermore, studies on humans used non-invasive imaging techniques, which only indirectly measure glymphatic activity. Taken together, these inconsistencies point to major gaps in the field, highlighting the need for standardized injury classification and post-injury time frames, and more direct measurements of glymphatic activity in humans. Notably, sleep deprivation, post-concussive symptoms, and cognitive impairment have often been linked to post-injury glymphatic dysfunction. Nevertheless, to better understand mTBI implications on glymphatic system functioning, further research is needed. Such research could help develop novel diagnostics or treatment strategies for mTBI and potentially mitigate the long-term risks of developing neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Spiking neural networks for EEG signal analysis using wavelet transform",
      "content": "IntroductionBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) leverage EEG signal processing to enable human-machine communication and have broad application potential. However, existing deep learning-based BCI methods face two critical limitations that hinder their practical deployment: reliance on manual EEG feature extraction, which constrains their ability to adaptively capture complex neural patterns, and high energy consumption characteristics that make them unsuitable for resource-constrained portable BCI devices requiring edge deployment.MethodsTo address these limitations, this work combines wavelet transform for automatic feature extraction with spiking neural networks for energy-efficient computation. Specifically, we present a novel spiking transformer that integrates a spiking self-attention mechanism with discrete wavelet transform, termed SpikeWavformer. SpikeWavformer enables automatic EEG signal time-frequency decomposition, eliminates manual feature extraction, and provides energy-efficient classification decision-making, thereby enhancing the model's cross-scene generalization while meeting the constraints of portable BCI applications.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SpikeWavformer in emotion recognition and auditory attention decoding tasks.DiscussionThese findings indicate that SpikeWavformer can address the key limitations of existing BCI methods and holds promise for practical deployment in portable, resource-constrained scenarios.",

      "title": "Nicotine and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: unraveling the mechanisms of nicotine addiction",
      "content": "Nicotine, recognized as the principal addictive component in tobacco, is mechanistically linked to its interaction with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels composed of five transmembrane subunits, with the \u03b14\u03b22 receptor subtype being the most common in the brain, playing a crucial role in the behavioral effects of nicotine. When nicotine binds to \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR, it significantly enhances the firing rate and burst firing of dopamine neurons in the brain, thereby activating the mesolimbic dopamine system. This system promotes the formation of nicotine addiction in the early stages of addiction through rewarding sensory stimulation and associative learning. The \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR subunit has been identified as the principal subtype implicated in the pathogenesis of nicotine addiction. However, other nAChRs subtypes also play important roles in the onset and maintenance of nicotine addiction. Understanding the relationship between nicotine addiction and nAChR subtypes is crucial for fully uncovering the neurobiological mechanism behind its addictive properties and lays the foundation for developing more targeted smoking cessation strategies.",

Restoring trust requires a paradigm shift in which scientists accept that the responsibility to champion science lies with us. We propose a new model in which public communication and advocacy are considered as essential to our mission as rigor and reproducibility \u2014 critical not only for safeguarding science, but also for ensuring that its benefits reach all segments of the societies we serve.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
