      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

      "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "Visualization and Morphological Analysis of Individual Oligodendrocytes in the Mouse White Matter",
      "content": "Myelin formation by oligodendrocytes is essential for the regulation of the conduction velocity and proper brain function. To ensure accurate information processing in response to experiences such as sensory stimuli and learning, oligodendrocytes adjust their number and morphology. In addition, oligodendrocyte morphology changes with senescence and in the presence of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, visualizing oligodendrocytes and analyzing their morphology is crucial for understanding how our brains change under such conditions. Herein, we describe the methods for labeling and analyzing the morphologies of individual oligodendrocytes in mouse white matter at the light microscopic level. PDGFRa-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP and PLP-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP mice enable us to visualize and analyze later-born or early-born oligodendrocyte morphology. In addition, sparse oligodendrocyte labeling with attenuated rabies virus expressing GFP enables the visualization and morphological analysis of individual oligodendrocytes in various brain white matter regions without the need for transgenic animals. Furthermore, the combination with immunostaining in thick tissues enables the identification of labeled oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths, as well as their interactions with neuronal axons. These methods are suitable for revealing how oligodendrocytes adapt their morphologies depending on environmental stimuli or pathological conditions.",

      "title": "Integrated analysis implicates novel insights of NMB into lactate metabolism and immune response prediction in primary glioblastoma",
      "content": "Background: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, exhibits profound treatment resistance and poor prognosis. Despite advances in immunotherapy for other cancers, GBM remains refractory, potentially due to its lactate-rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While aerobic glycolysis-driven lactate accumulation is known to acidify the TME and impair immune function, the precise mechanisms linking lactate metabolism to immune evasion in GBM remain elusive. Methods: We integrated multi-omics analyses with machine learning to identify - gene signatures associated lactate metabolism (LM) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Multiple bioinformatic tools were employed to determine the association of key genes with TME remodeling, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivities. Results: Neuromedin B (NMB) emerged as a pivotal regulator of lactate-mediated immunosuppression, correlating strongly with LM and TIDE. We found that NMB expression was remarkably correlated with clinical characteristics, immune response, TME remodeling and drug sensitivities. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that NMB is a key cross-factor in metabolic and immune regulation in GBM. It breaks through the traditional perception that metabolism and immunity are mutually exclusive in cancer by promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and enhancing anti-tumor immunity through its dual functions. It provides a new direction for the combined intervention of metabolic targeting and immunotherapy, and the strong predictive value of NMB expression for drug response further highlights its clinical application potential in the formulation of personalized treatment strategies for GBM patients.",
