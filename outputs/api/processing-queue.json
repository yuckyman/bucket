      "title": "Left-right asymmetry of the microminipig brain.",
      "content": "Left-right asymmetry of the brain is well recognized in various animals including C. elegans, drosophila and zebrafish. In primates, most of the brain studies describe side of the brain. However, in spite of huge amounts of accumulating rodent studies on neuroscience, most of rodent studies do not distinguish the brain side. The pig brain is considered to occupy an intermediate position between primates and rodents in terms of structural complexity and brain function. Moreover, the numbers of studies using genetic manipulation of pigs are drastically increasing. So, we investigated microminipig (MMP) brain mesoscopic anatomy focusing on left-right differences of its morphology. Here, we show anterior cingulate cortex, perirhinal cortex, and cerebellum of MMP, are structurally asymmetrical. Anterior cingulate gurus exhibited protrusion and invagination toward the midline on the right and left side, respectively. The left perirhinal cortex has extra gyrus which are not observed on the right side. The cerebellar vermis, paravermis is tilted from the midline and the consequently the cerebellar cortex exhibits asymmetrical morphology. These data demonstrate that MMPs are one of the suitable model animals for investigating cerebral and cerebellar asymmetry.",

      "title": "Noninvasive and Objective Near Real-Time Detection of Pain Changes in Fluctuating Pain",
      "content": "Chronic pain involves natural intensity fluctuations that patients cannot control, contributing to learned helplessness and functional impairment. Detecting spontaneous pain decreases could enable precisely timed interventions that enhance perceived control. However, existing research on objective pain assessment has focused primarily on estimating static intensity from short, predictable stimuli rather than detecting moment-to-moment changes in ongoing pain. This study investigated whether pain decreases can be detected objectively using easily obtainable physiological signals during fluctuating pain. We recorded multiple physiological signals (8-channel EEG, electrodermal activity, heart rate, pupil diameter, facial expressions) from 42 healthy participants (M_age = 26.2 years, SD = 5.1) during calibrated tonic heat pain stimulation on the left forearm with unpredictable intensity fluctuations (0-70 on visual analogue scale; twelve 3-minute trials). Temperature changes lasted 5-20 seconds. Using minimal preprocessing suitable for real-time applications, we trained state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify pain decreases versus non-decreases from brief temporal windows on a held-out test set (9 participants). Combining electrodermal activity, heart rate, and pupil diameter yielded optimal classification performance using a transformer-based architecture (AUROC = 0.854, accuracy = 76.8%). Electrodermal activity emerged as the most informative single predictor. Continuous stream analysis demonstrated median detection latency of 5.75 seconds with 70.4% sensitivity, reducible to 4.25 seconds at the cost of increased false positives. Results indicate that electrodermal activity and heart rate enable straightforward practical deployment, while highly variable signals such as EEG and facial expressions require personalized fine-tuned models. These findings establish a basis for closed-loop interventions targeting spontaneous pain changes.",

      "title": "Neurogranin enhances spontaneous activity and neuronal survival of hippocampal neurons",
      "content": "Neurogranin (Ng) is a postsynaptic protein highly enriched in forebrain neurons and implicated in synaptic plasticity through its ability to bind calmodulin. However, its impact on neuronal development, network dynamics, and cellular homeostasis remains incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the effects of manipulating Ng expression in primary hippocampal neurons using viral gene delivery, with emphasis on structural, functional, and molecular outcomes. Restoring Ng expression to adult physiological levels enhanced dendritic growth, increased synaptic number, and induced a proximal shift of the axon initial segment, consistent with adaptive responses to increased connectivity. Functionally, Ng markedly increased spontaneous neuronal activity and network synchronization, even under culture conditions that normally show minimal baseline activity. Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced burst firing and spike synchrony, indicating strengthened functional coupling rather than increased membrane excitability. Ng-dependent activity required action potential firing and glutamatergic transmission. At the molecular level, Ng increased total calmodulin levels in a binding-dependent manner, reduced overall calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II abundance while enhancing its relative autophosphorylation, and selectively decreased both total and surface levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors. These changes are consistent with a coordinated homeostatic reorganization of calcium-dependent signaling. Despite robust increases in activity, Ng expression improved neuronal viability, reduced cellular stress markers, and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Active caspase-3 was selectively elevated without triggering apoptosis, suggesting a non-apoptotic role in activity-dependent structural remodeling. Together, these findings identify Ng as a homeostatic regulator that promotes coordinated network activity, adaptive synaptic remodeling, and neuronal survival.",
