      "content": "This paper examines the extent to which large language models (LLMs) are able to perform tasks which require higher-order theory of mind (ToM)\u2014the human ability to reason about multiple mental and emotional states in a recursive manner (e.g., I think that you believe that she knows). This paper builds on prior work by introducing a handwritten test suite\u2014Multi-Order Theory of Mind Q&amp;A\u2014and using it to compare the performance of five LLMs of varying sizes and training paradigms to a newly gathered adult human benchmark. We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on our ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for higher-order ToM performance, and that the linguistic abilities of large models may support more complex ToM inferences. Given the important role that higher-order ToM plays in group social interaction and relationships, these findings have significant implications for the development of a broad range of social, educational and assistive LLM applications.",

      "title": "Placental Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Deficiency Drives Autism-Relevant Behavioral Changes with Sex-Specific Vulnerabilities",
      "content": "Preterm birth and other perinatal adversities lead to loss of placental support including critical hormones, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), required for neurodevelopment. Decreased IGF1 and preterm birth are associated with neurodevelopmental disorder risk, including autism spectrum disorder. Whether placental Igf1 insufficiency impacts these neurodevelopmental risks is not understood. To understand these mechanisms, placental-targeted CRISPR manipulation in mice was employed to create placental Igf1 insufficiency. Subsequently, embryonic forebrain development was assessed sex-specifically to identify structural and transcriptomic changes. Postnatal offspring were used to determine neurobehavioral trajectories relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders as assessed through learning, motor, and affective behavioral tasks and neurostereology. Placental Igf1 insufficiency reduced embryonic forebrain growth, including decreased cell population across males and females. Embryonic forebrain transcriptomics revealed sex-specific alterations. Autism relevant developmental pathways were downregulated in male forebrain, driven by genes including Reln and Lama1. Altered genes in female forebrain were enriched for autism-risk genes including Grin2b and Dync1h1. Following these transcriptomic differences, postnatal neurobehavioral trajectories were sex specific. Male offspring uniquely showed reduced motor learning, increased stereotyped behaviors, altered reversal learning, and reduced forebrain neuronal number. Female offspring displayed opposite behavioral changes as males and few changes in forebrain structure. The provision of Igf1 specifically from placenta is critical for offspring forebrain development. This temporary early deficit has persistent sex-specific neurobehavioral effects. These outcomes have relevance for autism risk and highlight mechanisms that could facilitate intervention development for adverse outcomes after early loss of placental hormone support in perinatal adversity.",

      "title": "Cortical deviance detection represents a canonical difference signal",
      "content": "Context modulates neural processing of sensory stimuli. Neural responses are suppressed to stimuli that are typical in their context and augmented to stimuli that deviate from their context. The latter has been conceptualized as a prediction error, which can serve to enhance the salience, direct attention, or support learning about behaviorally relevant events. Predictive coding theories posit that prediction errors act to signal the difference between internal predictions and actual sensory input, yet most paradigms simultaneously alter both predictions and input, so cannot test for a true difference signal. Increased neural responses to deviants could, instead, encode generalized surprise or augmented bottom-up signaling. Here we compare neural responses to auditory stimuli across oddball paradigm variants. We found that responses of putative excitatory neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) to auditory deviants contain frequency change information and a memory trace of contextual information. Interestingly, in a fixed-deviant oddball paradigm where predictions are altered but deviant input remains constant, neural response patterns encoded standard-to-deviant frequency difference. These results support the interpretation that A1 deviance detection can be interpreted as a sensory prediction error that represents the difference between prediction and sensory input, a corollary of the predictive coding framework.",

      "title": "Microglial Lag3 Drives \u03b1-Synuclein--induced Neurotoxic Activated (A1) Astrocytes and Neurodegeneration",
      "content": "Background Neuroinflammation and pathologic -synuclein (-syn) aggregation cooperate to drive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, but the glial receptors that couple extracellular -syn to inflammatory cascades remain incompletely defined. Microglia express higher levels of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) than neurons, yet the contribution of microglial Lag3 to -syn recognition, glial crosstalk, and neurodegeneration is unknown. Methods Biochemical binding assays, live-cell imaging, cytokine profiling, and neuron-microglia-astrocyte co-culture paradigms were used to define Lag3-dependent -syn preformed fibril (PFF) binding, uptake, and microglial activation. To interrogate in vivo function, microglia-specific Lag3 conditional knockout mice (Lag3L/L-Cx3cr1CreER) and littermate controls received unilateral intrastriatal -syn PFF injections, followed by histological, biochemical, and behavioral assessments of -syn pathology, gliosis, nigrostriatal integrity, and motor performance. Results -syn PFFs bound microglial Lag3 with high specificity and nanomolar affinity and required Lag3 for efficient fibril internalization and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Microglial Lag3 deficiency markedly blunted -syn PFF-evoked microglial activation, prevented cytokine-driven conversion of astrocytes into neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocytes, and abolished astrocyte-dependent neuronal death in vitro. In vivo, microglia-specific Lag3 deletion reduced cortical, striatal, and substantia nigra pS129 -syn pathology, suppressed microgliosis and A1 astrocyte induction, preserved substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine transporter/tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and ameliorated -syn PFF-induced motor deficits. Conclusions This study identifies microglial Lag3 as a key receptor linking extracellular -syn PFF recognition to inflammatory amplification, neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocyte conversion, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Together with prior work on neuronal Lag3, these findings support a cell-type-specific dual-axis model in which neuronal Lag3 mediates -syn propagation while microglial Lag3 drives glia-dependent neurotoxicity, positioning Lag3 as a promising precision therapeutic target in -synucleinopathies.",

      "title": "Disrupted maternal care alters neural-microglia interactions in the primate paralaminar (PL) nucleus of the amygdala.",
      "content": "Prolonged postnatal maturation of the primate amygdala is thought to be driven, at least partially, by continued neural maturation within the paralaminar nucleus (PL). At birth, the PL is densely populated with post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons that gradually mature throughout postnatal life. This active process is likely supported by microglia, which promotes synaptic maturation. Our previous work showed that early life stress associated with maternal separation alters microglia development across the infant to adolescent transition. Here, we examined whether these morphologic microglial changes are associated with alterations in the numbers of pre-synaptic terminals (SYN1+ puncta), post-synaptic terminals (PSD95+ puncta), and putative excitatory contacts (SYN1-PSD95 colocalization), and whether these synaptic elements are engulfed by phagocytic microglia. In maternally reared animals, SYN1+ puncta, PSD95+ puncta, and putative synaptic contacts decreased, while microglial (IBA1+) volume, CD68+ content, and engulfment of synaptic elements increased, between infancy and adolescence. These findings suggest greater pruning of all synaptic elements by adolescence. Maternal separation altered this trajectory, resulting in increased phagocytic activity and engulfment of synaptic elements in infancy, but not in adolescence. Maternal separation also resulted in a 50% reduction in mature PL neurons by adolescence, suggesting maturational failure, cell loss, or both by adolescence. These findings demonstrate that early life stress disrupts normative synaptic pruning and microglia-synapse interactions in the developing primate PL. Increased synaptic engulfment in infants with disrupted care is associated with premature, aberrant pruning, and highlights a potential cellular mechanism through which early environmental insults could change PL neural development by adolescence.",

      "title": "Adaptation response to pitch shift during speech is attenuated upon relearning",
      "content": "IntroductionDuring sensorimotor adaptation, participants respond to a persistent sensory error by shifting behavior to oppose the error. This phenomenon has been measured in multiple motor tasks in which sensory feedback is experimentally altered to artificially introduce an error. Tasks involving multiple cycles of altered and unaltered feedback have been used in the arm reaching domain to understand the mechanisms of un-learning and re-learning a response to an error, but re-learning within a single session has not been studied in the domain of fundamental frequency (f0) control during speech.MethodsIn this study, participants responded to three alternating blocks of f0-shifted and unshifted auditory feedback during a single-word speech task.ResultsIt was found that on average, adaptation magnitude decreased in the second and third blocks of shifted feedback compared to the first. This illustrates an attenuation effect similar to that observed in studies of implicit learning in arm reaching tasks.DiscussionThese results support the understanding of f0 control as an implicit learning phenomenon and help place f0 control in the context of motor control in general.",

      "title": "Pattern-induced visual discomfort and its cumulative effects revealed by pupillary measures",
      "content": "IntroductionViewing repetitive striped patterns can induce pattern glare, experienced as visual discomfort (VD). While previous studies examined either pupillary responses or VD separately, few have investigated how they covary or evolve with repeated exposure. This study tested whether pupillary dynamics could serve as potential physiological indicator of individual visual sensitivity beyond subjective reports.MethodsAcross four experiments (preliminary: n = 97; main: n = 70 for spatial frequency, n = 46 for central field size, n = 36 for central blank, with partial overlap), we manipulated spatial frequency, central field size, and surround field size of square-wave gratings (0.5\u20133 s) while measuring both discomfort and pupil size.ResultsHigher spatial frequencies and larger pattern areas elicited stronger pupillary constriction and greater discomfort, whereas repeated exposures produced cumulative increases in discomfort and decreases in baseline pupil size, consistent with visual strain rather than adaptation. To assess the potential of pupillometry as an indicator of visual discomfort, we examined individual differences in the main spatial-frequency experiment (controlled viewing distance, n = 42). A paradoxical pattern emerged: within participants, stronger stimuli produced greater constriction, but individuals with higher overall discomfort showed weaker constriction and stronger late redilation. Similar dissociations between subjective sensitivity and pupillary responses have been noted in studies of light-induced discomfort, suggesting that related mechanisms may contribute, although their specific physiological basis remains unclear.DiscussionOverall, our findings clarify how pattern-induced discomfort evolves over time and across individuals and highlight pupillometry's potential as a sensitive, physiological tool for assessing visual sensitivity.",

      "title": "The association of hemoglobin levels and balance function in patients with stroke: a multicenter study in China",
      "content": "BackgroundBalance impairment following stroke is a leading cause of disability and falls. Hemoglobin (Hb) affects systemic and cerebral oxygen delivery and may influence neuromuscular function and post-stroke balance, but evidence from large multicenter clinical samples is limited. We investigated the association between hemoglobin concentration and balance performance in a Chinese multicenter cross-sectional study of stroke patients.MethodsWe studied 2,006 neuroimaging-confirmed stroke patients from 26 hospitals. Balance impairment was defined as BBS\u202f\u2264\u202f40. Admission Hb (g/dL) was analyzed per 1\u202fg/dL and by tertiles (<12.6\u202fg/dL, 12.6\u201314.0\u202fg/dL, \u226514.0\u202fg/dL). Multivariable logistic regression with sequential adjustment, restricted cubic splines, and prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses evaluated associations.ResultsBalance impairment occurred in 70.5% (1,414/2,006). Each 1\u202fg/dL higher Hb was associated with lower odds of impairment in unadjusted (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78\u20130.87; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and fully adjusted models (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83\u20130.96; p\u202f=\u202f0.002). This association remained robust after comprehensive adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, stroke characteristics, and lesion location factors. Compared with the lowest tertile, adjusted ORs were 0.72 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.99; p\u202f=\u202f0.042) for the middle tertile and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45\u20130.85; p\u202f=\u202f0.003) for the highest tertile. Spline analyses suggested a broadly linear inverse association; results were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity checks.ConclusionHigher admission hemoglobin was independently associated with better balance after stroke. Prospective studies should test whether Hb optimization improves rehabilitation outcomes.",
