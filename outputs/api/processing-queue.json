      "title": "VR-Assisted Guide Dog Training: A 360{\\deg} PanoHaptic System for Right-Hand Commands Analysis",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.24057v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents a VR-based guide dog training system designed to assist novice trainers in understanding guide dog behavior and issuing appropriate training commands. Guide dogs play a vital role in supporting independent mobility for visually impaired individuals, yet the limited number of skilled trainers restricts their availability. Training is highly demanding, requiring accurate observation of the dog's status and precise command issuance, especially through right-hand gestures. While the trainer's left hand holds the harness to perceive haptic cues, the right hand is used to indicate directions, maintain attention, and provide comfort, with motion patterns varying by scenario and the dog's progress. Currently, novices learn mainly by observing experts or watching videos, which lacks immersion and makes it difficult to adopt the trainer's perspective for understanding behavior or synchronizing command timing.\n  To address these limitations, the proposed system introduces a VR-based assistive platform integrating panoramic visuals and haptic feedback to create an immersive training environment. The visual module provides contextual guidance, including cues for command execution and real-time comparison of the user's posture with standard actions, while the haptic module delivers tactile feedback for command gestures. Users can re-experience training sessions across diverse scenarios and dog proficiency levels, allowing independent and repeated practice. By improving the timing, accuracy, and expressiveness of right-hand commands, the system aims to accelerate skill acquisition, enhance training quality, and mitigate the shortage of qualified trainers, ultimately increasing the availability of guide dogs for visually impaired individuals.",

      "title": "Understanding Reader Perception Shifts upon Disclosure of AI Authorship",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.24011v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As AI writing support becomes ubiquitous, how disclosing its use affects reader perception remains a critical, underexplored question. We conducted a study with 261 participants to examine how revealing varying levels of AI involvement shifts author impressions across six distinct communicative acts. Our analysis of 990 responses shows that disclosure generally erodes perceptions of trustworthiness, caring, competence, and likability, with the sharpest declines in social and interpersonal writing. A thematic analysis of participants' feedback links these negative shifts to a perceived loss of human sincerity, diminished author effort, and the contextual inappropriateness of AI. Conversely, we find that higher AI literacy mitigates these negative perceptions, leading to greater tolerance or even appreciation for AI use. Our results highlight the nuanced social dynamics of AI-mediated authorship and inform design implications for creating transparent, context-sensitive writing systems that better preserve trust and authenticity.",

      "title": "Modeling Object Attention in Mobile AR for Intrinsic Cognitive Security",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.24004v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study attention in mobile Augmented Reality (AR) using object recall as a proxy outcome. We observe that the ability to recall an object (physical or virtual) that was encountered in a mobile AR experience depends on many possible impact factors and attributes, with some objects being readily recalled while others are not, and some people recalling objects overall much better or worse than others. This opens up a potential cognitive attack in which adversaries might create conditions that make an AR user not recall certain potentially mission-critical objects. We explore whether a calibrated predictor of object recall can help shield against such cognitive attacks. We pool data from four mobile AR studies (with a total of 1,152 object recall probes) and fit a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) with formative Object, Scene, and User State composites predicting recall, also benchmarking against Random Forest and multilayer perceptron classifiers. PLS-SEM attains the best F1 score in three of four studies. Additionally, path estimates identify lighting, augmentation density, AR registration stability, cognitive load, and AR familiarity as primary drivers. The model outputs per-object recall probabilities that can drive interface adjustments when predicted recall falls. Overall, PLS-SEM provides competitive accuracy with interpretable levers for design and evaluation in mobile AR.",

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 176 publications across different application domains (e.g., healthcare, education, and entertainment). Using a four-dimensional coding framework (application, technical, evaluative, and ethical), we find (1) frequent use of pattern recognition and information extraction from multimodal sources, but limited support for adaptive, interactive reasoning; (2) a dominant 'modality-to-text' pipeline that privileges language over rich audiovisual cues, striping away nuanced social cues; (3) evaluation practices reliant on static benchmarks, with socially grounded, human-centered assessments rare; and (4) Ethical discussions focused mainly on legal and rights-related risks (e.g., privacy), leaving societal risks (e.g., deception) overlooked--or at best acknowledged but left unaddressed. We outline a research agenda for evaluating socially competent, ethically informed, and interaction-aware multi-modal systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.24070v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As generative AI becomes embedded in children's learning spaces, families face new challenges in guiding its use. Middle childhood (ages 7-13) is a critical stage where children seek autonomy even as parental influence remains strong. Using self-directed learning (SDL) as a lens, we examine how parents perceive and support children's developing AI literacy through focus groups with 13 parent-child pairs. Parents described evolving phases of engagement driven by screen time, self-motivation, and growing knowledge. While many framed AI primarily as a study tool, few considered its non-educational roles or risks, such as privacy and infrastructural embedding. Parents also noted gaps in their own AI understanding, often turning to joint exploration and engagement as a form of co-learning. Our findings reveal how families co-construct children's AI literacy, exposing tensions between practical expectations and critical literacies, and provide design implications that foster SDL while balancing autonomy and oversight.",

      "content": "Nociception -- the detection of harmful stimuli by the nervous system -- contributes to both rapid escape and long-term avoidance behaviors. Drosophila larvae detect damaging heat, mechanical, and chemical stimuli with specialized multidendritic (md) neurons, and these cells are among the only sensory neurons that survive metamorphosis. However, it remains unknown which somatosensory neurons contribute to nociception in adult flies. In an optogenetic screen, we found that abdominal md neurons were the only somatosensory class to induce rapid escape and sustained place avoidance. Calcium imaging from abdominal md axons revealed that they are activated by thermal nociceptive stimuli (>40 {degrees}C). Connectomic reconstruction showed that md axons form their strongest synaptic connections with ascending interneurons that project to the brain. Among these, we identified two classes of ascending neurons that mediate rapid escape responses and a third that supports sustained avoidance. Our findings reveal that adult Drosophila meet several core criteria commonly used to define pain: dedicated nociceptors, ascending pathways connecting peripheral sensors to integrative brain centers, and a capacity for sustained avoidance of noxious stimuli.",
