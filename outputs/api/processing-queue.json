      "title": "From generative AI to the brain: five takeaways",
      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "Structural connectome gradients and their relationship to IQ in childhood",
      "content": "The concept of connectome gradients, which represents the continuous spatial variation of brain connectivity, offers a robust framework for exploring the hierarchical organization of the cortex and its relationship with cognitive function. We hypothesize that structural gradients in frontal and parietal regions play a significant role in shaping individual cognitive abilities during early childhood. To evaluate this hypothesis, we identified macroscale structural connectome gradients in children aged 1\u20136 years, where the principal gradient exhibited a left-to-right axis, and the secondary gradient exhibited an anterior-to-posterior axis. Next, we employed machine learning approaches to predict the future cognitive outcomes assessed at ages 4, 6, and 8, specifically intelligence quotient (IQ), based on the structural connectome gradients measured at age 1. We achieved consistent and robust prediction results (mean Spearman's correlation > 0.25). The regional relevance maps highlighted regions in control network, and associated sensory processing networks. Our findings indicate that the structural connectome, which undergoes maturation during early childhood, plays a crucial role in the individual variability of IQ observed in early and middle childhood. Our approach underscores the utility of structural gradients as compact and interpretable representations of the brain's complex network architecture, effectively capturing individual differences that contribute to cognitive development.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding plays a critical role in brain\u2013computer interfaces but remains challenging due to large inter-subject variability and limited training data. Existing approaches often struggle with few-shot cross-subject adaptation, as they require either extensive fine-tuning or fail to capture individualized neural dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a Task-Conditioned Prompt Learning (TCPL), which integrates a Task-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module with a hybrid Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Transformer backbone under a meta-learning framework. Specifically, TCP encodes subject-specific variability as prompt tokens, TCN extracts local temporal patterns, Transformer captures global dependencies, and meta-learning enables rapid adaptation with minimal samples. The proposed TCPL model is validated on three widely used public datasets, GigaScience, Physionet, and BCI Competition IV 2a, demonstrating strong generalization and efficient adaptation across unseen subjects. These results highlight the feasibility of TCPL for practical few-shot EEG decoding and its potential to advance the development of personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

ASL-3+ models present a unique risk in their ability to uplift novice non-state actors, especially in the realm of biosecurity. Existing evaluation metrics, such as LAB-Bench, BioLP-bench, and WMDP, can reliably assess model uplift and domain knowledge. However, metrics that better contextualize \"real-world risks\" are needed to inform the safety case for LLMs, along with scalable, open-ended metrics to keep pace with their rapid advancements. To address both gaps, we introduce MOCET, an interpretable and doubly-scalable metric (automatable and open-ended) that can quantify real-world risks.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16814v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While recent research suggests Large Language Models match human creative performance in divergent thinking tasks, visual creativity remains underexplored. This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.",

In Graphic Design, integrating computational systems into co-creative workflows presents specific challenges, as it requires balancing scientific rigour with the subjective and visual nature of design practice. Following the PRISMA methodology, we identified 872 articles, resulting in a final corpus of 71 publications describing 68 unique systems. Based on this review, we introduce GRAPHIC (Guidelines for Reviewing Algorithmic Practices in Human-centred Design and Interaction for Creativity), a framework for analysing AI-based systems applied to Graphic Design. Its goal is to understand how current systems support human-AI collaboration in the Graphic Design discipline. The framework comprises main dimensions, which our analysis revealed to be essential across diverse system types: (1) Collaborative Panorama, (2) Processes and Modalities, and (3) Graphic Design Principles. Its application revealed research gaps, including the need to balance initiative and control between agents, improve communication through explainable interaction models, and promote systems that support transformational creativity grounded in core design principles.",

They afford unique real-time lenses into remote sites for viewers' synchronous and collective engagement. Foregrounding its lack of dynamism and interactivity, we aim to maximize the potential of SLS by making it interactive. Namely MRSLS, we overlaid plain SLS with interactive Mixed Reality content that matches the site's geographical structures and local cultural backgrounds. We further highlight the substantial benefit of MRSLS to cultural heritage site interactions, and we demonstrate this design proposal with an MRSLS prototype at a UNESCO-listed heritage site in China. The design process includes an interview (N=6) to pinpoint local scenery and culture, as well as two iterative design studies (N=15, 14). A mixed-methods, between-subjects study (N=43, 37) shows that MRSLS affords immersive scenery appreciation, effective cultural imprints, and vivid shared experience. With its balance between cultural, participatory, and authentic attributes, we appeal for more HCI attention to (MR)SLS as an under-explored design space.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.16990v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is critical for human-computer interaction but faces challenges when the modalities are incomplete or missing. Existing methods often assume pre-defined missing modalities or fixed missing rates, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this challenge, we propose Senti-iFusion, an integrity-centered hierarchical fusion framework capable of handling both inter- and intra-modality missingness simultaneously. It comprises three hierarchical components: Integrity Estimation, Integrity-weighted Completion, and Integrity-guided Fusion. First, the Integrity Estimation module predicts the completeness of each modality and mitigates the noise caused by incomplete data. Second, the Integrity-weighted Cross-modal Completion module employs a novel weighting mechanism to disentangle consistent semantic structures from modality-specific representations, enabling the precise recovery of sentiment-related features across language, acoustic, and visual modalities. To ensure consistency in reconstruction, a dual-depth validation with semantic- and feature-level losses ensures consistent reconstruction at both fine-grained (low-level) and semantic (high-level) scales. Finally, the Integrity-guided Adaptive Fusion mechanism dynamically selects the dominant modality for attention-based fusion, ensuring that the most reliable modality, based on completeness and quality, contributes more significantly to the final prediction. Senti-iFusion employs a progressive training approach to ensure stable convergence. Experimental results on popular MSA datasets demonstrate that Senti-iFusion outperforms existing methods, particularly in fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks. The code and our proposed Senti-iFusion model will be publicly available.",

      "title": "Emerging technologies and neuroscience-based approaches in dyslexia: a narrative review toward integrative and personalized solutions",
      "content": "BackgroundDevelopmental dyslexia is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs reading ability despite adequate intelligence and education, affecting up to 17% of children worldwide. Advances in neuroscience have revealed complex mechanisms involving phonological, visual, and temporal processing, with cross-linguistic variability. At the same time, technological innovation is driving a shift toward AI-powered diagnostics, immersive learning tools, and neurostimulation-based interventions.MethodsThis narrative review synthesizes evidence from recent research published between 2015 and 2025, focusing on four thematic areas: (1) neurobiological underpinnings of dyslexia, (2) diagnostic innovations using AI and eye- or handwriting-based deep learning, (3) neurostimulation and immersive VR/AR interventions, and (4) policy, equity, and ethical considerations. Studies were identified through major academic databases and thematically analyzed to highlight trends, strengths, and limitations.ResultsAI-based diagnostic tools using eye-tracking and handwriting features have achieved reported accuracies exceeding 80% in multiple pilot studies. VR/game-based programs and neurostimulation interventions (TMS, tDCS) have shown promising short-term effects on reading fluency and phonological processing, though evidence for long-term literacy transfer remains limited. Across studies, methodological heterogeneity and small sample sizes constrain generalizability. Significant disparities in access persist across socioeconomic, linguistic, and geographic contexts.ConclusionsWhile these technologies offer promising avenues for more personalized and scalable dyslexia care, their integration must be accompanied by stronger evidence, ethical safeguards, and equity-focused policies. Technology should augment, not replace, human interaction in inclusive education. Future research should prioritize larger trials, cross-linguistic validation, and sustainable implementation strategies.",

      "title": "Loss of Nocturnin increases neuronal viability in oxidative stress conditions",
      "content": "Oxidative stress, characterized by an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants, plays a critical role in neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) and is strongly associated with neuronal cell death. Nocturnin was identified as a NADP(H) phosphatase and key regulator of oxidative stress. NADPH serves as a crucial co-factor for enzymes which regenerate antioxidants, and downregulation of its levels increases sensitivity to oxidative stress mediated neurodegeneration. In this study, we examined how the loss of Nocturnin impacts redox homeostasis and neuronal survival in Cath.a-differentiated (CAD) cells and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a mutant alpha-synuclein overexpression PD mouse model (DASYN53). Here we demonstrate that loss of Nocturnin increases CAD cell viability by increasing total glutathione levels, boosting metabolites involved in antioxidant defense, and reducing oxidative damage. Additionally, Nocturnin deletion in DASYN53 mice promotes midbrain dopaminergic neuron survival. These findings suggest that the loss of Nocturnin protects neurons from oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant defense, which rescues neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons.",
