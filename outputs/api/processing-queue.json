      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "title": "Neurodegeneration in the olfactory system in Niemann Pick type C1 disease",
      "content": "Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder linked to defective cholesterol biosynthesis and altered lipid regulation. In patients, the most common variant in the Npc1 gene is a missense mutation that leads to a misfolded and non-functional NPC1 protein. We used a mouse model carrying this mutation (I1061T, Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso) to investigate the olfactory system since olfaction is often negatively impacted in many neurodegenerative disorders, with olfactory decline frequently preceding other neurodegenerative symptoms. We characterized cell types in the olfactory epithelium (OE) in wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice to analyze neurodegeneration at two time points, namely 36 and 60 days after birth. In homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice the density of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) at 36 days after birth is decreased compared to wild type and heterozygous mice while the density of immature OSNs and the stem cell niche seems to not be affected. In the OE of the homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice we found an increased density of apoptotic cells and clear sign of neuroinflammation in macrophage/microglia infiltrating the OE. We analyzed the lipid profile of OE by positive MALDI-TOF and found increased markers of neuroinflammation homozygous Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice. These structural changes affected the functionality of the OE since we found reduced odorant responses in Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso mice compared to wild type. Additionally, our olfactory behavioral tests revealed deficits in odor-guided food-seeking tests in Npc1tm(I1061T)Dso but not in the wild type and heterozygous mice. We also analyzed the olfactory abilities of a family of three with the parents carrying two different mutations of the Npc1 gene, with the child carrying both mutations and being diagnosed with NPC1 disease. Using the Sniffin Sticks olfactory test, we found that all three were hyposmic with the child having severe hyposmia. Our work extensively characterized the OE structurally and functionally proposing it as a sentinel to monitor disease progression. We are the first to show that NPC1 patients are affected by severe hyposmia and that heterozygous parents could be monitored for olfactory abilities since it could be a biomarker for future neurological disorders.",

      "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",

      "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Python's native logging module is just fine but modern options like Loguru and Structlog are eye-catching. As someone who wants to use the best tooling so that I can make my life easy, I agonized over choosing one.. perhaps a little too much (I'd rather expend calories now rather than being in production hell and trying to wrangle logs).</p> <p>I've boiled down what I've learnt to the following:</p> <ul> <li>Read some good advice here on <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a> to switch to a third party library only when you find/need something that the native libraries can't do - this basically holds true.</li> <li>Loguru's (most popular 3rd party library) value prop (zero config, dev ex prioritized) in the age of AI coding is much less appealing. AI can handle writing config boiler plate with the native logging module</li> <li>What kills loguru is that it isnt opentelemetry compatible. Meaning if you are using it for a production or production intent codebase, loguru really shouldnt be an option. </li> <li>Structlog feels like a more powerful and featured option but this brings with it the need to learn, understand a new system. Plus it still needs a custom &quot;processor&quot; to integrate with OTEL. </li> <li>Structlog's biggest value prop - structured logging - is also now trivial through native logging with AI writing the JSON formatter classes.</li> </ul> <p>So my recommendation is:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hobby/Personal projects:</strong> where you want to spend the least amount of effort on logging, use loguru. An ideal <code>print()</code> replacement</li> <li><strong>Production projects:</strong> Use native logging but ensure you do structured outputs - offload to AI to take care of this - its well within its wheelhouse and is capable of doing a solid job. </li> <li>Use structlog only if and when you need complex processing logic on your logs. </li> </ul> <p>The one trade off is that loguru/structlog have good exception/stack trace handling capabilities built in. With native logging, you'll need to write more code and for this case, AI coding may get hairy.</p> <p>P.S: Im yet to integrate into a log aggregation service (aiming at Signoz) so we'll have to wait and see how this decision pays off.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rm-rf-rm\"> /u/rm-rf-rm </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p6qy1e/spent_a_bunch_of_time_choosing_between_loguru/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p6qy1e/spent_a_bunch_of_time_choosing_between_loguru/\">[comments]</a></span>",
