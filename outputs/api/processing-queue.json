      "content": "Background: Depression is biologically heterogeneous, and first-episode depression (FED) carries a high risk of recurrence that is poorly captured by symptom-based assessment. Early identification of patients likely to relapse, as well as reliable identification of those unlikely to relapse, is needed to support personalized intervention and efficient allocation of care. Methods: We developed a neurocomputational framework to infer recurrence risk from resting-state fMRI functional connectivity. The framework combines a Convolutional Filtering Autoencoder (CFAE) with a k-medoids clustering algorithm (FED-kMC) to derive neurofunctional FED subtypes, followed by a Manifold Sheaves-based Ensemble Support Vector Machine (MST-LVSVM) to estimate individual-level recurrence risk and define an interpretable decision boundary. Circuit-level analyses were then used to localize connectivity pathways associated with high relapse risk. Results: The framework identified two neurofunctionally distinct FED subtypes with divergent recurrence trajectories and achieved an external validation accuracy of 82.61% for recurrence risk prediction. Circuit analyses highlighted dysfunction within the Medial Superior Frontal Gyrus--Hippocampus and Angular Gyrus--Precuneus pathways as neural correlates of high relapse risk, together with a decision boundary enabling early-stage risk stratification. Conclusions: Integrating connectome-derived, circuit-level information with subtype-aware machine learning may support proactive identification of FED patients at elevated recurrence risk and facilitate targeted early interventions, bridging connectome-level analysis and clinical decision-making.",

      "title": "Dynamical A\u03b2-Tau-Neurodegeneration Model Predicts Alzheimer's Disease Mechanisms and Biomarker Progression",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease is characterised by the pathological interaction of two proteins, amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau, which collectively drive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The progression of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration biomarkers is captured by the ATN framework, which is a powerful tool for disease classification. However, since the ATN framework is mainly descriptive, it cannot quantify or predict relationships between biomarkers over time. We address this limitation by introducing a dynamical ATN (dATN) model that mechanistically simulates the spatiotemporal progression of A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration. The dATN model integrates mechanisms of prion-like protein aggregation of A{beta} and tau, network-based tau propagation, A{beta}-driven catalysis of tau progression, and tau-driven neurodegeneration. We calibrated the model using multimodal longitudinal imaging data from both the ADNI and BioFINDER-2 cohorts and show that it accurately fits longitudinal regional A{beta}, tau, and neurodegeneration data. Using the dATN model, we show that A{beta}-induced effects predict Braak-like cortical tau progression, that the spatial colocalisation of A{beta} and tau is a crucial biomarker of disease acceleration, and that tau-driven atrophy strongly correlates with observed neurodegeneration. Furthermore, by integrating the disease progression model with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic simulations, we present a powerful tool that facilitates regional evaluation of therapeutic strategies targeting A{beta}, identification of critical intervention windows, and prediction of heterogeneous treatment effects across brain regions. This framework unifies mechanistic understanding with clinical imaging biomarkers, offering a quantitative approach for forecasting disease progression, testing mechanistic hypotheses, and optimising personalised treatment strategies in AD.",

      "title": "Altered theta distribution and coherence during set-shifting in older age",
      "content": "Cognitive flexibility is an executive function that enables adapting behaviour to a changing environment and is thus critical for daily life. The degree of its preservation upon healthy aging and the neural mechanisms underlying it are still a matter of debate. To investigate the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive flexibility in older age, we measured cognitive flexibility in 99 young (24.75 {+/-} 4.45 years) and 83 older adults (69.19 {+/-} 6.25) using electroencephalography (EEG). Compared to young adults, older adults showed a more conservative response pattern with longer reaction times, but lower error rates (speed-accuracy tradeoff). In the EEG, both age groups exhibited increased theta-power during set-shifting, with a fronto-central peak in the young, but a more fronto-lateral topography in older adults. Importantly, both groups displayed increases in theta coherence and global efficiency during set-shifting, but coherence modulations were restricted in frontocentral areas in the young but were diminished and distributed across the scalp in the older. Better set-shifting performance was most strongly associated with high coherence and global efficiency irrespective of age group. These results point to an age-related change of cortical processing underlying cognitive flexibility which involves the employment of more distributed neural resources for successful task completion.",
