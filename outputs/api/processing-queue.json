      "title": "Dynamic graph representation of EEG signals for speech imagery recognition",
      "content": "Objective. Speech imagery recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an emerging challenge in brain-computer interfaces, and has important applications, such as in the interaction with locked-in patients. In this work, we use graph signal processing for developing a more effective representation of EEG signals in speech imagery recognition. Approach. We propose a dynamic graph representation that uses multiple graphs constructed based on the time-varying correlations between EEG channels. Our methodology is particularly suitable for signals that exhibit fluctuating correlations, which cannot be adequately modeled through a static (single graph) model. The resultant representation provides graph frequency features that compactly capture the spatial patterns of the underlying multidimensional EEG signal as well as the evolution of spatial relationships over time. These dynamic graph features are fed into an attention-based long short-term memory network for speech imagery recognition. A novel EEG data augmentation method is also proposed for improving training robustness. Main results. Experimental evaluation using a range of experiments shows that the proposed dynamic graph features are more effective than conventional time-frequency features for speech imagery recognition. The overall system outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, yielding accuracy gains of up to 10%. Significance. The dynamic graph representation captures time-varying spatial relationships in EEG signals, overcoming limitations of static graph models and conventional feature extraction. Combined with data augmentation and attention-based classification, it demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in speech imagery recognition.",

      "content": "Objective. Advances in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have rapidly accelerated in the last decade that promises to improve the quality of life of patients with communications, sensory, and motor control disabilities. Approach. In this Perspective, we quantify the extent and nature of scientific convergence across 21 research groups conducting iBCI clinical trials worldwide. Using medical subject headers and Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomies, we analyze topical and disciplinary integration within 161 publications from 1998\u20132023 to assess how deeply team composition aligns with research themes and translational impact. Main Results. Our findings indicate uneven patterns of convergence, with many teams combining engineering and clinical expertise yet omitting ethical, legal, and social dimensions. This represents what we term short-cut convergence. Significance. We propose an operational definition of this phenomenon and identify practical steps for researchers and funders to strengthen full convergence to accelerate iBCI translation and implementation.",

      "title": "Electrical characterization and accelerated aging of amorphous silicon carbide implantable encapsulation",
      "content": "Objective. Chronically implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used for stimulating and recording neural activity in research and clinical settings. However, their reliability can be compromised by insufficient encapsulation stability. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), a chemically stable and biocompatible material, has emerged as a potential thin-film encapsulation for MEAs. We aimed to evaluate thin-film a-SiC encapsulation using electrical-accelerated aging (EAA) and to demonstrate a methodology for obtaining acceleration factors for EAA by Weibull analysis. Approach. Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) encapsulated with a-SiC were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped-voltage protocols to measure leakage currents in buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. EAA employed incrementally increasing voltage biases over time to induce degradation and reveal failure mechanisms. Main results. IDEs exhibited a significant change in electrical behavior on exposure to saline, with failure initiating at specific voltages and accompanied by gas evolution at defect sites. Incremental voltage biasing revealed a capacitive-to-faradaic transition in leakage current response that was used as a failure criterion. Significance. Acceleration factors for voltage-driven accelerated aging of a-SiC thin-film encapsulation can be obtained by Weibull analysis using a mechanistic failure criterion. Breakdown occurs at processing-related defects in the a-SiC. This study demonstrates the use of EAA for evaluating failure in a-SiC thin-film encapsulation used in implantable MEAs. EAA is broadly applicable to thin-film MEAs and provides a highly relevant method of predicting implanted lifetimes of bioelectronics.",

      "title": "sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing in a large adult and pediatric cohort",
      "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

      "title": "The Agentic Leash: Extracting Causal Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with LLMs",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.00097v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.",

While NLP based autograding systems for open-ended response questions have been found to be beneficial for providing immediate feedback, autograders are not always liked, understood, or trusted by students. Our research tested the effect of transparency on students' attitudes towards autograders. Transparent autograders increased students' perceptions of autograder accuracy and willingness to discuss autograders in survey comments, but did not improve other related attitudes -- such as willingness to be graded by them on a test -- relative to the control without transparency. However, this lack of impact may be due to higher measured student trust towards autograders in this study than in prior work in the field. We briefly discuss possible reasons for this trend.",

      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>**What My Project Does** </p> <p>A terminal\u2011based TUI that monitors the process tree (parent, CPU, memory, I/O) and feeds this context to a local LLM (Llama 3 via Ollama or Groq). The model classifies each process as \u201cCritical\u201d or \u201cBloatware\u201d. For bloatware it prints a short roast and offers to kill it. BrainKernel (<a href=\"https://github.com/mprajyothreddy/brainkernel\">https://github.com/mprajyothreddy/brainkernel</a>) replaces the usual CPU % sorting with \u201cvibe\u2011based\u201d sorting, shows a live\u2011updating table while staying under 1 % CPU, and can auto\u2011suspend distraction apps (e.g., Steam, games) when they exceed a user\u2011defined threshold. </p> <p>**Target Audience** </p> <p>- Developers who are tired of manually hunting down unknown processes. </p> <p>- Linux and Windows users who want a task manager that explains what a process is doing. </p> <p>- Anyone experimenting with local edge AI integrated into the OS loop. </p> <p>**Comparison** </p> <p>- **vs htop/top:** htop is faster and lighter but assumes you know every process name. BrainKernel adds semantic classification, giving meaning to each PID. </p> <p>- **vs Windows Task Manager:** Windows\u2019 manager is GUI\u2011centric and lacks process explanations. BrainKernel is keyboard\u2011centric, can \u201croast\u201d bloatware for entertainment, and includes a focus/governor mode that can automatically suspend or kill distracting applications.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Turbulent-Spark6633\"> /u/Turbulent-Spark6633 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3oxk3/i_built_a_tui_process_manager_that_uses_a_local/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q3oxk3/i_built_a_tui_process_manager_that_uses_a_local/\">[comments]</a></span>",
