      "title": "A systematic review of the effects of brain-computer interface on lower limb motor function, balance function, and activities of daily living in stroke patients",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the effects of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology on lower limb motor function, balance function, and activities of daily living in stroke patients.MethodsThis study followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases, with an additional manual search. The search period was from database inception to March 2024. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the studies, the GRADE system was applied to evaluate the evidence quality for outcome measures, and Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 17.0 software.ResultsThe systematic review included nine studies. The methodological quality, assessed using the PEDro scale, yielded an average score of 6.9, which corresponds to a moderate-to-low certainty of evidence. The Meta-analysis showed that BCI technology significantly improved lower limb motor function (MD\u202f=\u202f3.52, 95% CI [2.03, 5.00], p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and activities of daily living (MD\u202f=\u202f6.08, 95% CI [1.81, 10.35], p\u202f=\u202f0.01), but had no significant effect on balance function (MD\u202f=\u202f4.82, 95% CI [\u22121.53, 11.16], p\u202f=\u202f0.14). Subgroup analysis showed that the effect size in the acute and subacute phases was 3.89, and in the recovery phase, it was 3.12, both of which were statistically significant. In terms of intervention methods, the effect size for MI-BCI was 2.73, and for BCI-Robot, it was 4.60, both statistically significant. Regarding intervention dosage, the effect size for 2.5\u201310\u202fh was 2.60, and for 12\u201320\u202fh, it was 5.46, both statistically significant.ConclusionCurrent evidence suggests that BCI-based interventions have a beneficial effect on lower limb motor function and activities of daily living in stroke patients. Interventions initiated during the acute or subacute phase, with a total dose exceeding 12\u202fh, appear to be associated with superior outcomes. However, the certainty of this evidence is moderate to low, necessitating further validation. Future research should prioritize large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials to definitively establish the efficacy of BCI technology and elucidate its optimal implementation protocols.",

      "title": "A knowledge-driven framework for surgical safety check integration using speech recognition and speaker verification",
      "content": "BackgroundThe WHO Surgical Safety Checklist reduces preventable errors, but real operating rooms are characterized by overlapping speech, high ambient noise, similar vocalizations, uncertain speaker identity, and occasional omission of checklist items. ASR-only systems that ignore identity constraints and semantic\u2013temporal structure are therefore prone to misrecognition and incorrect verification.MethodWe design an integrated verification framework that couples automatic speech recognition and speaker verification (ASR\u202f+\u202fSV) with a knowledge-driven rule engine derived from the WHO checklist. Multichannel audio is processed by a Conformer-based ASR module and an ECAPA-TDNN speaker verification model, after which a rule layer enforces consistency across the semantic content, speaker role, and checklist phase using an explicit ontology and conflict-resolution rules. The system generates real-time prompts in four states (\u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfault,\u201d \u201calarm,\u201d \u201cuncertain\u201d). Performance is evaluated primarily in high-fidelity simulated operating-room scenarios with controlled noise levels, speaking distances, and multi-speaker interactions, using word error rate (WER), equal error rate (EER), checklist verification accuracy, and alarm rate. Three configurations are compared on the same held-out sessions\u2014\u201cASR-only,\u201d \u201cASR\u202f+\u202fSV,\u201d and the full knowledge-driven method\u2014and ablation experiments isolate the contribution of the rule layer.ResultsUnder medium-to-high noise and multi-speaker interference, the full framework reduced WER from 18.7% to approximately 13.5% and achieved an EER of about 3.1% relative to the ASR-only baseline. Checklist verification accuracy reached 93.8%, while the alarm rate decreased to roughly 2.7%. The knowledge layer corrected errors arising from homophones, accent drift, and role confusion by constraining \u201crole\u2013semantics\u2013process\u201d relations, and maintained robust performance at speaking distances up to 1.5\u202fm and background noise of 60\u202fdB. Residual failures were mainly associated with extreme speech overlap and unseen vocabulary, suggesting that lexicon adaptation and speech separation will be necessary for further gains.ConclusionThe proposed knowledge-driven ASR\u202f+\u202fSV framework jointly addresses semantic correctness and speaker identity while remaining interpretable, auditable, and suitable for embedded deployment. It provides a technical foundation for \u201ctime-out\u201d and \u201coperation review\u201d functions in intelligent operating rooms. Because the present validation is based largely on simulated scenarios with limited real-world testing and no formal user or ethical evaluation, future work will focus on clinical pilot studies, integration with electronic medical records and multimodal OR data, and a deeper analysis of privacy, accountability, and workflow acceptance.",

      "title": "Computational modeling of resistance to hormone-mediated remission in childhood absence epilepsy",
      "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",

      "content": "Introduction and aimTechnological advancements in neuroscience have transformed our understanding of the processes underlying behavior and cognition. The study aims to investigate the changes in functional brain cognitive networks activated by 3DVR haptic-based simulation training in endodontics.Materials and methodsFifteen dental students (7 females and 8 males), mean age 21.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5\u202fyears, trained for the first time with a 3DVR-haptic simulator in April 2025, participated in the study. The one-group pretest\u2013postest interventional design was approved by the Ethics Committee of MU\u2013Plovdiv. Before and after a one-hour VR-endodontic access practice, we measured connectivity changes in the 49 Brodmann fields using swLORETA qEEG. Data were standardized using an age-stratified normative base through Z-score calculations. The qEEG recordings were processed by Neuroguide 3.3.7 and statistically analyzed with Navistat, p\u202f<\u202f0.05. To control the cognitive effects the participants completed a classic neuropsychological test for assessing executive functions before and after VR training: the Trail Making Test (TMT) Part A and Part B.ResultsThe most significant changes in brain activity were observed in the beta frequency range (18\u201324\u202fHz), primarily in the left frontal dorsolateral area, and the left insula and hippocampus. A significant change in activity was found in the mediobasal temporal cortex on both the left and right sides. According to connectomics, the most substantial changes were observed in the structures of 6, 7 and 8 ICN. The TMT data showed significant difference in records of the average time, difference and ratio scores before and after training in VR (p <\u202f0.05).Conclusion3DVR-haptic simulation training in endodontic actively engages cognitive modalities and brain structers related to executive functions, visuospatial sense, attention, and working memory, resilience to stress, and the need for reward. Objective electrophysiological changes correlate with improvements in neuropsychological performance TMT. Despite the limitations of this study, we argue that swLORETA qEEG method is a novel objective approach with a promising potential for validation the effects of 3DVR-haptic simulation training on cognitive functions, offering better temporal resolution compared to fMRI, along with lower costs and safety.",

      "title": "Beyond sex: the effects of testosterone on visuomotor performance in men and women",
      "content": "IntroductionThe ability to perform visually-guided motor tasks requires the transformation of visual information into programmed motor outputs. When the guiding visual information does not align spatially with the motor output, the brain processes rules to integrate somatosensory information into an appropriate motor response. Performance on such rule-based, \u201ccognitive-motor integration\u201d (CMI) tasks has been shown to be affected by sex, age, and in several neurologic conditions. The present study sought to (1) expand on these findings by examining whether such performance differences are related to levels of sex steroid hormones, and (2) characterize the relationship between hormone levels and any structural differences in brain regions responsible for complex motor control.MethodsThirty-six healthy individuals (18 females) underwent MRI scanning to acquire anatomical brain images. They performed two touchscreen-based eye\u2013hand coordination tasks, including a standard direct interaction task and one which involved CMI; target location and motor action were dissociated in the CMI task. Saliva samples collected on the day of testing were used to determine estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone levels.ResultsMultiple regression analyses revealed age to be a small but significant predictors of performance in a CMI condition with visual feedback reversal. We found that after accounting for this age effect, testosterone was a significant predictor of CMI performance in this group. We also observed that the relationship between testosterone levels and complex performance was related to grey matter thickness and volume in visuomotor control regions.ConclusionThese data suggest that underlying brain networks controlling simultaneous thought and action may differ as a function of sex steroid hormone concentrations, and that small performance declines emerge in the working-age years.",

      "title": "Domain-specific cognitive screening in acute first-ever stroke: a comparative study of the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) and ACE-III",
      "content": "IntroductionPost-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) is common and often under-recognized, particularly in the acute phase. Most cognitive screening tools provide only a global score, overlooking domain-specific deficits that influence functional recovery. The Addenbrooke\u2019s Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) is a comprehensive cognitive test whose utility for acute stroke patients remains under-studied. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the ACE-III against the stroke-specific Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS) in detecting PSCI following first-ever stroke in the acute period.MethodsPatients with first-ever stroke and no history of cognitive impairment were prospectively assessed within seven days of onset using both the OCS and ACE-III. PSCI was defined by impairment in one or more cognitive domains on the OCS. The discriminatory capacity of the ACE-III for detecting PSCI was examined, and associations between specific cognitive deficits and functional dependence were analyzed.ResultsThe OCS detected PSCI in 70% of the 30 patients that were recruited. The ACE-III demonstrated good discriminatory capacity (AUC = 0.897); however, it failed to detect PSCI in five patients identified by the OCS, and misclassified two aphasic but cognitively intact patients as impaired. Two patients classified as impaired on ACE-III were deemed cognitively intact by OCS, underscoring its limitations in stroke populations. Standard and stroke-specific ACE-III cut-offs demonstrated suboptimal accuracy for acute screening.ConclusionWhile ACE-III performs well at the group level, it may miss relevant cognitive impairment in the acute stroke setting. Domain-based, stroke-specific tools such as the OCS more reliably detect deficits and may offer greater clinical utility for early cognitive profiling and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Brain neural mechanisms underlying VR enhanced aerobic exercise for mood enhancement in depressed adolescents",
      "content": "IntroductionTo compare the immediate effects of a single bout of virtual reality (VR) aerobic exercise versus traditional aerobic exercise on depressive mood in middle-school students and to explore the underlying Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstate and power-spectrum mechanisms.MethodsForty middle-school students were classified into depressed and healthy groups based on the PHQ-9 and completed 15 min of moderate-intensity conventional cycling and VR cycling in a crossover design. Mood was assessed with the Brief Mood Scale (BFS) before and after each intervention, and resting-state EEG was recorded. EEG signals were processed using power spectrum analysis and microstate analysis, and correlation analysis was conducted between BFS questionnaire scores and microstate parameters.ResultsBoth interventions significantly increased vigor and pleasure while reducing depression and lethargy (p < 0.001); VR was superior to traditional cycling in improving vigor, depression, and lethargy (p < 0.01). At baseline, the depressed group showed elevated occurrence and contribution of microstate C with abnormal centroids. After exercise, microstate distributions normalized in both groups; VR specifically reduced microstate C occurrence (p < 0.05), prolonged microstate D duration (p < 0.05), and enhanced B \u2192 C and D \u2192 B transitions (p < 0.05). Post-VR B \u2192 C transition rate correlated negatively with depression (r = \u22120.462), whereas microstate D occurrence correlated positively with pleasure (r = 0.450). Relative theta, alpha, and beta power decreased after exercise (p < 0.01), without additional VR-mediated power-spectrum gains.ConclusionA single bout of VR-assisted aerobic exercise more effectively enhances immediate mood in middle-school students with depressive symptoms than traditional cycling, likely owing to stronger modulation of microstate dynamics linked to emotion and attention networks and of oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands.",

      "title": "Case Report: Prolonged DAWS in an RLS patient under severe relational stress",
      "content": "BackgroundDopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS) is a severe condition reported primarily in Parkinson's disease (PD) but increasingly recognized in restless legs syndrome (RLS). While DAWS is classically associated with high-dose dopamine agonists (DAs) in Parkinson's disease, it has also been reported in RLS patients treated with low-dose therapy (\u2264 0.75 mg pramipexole equivalent), although such cases remain rare. While direct evidence is lacking, psychological and relational stressors, in conjunction with prior medication adjustments, could plausibly modulate DAWS severity through a mechanism akin to kindling.Case presentationWe describe the case of a 51-year-old male who developed severe DAWS after withdrawing from low-dose pramipexole (0.26 mg) prescribed for RLS. A 6-month venlafaxine taper, completed 2 weeks before DA tapering, may have increased neurochemical vulnerability. Initial dose reduction caused akathisia, tremors, panic attacks, RLS worsening, and depressive symptoms. After brief reinstatement, abrupt cessation triggered painful electric-like sensations in the lower back and emotional collapse. The patient was transitioned to rotigotine (2 mg/day), together with other psychotropic medications, which provided partial and temporary relief. Symptoms relapsed during tapering, with marked worsening occurring in parallel with episodes of severe relational stress within a close personal connection. Clinical assessments explored these interactions as potential psychological stressors, as reported by the patient. Given the temporal association between these stressors and symptom relapses, relational factors may have contributed to the severity and recurrence of DAWS episodes. At 13 months after complete DA discontinuation, the patient has regained nearly full functionality, although episodes of marked fatigue and significant bedtime RLS persists.Discussion and conclusionThis case illustrates that DAWS can occur in RLS patients even at low DA doses, with atypical symptoms possibly involving autonomic and central sensitization. Relational stress may significantly exacerbate symptom severity, potentially leading to profound neurological destabilization through mechanisms such as cross-system hypersensitivity or a kindling-like process, as suggested by existing literature. This factor may need to be systematically assessed in DAWS management. As a rare patient-authored account, this report contributes to the understanding of DAWS in non-PD populations and highlights the need for longitudinal research to guide safer withdrawal protocols and integrated care.",

      "title": "The correlation between brain structure, function, and cognitive changes in patients with active-stage ulcerative colitis",
      "content": "BackgroundPatients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) frequently exhibit emotional disturbances and cognitive deficits. However, the neurobiological basis of these manifestations remains poorly understood. This study investigates neurostructural and functional alterations in UC patients using multimodal MRI to identify potential neural correlates.MethodsWe enrolled 45 active-stage UC patients and 48 healthy controls, all of whom underwent structural MRI, resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), neurocognitive testing, and clinical assessments. Regional neural activity was evaluated using fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), while gray matter volume (GMV) was analyzed to assess structural differences. Brain regions showing significant abnormalities were further examined for correlations with cognitive performance and clinical scale results.ResultsCompared to the healthy control group, the UC patient group exhibited higher scores in PSQI, PSS, SAS, and SDS. Furthermore, the UC patient group displayed varying degrees of impairment in attention, working memory, and executive function. The GMV of the bilateral thalamus in UC patients decreased, while the fALFF values in bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and left lingual gyrus increased. Conversely, the fALFF values in multiple brain regions, including bilateral frontal lobes, the right temporal lobe, and the right inferior parietal lobule, were decreased. Multiple brain regions with reduced activity in the bilateral frontal lobes are closely related to emotions and executive control, while the increased activity in the bilateral PCG is strongly correlated with stress and anxiety. The reduction GMV in bilateral thalamic is associated with working memory and attention.ConclusionCognitive impairment and emotional abnormalities in UC are associated with the functional activity and structure of multiple brain regions, particularly in the bilateral frontal lobes, PCG and thalamus. These findings provide potential neuroimaging evidence for the activation of the gut-brain axis due to chronic inflammation, and that certain brain regions may be considered as key targets for predicting cognitive impairment for UC patients.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "This study investigates the integration of augmented reality (AR) teaching environments with multimodal physiological monitoring for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. We collected EEG, ECG, and eye-tracking data from 115 children (ASD n =\u202f45, ADHD n =\u202f38, SLD n =\u202f32) during AR-enhanced learning tasks. The multimodal fusion approach achieved 89.3% classification accuracy in identifying disorder-specific patterns. Key biomarkers included frontal theta power variations (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), heart rate variability indices (LF/HF ratio), and fixation duration patterns. AR environments reduced cognitive load by 27% compared to traditional settings while maintaining engagement levels. Personalized intervention based on real-time physiological feedback improved attention performance by 31.2% and social interaction scores by 24.8% over 12\u202fmonths. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of combining AR technology with physiological monitoring for adaptive special education.",

      "content": "BackgroundEmerging evidence indicates that rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs)\u2014including ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics- may affect myelin homeostasis, aside from producing fast-onset, sustained improvements in several psychiatric disorders.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Europe PMC, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and Google Scholar was conducted up to October 2025 for studies examining the effects of RAADs on myelination and oligodendrocyte biology, as well as associated molecular and cellular mechanisms.Main bodyForty-one studies met the inclusion criteria: 12 in humans, 21 in animals, 7 in vitro, and one computational/theoretical. Thirty studies investigated ketamine and 11 serotonergic RAADs. Across models, RAADs modulate myelination in a dose- and exposure-dependent manner: therapeutic doses generally promote myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte maturation, while high or repeated doses, or neonatal exposure, can disrupt myelin structure and function, impair oligodendrocyte viability, and produce cognitive, affective, and neurotoxic side effects.ConclusionMyelin regulation may represent a component of RAAD action, indicating that these agents could influence myelin biology. Further research is required to clarify the mechanisms underlying these effects, their potential implications for therapies aimed at preserving or restoring myelin integrity, and potential side effects. Their dose-dependent effects highlight the need for careful consideration of dosing and treatment duration.",

      "content": "The healthcare field increasingly relies on autonomous systems for the detection and analysis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) to minimize diagnostic delays, resource burdens, reduce the progression of disability, and enhance clinical decision-making efficiency. Such systems ensure accurate and timely treatment, ultimately improved patient outcomes. In this study, a hybrid framework combining deep learning-based feature extraction, metaheuristic feature selection, and machine learning (ML) classifiers is proposed for accurate MS classification. All MRI images were preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), resizing, and normalization to enhance contrast and standardize the input dimensions. Deep features were extracted using the pretrained VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN), in which the fully connected layers were removed, and the convolutional base was used to obtain high-dimensional features per image. To reduce dimensionality and improve classification performance, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) was employed to select the most discriminative subset of features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based fitness function. Multiple classifiers were then trained and evaluated using the optimized feature set. Among them, the Artificial Neural Network integrated with WOA (ANN+WOA) achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98%, demonstrating the potential of the proposed model for reliable, efficient, and automated MS diagnosis.",

      "title": "Exploring physical and functional EEG connectivity with multilayer graph transformer convolutional networks for emotion recognition",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition has emerged as a compelling direction in affective computing, driven by its ability to provide objective, neural-level insights into emotional states. However, the high-dimensional and complex spatial and functional characteristics of EEG data present substantial challenges for accurate modeling. To address this, we propose Multilayer-GTCN (Multilayer Graph Transformer Convolutional Network), which combines the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Transformer layers to effectively capture both local and global dependencies in EEG signals. The framework employs a dual-graph design over feature nodes: a physical proximity graph instantiated as a complete topology to stabilize information flow, and a functional connectivity graph whose edges are correlations derived from inter-feature relationships. Within this representation, GCN layers consolidate stable relational patterns, while transformer-based graph convolutions capture long-range dependencies and transient interactions across the feature space. Combining the two encoded views results in representations that jointly capture localized structure and global context, providing a robust basis for affective decoding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 98.24\u2009\u00b1\u20091.74% on SEED, 95.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.89% on SEED-IV, and 93.35\u2009\u00b1\u20094.08% (valence) / 94.11\u2009\u00b1\u20092.98% (arousal) on DEAP. These results highlight the efficiency and flexibility of Multilayer-GTCN across varied datasets. By merging a physical proximity graph with correlation-based functional connectivity in a multilayer architecture, this study lays a foundation for scalable affective-computing systems and delivers a framework to guide upcoming advances in neural signal study.",

      "title": "Differential arousal and neural engagement for angry and fearful faces: a combined pupillometric and fMRI study",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how emotions are encoded at the neural level remains a central challenge in human neuroscience. Facial expressions are among the most powerful and frequently used stimuli to study emotion processing. Face perception itself is a complex function supported by a core network\u2014including bilateral occipito-fusiform and superior temporal regions\u2014and an extended network involving anterior structures such as the bilateral amygdalae. However, previous findings on how emotional content modulates these networks have been inconsistent.MethodsTo disentangle perceptual and affective components of face emotion processing, we combined high-frequency pupillometry with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Pupillary dilation serves as a sensitive index of two distinct processes: perceptual load, reflecting the informational complexity of a face, and arousal, indicating its immediate sensory impact. In our study, 25 participants (13 female) viewed faces expressing anger, fear, happiness, or neutrality as well as luminance-matched houses serving as control stimuli. A one-back task unrelated to emotion masked the true experimental purpose.ResultsRelative to houses, faces elicited stronger pupillary dilations as well as enhanced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in bilateral occipital and fusiform cortices as well as in both amygdalae. Among facial expressions, angry faces evoked the largest pupillary dilations, while fearful faces elicited the strongest neural responses within a right-lateralized network centered on the superior temporal sulcus (rSTS). Across all faces>houses (conjunction minimum-statistic inference), pupil size correlated positively with BOLD activity in the right fusiform gyrus (rFFG), left inferior occipital gyrus (lIOG), bilateral calcarine cortex, and bilateral lingual gyrus.DiscussionThese findings indicate that emotional faces impose a higher perceptual load than matched control stimuli, engaging a distributed network spanning early visual and attention-related areas. In conclusion, our results suggest that emotional quality is specified early in the perceptual process, with divergent pupillary and neural signatures separating arousal-driven threat responses (anger) from socially complex alarm cues (fear).",

      "content": "Naturalistic interactions involve dynamic, nonlinear coordination that unfolds across multiple timescales, yet most hyperscanning studies rely on analytical methods designed for passive, stimulus-locked contexts. We introduce cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA)\u2014a method that treats signals as a coupled dynamical system and characterizes the patterns of their joint trajectories across time\u2014to measure brain-to-brain coupling during a free-flowing negotiation task. Dyads were scanned with fNIRS as they negotiated budget allocations to solve a public health crisis. We measured neural coupling in regions critical for social cognition\u2014medial prefrontal cortex and temporal parietal junction\u2014and related coupling patterns to both objective negotiation behaviors and subjective experiences. While conventional measures of neural synchrony, such as inter-subject correlation and wavelet coherence, showed no relationships with outcomes, CRQA revealed systematic associations between dynamic coupling patterns and successful interaction. We found that balanced neural coordination, where leading and lagging flowed symmetrically between partners, predicted greater collaborative allocation adjustment and more positive social experiences, including shared understanding, cooperation, and liking. Longer delays in neurocognitive coordination, as opposed to immediate alignment, were associated with greater feelings of motivation during the interaction. Finally, greater complexity, or entropy, of neural coupling was linked to more parity in how partners moved toward the joint solution rather than a one-sided accommodation. These findings demonstrate that real social interaction can be captured through analytical methods that account for the dynamic, nonlinear processes being studied, creating new possibilities for understanding how minds connect during natural human interaction.",

      "content": "Intelligent prosthetic hips and knees represent a critical advancement in restoring natural gait and mobility for lower-limb amputees, particularly those with high-level amputations such as hip disarticulation. This systematic review examines recent progress in three fundamental aspects of intelligent prosthetic technology: actuation, perception, and control. In terms of actuation, the review highlights the limitations of passive and active prostheses and discusses emerging hybrid active-passive mechanisms that aim to replicate the natural, biarticular muscle-driven energy transfer in human gait. The perception section addresses current methodologies for recognizing human motion intentions through mechanical, bioelectric, biomechanical, and external environmental signals, underscoring the challenges of stability, latency, and interference inherent in existing approaches. Regarding control strategies, the paper categorizes intelligent control into torque compensation, motion following, and direct intention control, outlining the strengths and limitations of each method. The review identifies critical technological bottlenecks, including signal interference, limited adaptability to dynamic environments, and the absence of effective real-time intention recognition methods. The paper concludes by suggesting future directions in the development of hybrid actuation and advanced perception-control integration, essential for improving the usability and efficacy of intelligent prosthetic hips and knees, ultimately enhancing mobility and quality of life for amputees.",
