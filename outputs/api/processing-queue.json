      "content": "<p>Hippocampal maps and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) value and goal representations support foraging in continuous spaces. How might hippocampal&ndash;vPFC interactions control the balance between behavioral exploration and exploitation? Using fMRI and reinforcement learning modeling, we investigated vPFC and hippocampal responses as humans (38 female, 34 male) explored and exploited a continuous one-dimensional space, with out-of-session and out-of-sample replication (23 female, 20 male). The spatial distribution of rewards, or value landscape, modulated activity in the hippocampus and default network vPFC subregions, but not in ventrolateral prefrontal control subregions or medial orbitofrontal limbic subregions. While prefrontal default network and hippocampus displayed higher activity in less complex, easy-to-exploit value landscapes, vPFC&ndash;hippocampal connectivity increased in uncertain landscapes requiring exploration. Further, synchronization between prefrontal default network and posterior hippocampus scaled with behavioral exploration. Considered alongside electrophysiological studies, our findings suggest that exploration targets are identified through coordinated activity binding prefrontal default network value representations to posterior hippocampal maps.</p>",

      "title": "Behavioral Relevance of Early Neural Coding of Low-Level Odor Features in Humans",
      "content": "<p>Understanding how the brain transforms peripheral sensory inputs into higher-level representations, and how these contribute to perception and behavioral performance, is a central question in sensory neuroscience. However, in human olfaction, the temporal evolution of neural odor codes and their functional significance remain poorly characterized, especially at early stages. To address which odor features define early neural responses and how these relate to olfactory function, we recorded EEG from male and female participants as they inhaled diverse odors. Participants also completed standardized tests of odor detection, discrimination, and identification, along with questionnaires. Time- and frequency-resolved decoding and representational similarity analysis revealed that early theta activity encodes low-level physicochemical properties of odor molecules, with encoding peaking at 370 ms. Critically, the fidelity of this early theta coding to odor physicochemical properties selectively correlated with participants&rsquo; trait-level odor discrimination ability, but not with other olfactory measures. In contrast, delta-band representations of pleasantness emerged later (peaking at 980&nbsp;ms), linked only to trait-level odor affective reactivity, as measured by questionnaires. These results suggest that earlier theta-band representations reflect a distinct functional role from the later-emerging delta-band activity and are associated with olfactory performance. Extending these findings, separate EEG recordings during a task involving odor discrimination showed that early theta decoding accuracy was significantly higher on correct than incorrect trials, indicating that theta-band coding accounts for trial-by-trial performance fluctuations. Collectively, our study demonstrates that early theta-band representations of low-level odor features&mdash;prior to perceptual representations&mdash;are already functionally relevant to odor-guided behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Thalamic Interictal Epileptic and Non-Epileptic Events during NREM Sleep in Patients with Focal Epilepsy: a Stereo-EEG Study",
      "content": "Background: Thalamic recordings are increasingly incorporated into stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) evaluations of drug-resistant focal epilepsy to guide neuromodulation targeting. Human thalamic electrophysiology, however, is poorly defined, limiting the distinction between pathological and physiological activity. Here, we characterized interictal epileptic and non-epileptic events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep across multiple thalamic nuclei and examined their relationship to seizure outcomes. Methods: We analyzed NREM sleep SEEG recordings from 64 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Electrodes sampled four thalamic nuclei: centromedian (CM), pulvinar (Pu), ventral lateral (VL), and ventral posterolateral (VPL). Patients were classified into three outcome groups: favorable, unfavorable, and surgically non-remediable. Rates of thalamic spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spike-fast activity, and sleep spindles were analyzed and compared across nuclei and outcomes. Findings: Recordings of the thalamus revealed both pathological and physiological interictal events. Interictal epileptic events were infrequent. Only ~0.2% of seizure-onset zone spikes propagated to the thalamus. Thalamic spike-fast activity was indicative of unfavorable outcomes (CM: p = 0.047, d = 0.46) or surgically non-remediable epilepsy (VL: p = 0.002, d = 0.84). In contrast, thalamic sleep spindles were ubiquitous but reduced in surgically non-remediable patients (CM: p = 0.031, d = -0.58; VL: p = 0.005, d = -0.79). Finally, unique thalamic SEEG patterns were identified, including spikes concomitant with spindles, isolated spikes, and physiological fast ripples. Interpretation: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of thalamic interictal events during NREM sleep, enriching our understanding of thalamic pathophysiology and highlighting the value of thalamic recordings in pre-surgery evaluation.",

      "content": "Synaptome architecture describes the spatiotemporal distribution of highly diverse excitatory synapses throughout the brain. Whether and how this architecture is impacted by experience is key to understanding its role in learning and memory. We found that environmental enrichment and monocular visual deprivation drive large-scale, type- and subtype-specific reorganisation of excitatory synapses in more than one hundred brain regions. Each experience modifies distinct subsets of synapses, with patterns aligned with protein turnover rates and connectome architecture. These reorganisations occur during development and adulthood, revealing a conserved mechanism of synaptome plasticity across the lifespan. Our findings support a population-selection model in which experience drives adaptation by selectively modifying synapse varieties, generating a distributed trace of past experiences. Our results also point to synaptome architecture as a shared framework integrating experience, lifespan changes, sleep, genetic variation and disease.",

      "title": "Axonal growth of cortical neurons does not require paxillin",
      "content": "Axon growth is an essential cellular process during neural development, and its dysregulation contributes to numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. During axon growth, extracellular signals direct neurons to extend projections that connect with their synaptic targets. Paxillin is a key member of adhesion sites that control motility by linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Paxillin also binds to the cytoskeletal protein, tubulin. However, little is known about the role of adhesion proteins in neurons. Here, we use conditional paxillin knockout mice to investigate how loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons affects developing neuron morphology. Surprisingly, loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons caused no change in axon length or soma area between control (PxnF/F) and conditional paxillin knockout (PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre) mice at basal conditions. Following brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation, the loss of paxillin resulted in no change in soma area or axonal {beta}-tubulin levels, but did result in a significant increase in axon length, as compared to control. Finally, the corpus callosum size was not significantly different between PxnF/F and PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre animals. In summary, these data suggest that paxillin is not required for axonal growth during neural development.",

      "content": "<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent disorder with limited therapeutic options. The central amygdala (CeA) is a critical brain region as dysregulation within the CeA and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system are associated with AUD pathology. CeA CRF1 receptors regulate alcohol drinking and have served as a therapeutic target in alcohol treatment. One emerging potential therapeutic for AUD is psilocybin. Psilocybin has been shown to decrease drinking in some clinical studies; however, the effects are variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Psilocybin engages many brain regions, including the CeA, and may produce therapeutic effects on drinking through interactions with CeA CRF1 neurons. The current study explores the effects of psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, on voluntary ethanol drinking and CeA CRF1 activity to understand potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocin. Psilocin acutely decreased ethanol consumption in mice exposed to two different models of chronic ethanol exposure without producing changes in locomotor behavior. Psilocin increased CeA activation and decreased relative CRF1 activation in CeA subregions from ethanol-naive female CRF1:GFP mice. These results were also observed in chronic ethanol-exposed mice at 24 and 72&nbsp;h withdrawal timepoints. Psilocin increased corticosterone at 24&nbsp;h withdrawal but not at 72&nbsp;h withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that psilocin engages CeA circuitry and decreases relative CRF1 activation, in parallel with acute reductions in drinking. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of psilocin and inform the interpretation of therapeutic effects in clinical studies.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old human infants track maternal versus unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants (13 boys, 12 girls) showed stronger neural tracking of their mother's voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Furthermore, central encoding of unfamiliar faces was diminished when infants heard their mother's voice and face tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with earlier occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy versus fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.</p>",

      "title": "Dual Role of LH-GABA Neurons in Encoding Alcohol Reward and Aversive Memories",
      "content": "<p>One of the core aspects of alcohol use disorder is continued use despite negative consequences. Individuals with an alcohol use disorder typically engage in behaviors which represent a failure to integrate the aversive consequences of their actions. The neural mechanisms of learning about conflicting experiences remain poorly understood. Previous research has highlighted the critical role of GABAergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH-GABA) in rewarding memories. However, whether this role extends to aversive outcomes and competition between rewarding and aversive outcomes remains unexplored. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of LH-GABA neurons in encoding and expressing alcohol reward and aversive memories using fiber photometry calcium imaging. We used a dual-virus approach to confine expression of jGCaMP7f to GABAergic neurons in LH of male and female Long&ndash;Evans rats. In our first experiment, following acquisition of a cue&ndash;alcohol association, a mild footshock was introduced on 50% of the trials. In the second experiment, we used three different cues to signal alcohol, footshock, or no consequence. Subsequently, we combined these conditioned stimuli in pairs to evoke motivational conflict. Our results reveal that LH-GABA activity is associated with cues predictive of both appetitive and aversive outcomes and is highest to a cue predictive of an aversive outcome. Additionally, the response of LH-GABA activity to an aversive shock stimulus is attenuated in the presence of alcohol. In summary, our findings show the activity of LH-GABA neurons is involved in learning both appetitive and aversive associations and their interaction in conflict.</p>",

      "title": "Experience-Dependent Plasticity to Visual Sequences in Mouse Anterior Cingulate Cortex Reflects Familiarity",
      "content": "<p>Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is a prefrontal area implicated in functions including cognitive control, attention, and prediction. Mouse ACC receives input from the visual system and uses visual information to direct behavior. While extensive work has described experience-dependent plasticity in mouse V1, less is known about how ACC itself adapts to visual experience. Our previous work demonstrated that visual sequences, presented across days, can drive plasticity in the timing of visually evoked responses in mouse ACC. However, it is not known whether this plasticity (\"sequence plasticity\") reflects familiarity to the first stimulus in a sequence or expectation of subsequent stimuli&mdash;a distinction that is critically important for understanding its functional significance. We recorded visually evoked responses in awake, head-fixed female and male mice trained with visual sequences across days. Visual sequences drove plasticity in ACC, expressed through a change in response timing, that reflects familiarity to the first stimulus. In addition, experience-dependent plasticity could be induced using single-orientation stimuli. Together, these findings suggest that \"sequence plasticity\" in ACC does not in fact require sequences, but rather reflects a broader phenomenon that we term stimulus-specific response plasticity in timing (SRPT). Our prior work demonstrated that ACC plasticity is impaired in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome (AS). Here, AS model mice showed abnormal responses to familiar visual stimuli in ACC, despite normal plasticity in V1. Together, this work demonstrates how mouse ACC adapts to familiar visual stimuli and describes impaired ACC function in a mouse model of a neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",
