      "title": "Senescent astrocytic deposits drive cognitive decline by disrupting tripartite synapse in the aging brain",
      "content": "Brain aging involves synapse decline, with astrocytes playing a key role in synapse homeostasis. However, the impact of astrocyte senescence on synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline remains unclear. Here, we identified a hallmark of aging astrocytes Senescent Astrocytic Deposits (SAD) observed at aged rodents, macaques, and human hippocampal astrocytic processes that is associated with tripartite synapse dysfunction and memory decline. Laser capture microdissection-coupled mass spectrometry (LCM-MS), spatial transcriptome analysis and 3D electron microscopy revealed that SAD are abnormal protein deposits at the processes of ApoE-high expression astrocyte subtype and associated with dysfunctional tripartite synapses. Using a transgenic mouse (Nrbf2 knockout) with accelerated SAD formation as a tool for genetic manipulation, we clearly demonstrated that age-dependent defect of phagocytosis at maturation stage in astrocytic drives SAD accumulation, synaptic injury and cognitive deficits. Collectively, our findings establish SAD as a mechanistic link between astrocyte senescence and synaptic damage, underscoring the critical role of astrocytic phagocytic function in preserving synaptic homeostasis and cognitive function during aging.",

      "title": "Deletion of Cacna1c (CaV1.2) in D1-expressing cells elicits divergent sex-specific effects on aversive and spatial memories",
      "content": "Dopamine signaling is critical for cognitive and emotional regulation and is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. One downstream effector of dopamine is the L-type calcium channel CaV1.2, encoded by the risk gene CACNA1C. Genome-wide association studies have consistently linked CACNA1C single nucleotide polymorphisms to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related conditions. We previously showed that homozygous deletion of Cacna1c in dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-expressing cells enhances remote (30 days post-training) contextual fear memory in male mice. Here, we extend these findings by examining sex- and gene dosage-specific behavioral consequences of Cacna1c loss in D1 cells. We find that D1-Cacna1c deletion produces a sex- and gene dosage-dependent effect on fear memory. In males, homozygous loss of D1-Cacna1c heightens remote contextual fear at 30-days post-training, replicating prior findings, whereas partial loss had no effect. Cue-associated fear memory remained unaffected across genotypes. In contrast, females exhibited heightened contextual fear with both heterozygous and homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss at 24-hrs, 7-days, and 30-days post-training, indicating increased sensitivity to contextual aversive learning. Cue-associated fear memory was higher at 24-hrs but normalized at later time points in females. In the Water Y-maze, males with heterozygous or homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss showed impaired spatial memory at 7-days post-training, whereas females were unaffected. D1-Cacna1c deletion reduced locomotor activity selectively in females during the initial 5-mins of a 60-min session, with no genotype effects in males. Social interaction and anxiety-like behavior were unchanged across groups. Together, these findings highlight the interplay between dopamine receptor signaling and calcium channel function in shaping sex-dependent aspects of memory.",

      "title": "Tuned to explore: Increased phasic responses to auditory targets and novelty in children regardless of induced tonic arousal",
      "content": "The ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions is critical during childhood, as it supports learning, social interaction, and adaptation to changing environments. This attentional balance is thought to depend in part on arousal regulation, mediated by the activity of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Moderate levels of arousal are typically associated with optimal cognitive performance. However, the interaction between arousal and attention remains poorly understood in humans, especially during development. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally modulating tonic arousal, the baseline level of physiological alertness, affects attentional processing in children (N = 44, aged 6-8) and adults (N = 46, aged 18-35). Participants performed an active auditory three-stimulus (standard, novel, target) oddball task, designed to assess selective attention to target tones and distraction by novel sounds. Prior to each task block, tonic arousal was manipulated using music or videos varying in arousing content. Physiological responses were recorded continuously (skin conductance, pupil dilation, heart rate) to index both tonic arousal and transient, phasic changes in arousal triggered by task events. While tonic arousal modulation was successful, as confirmed by skin conductance levels, Bayesian analyses provided evidence for no effect of this modulation on subsequent attentional processing. Importantly, children generally exhibited stronger phasic arousal responses, particularly to task-irrelevant novel sounds, reflecting less mature regulation of attention and arousal. These findings show developmental differences in physiological responses to unexpected environmental stimuli and provide physiological evidence of increased distractibility during childhood.",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Electrophysiological and behavioural responses to consonant and dissonant piano chords as standardised affective stimuli",
      "content": "Although the difference between consonance and dissonance has raised interest for decades in various fields of science, isolated chords are still underutilised as standardised affective stimuli in neuroscience. In the present study, we assessed whether consonant, dissonant, and neutral sounds evoked different subjective and neurophysiological responses associated with the emotional experience. For the first time, we conducted a comprehensive study of piano timbre chord perception, combining behavioural assessments, event-related potentials (ERPs), frequency-domain electroencephalography (EEG) analysis of amplitude, neurodynamic (longrange temporal correlations (LRTC)) factors, and source analysis. In an experiment, 30 participants rated the valence of sounds (consonance, dissonance, neutral) whilst simultaneously undergoing EEG recordings. At the behavioural level, a stable valence gradient was revealed: consonance was perceived as pleasant, dissonance as unpleasant, and the neutral group of stimuli as neutral. Analysis of ERPs revealed differences in response across three time windows (90\u2013110\u202fms, 190\u2013210\u202fms, 290\u2013310\u202fms) and activation of frontotemporal and temporoparietal areas during the processing of dissonant chords. At the level of frequency and neurodynamic indices (gamma and beta bands amplitudes and LRTC), we demonstrated that classification accuracy depends on the interaction between chord type and the EEG\u2019s amplitude- and scale-invariant characteristics for dissonant and neutral stimuli. These results provide evidence that isolated chords evoke differentiated emotional and cognitive responses, highlighting their potential utility as affective stimuli in future studies.",

      "title": "High-accuracy electrode implantation in deep brain structures using multi-camera neuronavigation in non-human primates",
      "content": "Objective. Precise electrophysiological recordings and stimulation of deep brain structures in large animal models such as non-human primates require highly accurate targeting methods that are currently lacking. Approach. To address this limitation, we have integrated advanced multi-camera neuronavigation, high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography), and tailored surgical methods to chronically implant electrodes in deep structures of the macaque brain, with an accuracy below or at the millimeter scale. Main results. We first illustrate the advantage of multi-camera neuronavigation over traditional two-camera systems in 3D-printed head models, demonstrating that a submillimeter accuracy requires at least five cameras. We then introduce a detailed experimental protocol using skull-based registration for reaching submillimeter accuracies in vivo. This protocol was optimized and tested in three macaque monkeys across seven implantations targeting the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex, including five performed with skull-based registration. Next, we quantify our targeting accuracy for these two structures by in vivo neuroimaging and histological analyses. We show that our skull-based registration procedure enabled to target the entorhinal cortex with submillimetric accuracy (0.55 mm and 0.89 mm in two animals), while implantation errors for the hippocampus were slightly higher (1.11 mm and 1.68 mm in two animals). Finally, we validate our approach with electrophysiological recordings of these targeted structures during drowsiness and stimulation-induced epileptiform afterdischarges in two chronically implanted animals. Significance. This technological and surgical framework provides a means to record and stimulate deep brain structures in large animal models with submillimetric to millimetric accuracy.",

      "content": "Objective. Accurate detection and classification of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become increasingly important for identifying epileptogenic zones in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, few open-source platforms offer both state-of-the-art computational methods and user-friendly interfaces to support practical clinical use. Approach. We present PyHFO 2.0, an enhanced open-source, Python-based platform that extends previous work by incorporating a more comprehensive set of detection methods and deep learning (DL) tools for HFO analysis. The platform now supports three commonly used detectors: short-term energy, Montreal Neurological Institute, and a newly integrated Hilbert transform-based detector. For HFO classification, PyHFO 2.0 includes DL models for artifact rejection, spike HFO detection, and identification of epileptogenic HFOs. These models are integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem for automatic loading and can be replaced with custom-trained alternatives. An interactive annotation module enables clinicians and researchers to inspect, verify, and reclassify events. Main results. All detection and classification modules were evaluated using clinical EEG datasets, supporting the applicability of the platform in both research and translational settings. Validation across multiple datasets demonstrated close alignment with expert-labeled annotations and standard tools such as RIPPLELAB. Significance. PyHFO 2.0 aims to simplify the use of computational neuroscience tools in both research and clinical environments by combining methodological rigor with a user-friendly graphical interface. Its scalable architecture and model integration capabilities support a range of applications in biomarker discovery, epilepsy diagnostics, and clinical decision support, bridging advanced computation and practical usability.",

      "title": "A methodological framework for the efficient characterization of peripheral nerve stimulation parameters",
      "content": "Objective. Restoring movement and somatosensation with peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) requires precise neural activation. Because pulse amplitude (PA) and pulse width (PW) recruit axons differently, intentionally modulating both could enable more advanced PNS. However, mapping the PA-PW space is currently prohibitively time-intensive. This paper proposes and clinically validates an efficient method to characterize multiple intensities in the PA-PW space for motor and perceptual sensory applications using minimal data collection. Approach. We used cuff electrodes implanted in one participant with a spinal cord injury to generate iso-EMG activation contours and two participants with upper limb loss to generate somatosensory perceptual iso-intensity contours in the PA-PW space. Strength-duration (SD) curves were mapped to the contours using varying sample point subsets and assessed for fit quality. Finite element modeling of a human nerve and activation simulations evaluated differences in recruited axon populations across the PA-PW space. Main results. SD curves accurately fit all levels of motor activation and perceptual intensity (median and , respectively). Reliable estimates of SD curves at any intensity require only two sufficiently-spaced points (motor , sensory ). Using this data, we present and validate a novel method for efficiently characterizing the PA-PW space using SD curves, including a metric that quantifies mapping accuracy based on two sampled points. In silico, intensity-matched high-PW and high-PA stimulation recruited overlapping, but not equivalent, axon sets, with high-PA stimuli preferentially recruiting large-diameter fibers and axons farther from the contact. Significance. This method enables rapid, accurate mapping of the stimulation parameter space for clinical motor and sensory PNS. The efficiency of the proposed characterization approach enhances the clinical feasibility of multiparameter modulation, establishing a framework for further exploration of two-parameter modulation for increased selectivity and resolution, reduced fatigue, and unique percept generation.

      "title": "Oligodendrocytes support functional development of subcortical premotor neurons and navigation",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce are required for proper balance behaviors in adult vertebrates. If, when, and how they shape the functional development of vestibular (balance) circuits and associated behaviors is unclear. We first adopted a pharmacological approach to investigate the contribution of oligodendrocytes across early development of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Disruption of oligodendrogenesis reduces the number of oligodendrocytes near vestibular neurons across development, but only impacts vertical navigation -- a behavior requiring vestibular function -- in older larvae. Correspondingly, we found that midbrain premotor neurons in the vertical navigation circuit only decreased their responses to tilts at later ages. In contrast, we found that the vestibulo-ocular reflex was unaffected by drug treatment, and that body-tilt responses in the underlying hindbrain vestibular neurons and their target extraocular motor neurons were unchanged. Targeted photoablation of oligodendrocytes in the anterior hindbrain replicated our pharmacological findings, selectively disrupting vertical navigation in older animals. By dissociating where and when developmentally-disrupted oligodendrogenesis impacts neuronal function and behavior, our work takes a major step towards understanding how oligodendrocytes enable the maturation of sensorimotor behaviors.",

      "content": "In vitro modelling of highly vulnerable nigral dopaminergic (DA) neuronal subtypes in Parkinson's disease (PD), is necessary for studying disease mechanisms. Here, we optimized a new approach by expressing the pioneer neurogenic transcription factor, Achaete-scute-like 1 (Ascl1), implicated in determining dopaminergic fate. Sequential small-molecule patterning of iPSCs into early floor plate mesencephalic progenitors, followed by inducible Ascl1 expression, rapidly differentiates midbrain DA neurons. Immunocytochemistry and transcriptomic analysis of these patterned Ascl1-driven DA neurons (PA-DANs) confirmed midbrain-lineage specificity. Importantly, we found an enrichment of DA subpopulations that corresponded to the adult human ventral SOX6-positive A9 DA subtypes vulnerable in PD. Furthermore, we combined these ventral A9-like PA-DANs with human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes and microglia in defined ratios to generate mature 3D A9-like assembled organoids that display characteristic spontaneous neuronal activity and electrical propagation along the axon. Our method efficiently generates a mature and functional A9-like DA neuronal platform to study PD.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis.

      "title": "Neonatal brain volumes and birth characteristics predict behavioural outcomes in toddlerhood",
      "content": "Background: Early brain structure and birth factors (e.g., sex, birth weight, gestational age at birth) are understood as critical to shaping lifelong developmental and psychopathological outcomes. Methods: Using data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, we examined whether neonatal brain volumes and birth factors predict developmental and socioemotional outcomes in toddlerhood. Structural MRI scans were acquired from 391 infants at birth (193 females, 198 males; mean age = 8 days), with follow-up behavioural assessments conducted in toddlerhood (mean age = 18 months). Results: Results demonstrated that larger neonatal brain volumes were associated with lower autistic traits and higher cognitive, language and motor outcomes. A higher gestational age and weight at birth were associated with higher scores on various of these outcomes - an effect that was partially mediated by larger brain volumes at birth. Females showed higher language scores compared to males, though this effect was suppressed rather than mediated by neonatal brain volumes. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate how birth factors interactively shape early developmental and neuropsychiatric outcomes.",

      "title": "From perception to valence: a pair of interneurons that assign positive valence to sweet sensation in Drosophila",
      "content": "Assigning valence, appeal or aversion, to gustatory stimuli and relaying it to higher-order brain regions to guide flexible behaviors is crucial to survival. Yet the neural circuit that transforms gustatory input into motivationally relevant signals remains poorly defined in any model system. In Drosophila melanogaster, substantial progress has been made in mapping the sensorimotor pathway for feeding and the architecture of the dopaminergic reinforcement system. However, where and how valence is first assigned to a taste has long been a mystery. Here, we identified a pair of subesophageal zone interneurons in Drosophila, termed Fox, that impart positive valence to sweet taste and convey this signal to the mushroom body, the fly's associative learning center. We show that Fox neuron activity is necessary and sufficient to drive appetitive behaviors and can override a tastant's intrinsic valence without impairing taste quality discrimination. Furthermore, Fox neurons transmit the positive valence to specific dopaminergic neurons that mediate appetitive memory formation. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism that transforms sweet sensation into a reinforcing signal to support learned sugar responses. The Fox neurons exhibit a convergent-divergent \"hourglass\" circuit motif, acting as a bottleneck for valence assignment and distributing motivational signals to higher-order centers. This architecture confers both robustness and flexibility in reward processing: an organizational principle that may generalize across species.",

      "title": "Task-optimized models of sensory uncertainty reproduce human confidence judgments",
      "content": "Sensory input is often ambiguous, leading to uncertain interpretations of the external world. Estimates of perceptual uncertainty might be useful in guiding behavior, but it remains unclear whether humans explicitly represent uncertainty in naturalistic settings, and whether any such representations are normatively correct. Progress has been hindered by the absence of stimulus-computable models that estimate uncertainty. We developed a class of task-optimized models that generate probability distributions over perceptual estimates. To assess whether human uncertainty representations align with the model's, we compared human confidence judgments, which might indirectly reflect uncertainty representations, to confidence judgments extracted from the model's uncertainty. In both sound localization and pitch perception, human confidence varied systematically, being lower for stimuli that produced more variable estimates across trials. Human confidence tracked model confidence across conditions, suggesting that human uncertainty representations accurately reflect the actual uncertainty of perceptual estimation. The modeling framework is extensible to other perceptual domains.",
