      "title": "Optimized reference region and the effect on test-retest reliability and detection of Parkinson's disease with UCB-J.",
      "content": "[11C]UCB-J is a radioligand targeting synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, used to image synaptic density. For quantification, a small-volume centrum semiovale area was previously optimized as a [11C]UCB-J reference region (CS2mL); however, its high variability resulted in reduced reliability. Herin, we evaluated an alternative reference region method to assess longitudinal test-retest reliability and detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). For estimating distribution volume ratio (DVR), CS2mL and eleven white matter (WM) reference regions (range: 0.5-200 mL) were generated using the Freesurfer WM map. Same-day and longitudinal test-retest variability (TRV) were assessed (24 healthy subjects (HS); n=10 same-day and n=20 longitudinal HRRT scans, range: 7-1028 days). Each reference region was used to evaluate the substantia nigra (SN) and caudate DVRs in HS (n=25) and PD (n=20). The 10mL WM reference region yielded [11C]UCB-J DVR measurements with reduced variability in TRV (same-day: 10mL: 1.2{+/-}5.7%, same-day: CS2mL: -0.9{+/-}9.2% longitudinal: 10mL: 1.5{+/-}7.0%, CS2mL: 1.6{+/-}11.9%,) while maintaining less than 10% volume of distribution difference, compared to CS2mL. Further, a significant difference between PD and HS groups in SN and caudate DVRs was found using 10mL, with greater effect size (Cohen's d 0.61 for SN and 0.66 for caudate) compared to CS2mL (0.38 for SN and 0.43 for caudate).",

      "title": "Ascending propriospinal modulation of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons during lumbar locomotor activity",
      "content": "Although the autonomic sympathetic system is activated in parallel with locomotion, the underlying neural mechanisms mediating this coordination are not completely understood. Descending exercise or central command signals from hypothalamic and brainstem regions are thought to activate thoracic spinal sympathetic neurons in parallel with descending locomotor commands. In turn, subsets of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) then increase activation of a constellation of tissues and organs that provide homeostatic and metabolic support during movement and exercise. It is known that neurons within the spinal cord (propriospinal networks) can generate well-coordinated and sustained locomotor activity but whether these propriospinal networks contribute to coordination between locomotor and autonomic systems is unknown. To investigate this, we applied neurochemicals to elicit whole-cord or lumbar-evoked locomotor activity in an in vitro spinal cord preparation, simultaneously recording lumbar ventral root (VR) activity and changes in calcium fluorescence of pre-labelled SPNs in thoracic segments. Using whole-bath drug application to elicit hindlimb locomotor activity, recorded SPN responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) compared to caudal (T8 to T11) segments. When locomotor-inducing neurochemicals were applied only to the lumbar region using a split-bath configuration, SPN population responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) but not caudal (T8 to T9) segments during both tonic and rhythmic VR activity. In both approaches, the greatest numbers of SPNs with increased fluorescence during rhythmic activity were in T6/7, whereas the greatest numbers with unchanged or decreased fluorescence were in caudal segments (T8 to T11). Together these findings reveal a strong ascending lumbar to thoracic integrating communication pathway and may represent a key feature of spinal neural network function normally. Such communication pathways should be further investigated for targeted autonomic function(s) activation and therapeutic benefit after spinal cord injury.",

      "content": "Adversarial training is an effective defense method for deep models against adversarial attacks. However, current adversarial training methods require retraining the entire neural network, which consumes a significant amount of computational resources, thereby affecting the timeliness of deep models and further hindering the rapid learning process of new knowledge. In response to the above problems, this article proposes an incremental adversarial training method (IncAT) and applies it to the...",

      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",
