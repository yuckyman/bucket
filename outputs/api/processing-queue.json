      "content": "arXiv:2511.02838v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A concise overview is provided of selected theoretical models of communication competence in the fields of linguistics, interpersonal communication, second language use, and human-robot interaction. The following practical research consisted of two case studies with the goals of investigating how advanced AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini interpret elements of two communication competence theories in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) interactions with users. The focus was on these theoretical approaches: (1) an integrated linguistic-interpersonal model and (2) an interpersonal \"human-humanoid\" interaction model. The conclusion is that both approaches are suitable for a better understanding of LLM-user interaction.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02837v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the context of increasing urban risks, particularly from climate change-induced flooding, this paper presents an extended Reality (XR)-based framework to improve user risk training within urban built environments. The framework is designed to improve risk awareness and preparedness among various stakeholders, including citizens, local authorities, and emergency responders. Using immersive XR technologies, the training experience simulates real-world emergency scenarios, contributing to active participation and a deeper understanding of potential hazards and especially for floods. The framework highlights the importance of stakeholder participation in its development, ensuring that training modules are customized to address the specific needs of different user groups. The iterative approach of the framework supports ongoing refinement through user feedback and performance data, thus improving the overall effectiveness of risk training initiatives. This work outlines the methodological phases involved in the framework's implementation, including i) user flow mapping, ii) scenario selection, and iii) performance evaluation, with a focus on the pilot application in Senigallia, Italy. The findings underscore the potential of XR technologies to transform urban risk training, promoting a culture of preparedness and resilience against urban hazards.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.01192v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Objective. Personalized transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has gained growing attention due to the substantial inter-individual variability in brain anatomy and physiology. While previous reviews have discussed the physiological mechanisms and clinical applications of tES, there remains a critical gap in up-to-date syntheses focused on the computational modeling frameworks that enable individualized stimulation optimization. Approach. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advances in computational techniques supporting personalized tES. We systematically examine developments in forward modeling for simulating individualized electric fields, as well as inverse modeling approaches for optimizing stimulation parameters. We critically evaluate progress in head modeling pipelines, optimization algorithms, and the integration of multimodal brain data. Main results. Recent advances have substantially accelerated the construction of subject-specific head conductor models and expanded the landscape of optimization methods, including multi-objective optimization and brain network-informed optimization. These advances allow for dynamic and individualized stimulation planning, moving beyond empirical trial-and-error approaches.Significance. By integrating the latest developments in computational modeling for personalized tES, this review highlights current challenges, emerging opportunities, and future directions for achieving precision neuromodulation in both research and clinical contexts.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.00730v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.",

      "content": "arXiv:2503.06286v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Large-scale visual neural datasets such as the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) are boosting computational neuroscience research by enabling models of the brain with performances beyond what was possible just a decade ago. However, because the stimuli of these datasets typically live within a common naturalistic visual distribution, they do not allow for strict out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization tests which are crucial for the development of more robust models. Here, we address this limitation by releasing NSD-synthetic, a dataset consisting of 7T fMRI responses from the same eight NSD participants for 284 synthetic images. We show that NSD-synthetic's fMRI responses reliably encode stimulus-related information and are OOD with respect to NSD. Furthermore, we provide a proof of principle that OOD generalization tests on NSD-synthetic reveal differences between models of the brain that are not detected with the original NSD data; we demonstrate that the degree of OOD (quantified as the distance between a set of responses and the training data used for modeling) is predictive of the magnitude of model failures; and we show that less strict OOD generalization tests can can be usefully applied even within the domain of naturalistic stimuli. These results showcase how NSD-synthetic enables OOD generalization tests that facilitate the development of more robust models of visual processing and the formulation of more accurate theories of human vision.",

The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological disease.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.03643v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When people pursue rewards in stochastic environments, they often match their choice frequencies to the observed target frequencies, even when this policy is demonstrably sub-optimal. We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.",

We revisit our previous proposal suggesting that content-specific beta reflects the flexible recruiting of transient neural ensembles and update it to emphasize frequency as the relevant parameter. We argue that beta frequency shifts arise from changes in connectivity between weakly coupled oscillators and that, more than a spectral fingerprint, they reflect an active mechanism to (re)-activate behaviorally relevant communication channels in the brain.",

      "title": "Emergent tuning heterogeneity in cortical circuits is sensitive to cellular neuronal dynamics",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.03502v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cortical circuits exhibit high levels of response diversity, even across apparently uniform neuronal populations. While emerging data-driven approaches exploit this heterogeneity to infer effective models of cortical circuit computation (e.g. Genkin et al. Nature 2025), the power of response diversity to enable inference of mechanistic circuit models is largely unexplored. Within the landscape of cortical circuit models, spiking neuron networks in the balanced state naturally exhibit high levels of response and tuning diversity emerging from their internal dynamics. A statistical theory for this emergent tuning heterogeneity, however, has only been formulated for binary spin models (Vreeswijk & Sompolinsky, 2005). Here we present a formulation of feature-tuned balanced state networks that allows for arbitrary and diverse dynamics of postsynaptic currents and variable levels of heterogeneity in cellular excitability but nevertheless is analytically exactly tractable with respect to the emergent tuning curve heterogeneity. Using this framework, we present a case study demonstrating that, for a wide range of parameters even the population mean response is non-universal and sensitive to mechanistic circuit details. As our theory enables exactly and analytically obtaining the likelihood-function of tuning heterogeneity given circuit parameters, we argue that it forms a powerful and rigorous basis for neural circuit inference.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02979v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The design and application of LLM-based personas in AI companionship is a rapidly expanding but fragmented field, spanning from virtual emotional compan- ions and game NPCs to embodied functional robots. This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applica- tions in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from \"feeling\" to \"thinking and acting\" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.",

In crashes related to distracted driving, over 90% did not involve cellphone use but were related to UI controls. However, many of the existing UI SDV implementations do not consider Drive Distraction and Inattention (DDI), which is reflected in many popular commercial vehicles. This paper investigates the impact of UI designs on driver distraction and inattention within the context of SDVs. Through a survey of popular commercial vehicles, we identify UI features that potentially increase cognitive load and evaluate design strategies to mitigate these risks. This survey highlights the need for UI designs that balance advanced software functionalities with driver-cognitive ergonomics. Findings aim to provide valuable guidance to researchers and OEMs to contribute to the field of automotive UI, contributing to the broader discussion on enhancing vehicular safety in the software-centric automotive era.",

Specifically, the chatbot integrates workflow-based instruction with LLM's planning and reasoning capabilities, enabling it to function as a virtual expert and conduct interviews. We detail the chatbot's features and its implementation. Our preliminary evaluation indicates that the chatbot performs as designed, effectively following predefined workflows and supporting user interactions with areas for improvement. We conclude by discussing the implications of employing chatbots to elicit user information, emphasizing their potential and limitations.",

      "title": "Interview Survey on Attractivenesses of Place Re-creation Toward Developing a Virtual Twin Design Theory",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02840v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: It is often seen that real-world locations are re-created using models, metaverse technology, or computer graphics. Although the surface-level purposes of these re-creations vary, the author hypothesizes that there exists an underlying common attractiveness that remains unclear. This research aims to clarify the attractiveness and its structures of place re-creations through an interview study with qualitative analysis. The interviews used examples of physical re-creations, such as the model in Komazawa University's Zen Culture History Museum and some dioramas of Tokyo, as well as computer-generated re-creations of Shibuya using platforms like Minecraft and Project Plateau's 3D city model. Using insights gained from this investigation, this study seeks to establish a theoretical framework for designing virtual twins.",

      "title": "Evaluating Generative AI as an Educational Tool for Radiology Resident Report Drafting",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02839v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Objective: Radiology residents require timely, personalized feedback to develop accurate image analysis and reporting skills. Increasing clinical workload often limits attendings' ability to provide guidance. This study evaluates a HIPAA-compliant GPT-4o system that delivers automated feedback on breast imaging reports drafted by residents in real clinical settings.\n  Methods: We analyzed 5,000 resident-attending report pairs from routine practice at a multi-site U.S. health system. GPT-4o was prompted with clinical instructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study using 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four residents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error types were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement between GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was measured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.\n  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition of key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and (3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement with attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types. Inter-reader reliability showed moderate variability ({\\alpha} = 0.767, 0.595, 0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect agreement ({\\Delta} = -0.004 to 0.002). GPT's feedback was rated helpful in most cases: 89.8%, 83.0%, and 92.0%.\n  Discussion: ChatGPT-4o can reliably identify key educational errors. It may serve as a scalable tool to support radiology education.",

      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",
