      "title": "Neuron synchronization analyzed through spatial-temporal attention",
      "content": "Neuronal synchronization refers to the temporal coordination of activity across populations of neurons, a process that underlies coherent information processing, supports the encoding of diverse sensory stimuli, and facilitates adaptive behavior in dynamic environments. Previous studies of synchronization have predominantly emphasized rate coding and pairwise interactions between neurons, which have provided valuable insights into emergent network phenomena but remain insufficient for capturing the full complexity of temporal dynamics in spike trains, particularly the interspike interval. To address this limitation, we performed in vivo neural ensemble recording in the primary olfactory center\u2014the antennal lobe (AL) of the hawk moth Manduca sexta\u2014by stimulating with floral odor blends and systematically varying the concentration of an individual odorant within one of the mixtures. We then applied machine learning methods integrating modern attention mechanisms and generative normalizing flows, enabling the extraction of semi-interpretable attention weights that characterize dynamic neuronal interactions. These learned weights not only recapitulated the established principles of neuronal synchronization but also facilitated the functional classification of two major cell types in the antennal lobe (AL) [local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs)]. Furthermore, by experimentally manipulating the excitation/inhibition balance within the circuit, our approach revealed the relationships between synchronization strength and odorant composition, providing new insight into the principles by which olfactory networks encode and integrate complex sensory inputs.",

      "title": "Modeling cognition through adaptive neural synchronization: a multimodal framework using EEG, fMRI, and reinforcement learning",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive process of thinking as a neural phenomenon remains a central challenge in neuroscience and computational modeling. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a biologically grounded framework that simulates adaptive decision making across cognitive states.MethodsThe model integrates neuronal synchronization, metabolic energy consumption, and reinforcement learning. Neural synchronization is simulated using Kuramoto oscillators, while energy dynamics are constrained by multimodal activity profiles. Reinforcement learning agents\u2014Q-learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN)\u2014modulate external inputs to maintain optimal synchrony with minimal energy cost. The model is validated using real EEG and fMRI data, comparing simulated and empirical outputs across spectral power, phase synchrony, and BOLD activity.ResultsThe DQN agent achieved rapid convergence, stabilizing cumulative rewards within 200 episodes and reducing mean synchronization error by over 40%, outperforming Q-learning in speed and generalization. The model successfully reproduced canonical brain states\u2014focused attention, multitasking, and rest. Simulated EEG showed dominant alpha-band power (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), while real EEG exhibited beta-dominance (3.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124\u202fa.u.), indicating accurate modeling of resting states and tunability for active tasks. Phase Locking Value (PLV) ranged from 0.9806 to 0.9926, with the focused condition yielding the lowest circular variance (0.0456) and a near significant phase shift compared to rest (t\u202f=\u202f\u22122.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.075). Cross-modal validation revealed moderate correlation between simulated and real BOLD signals (r\u202f=\u202f0.30, resting condition), with delayed inputs improving temporal alignment. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis of simulated BOLD data showed high region-specific prediction accuracy (R2\u202f=\u202f0.973\u20130.993, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), particularly in prefrontal, parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. Voxel-wise correlation and ICA decomposition confirmed structured network dynamics.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that the framework captures both electrophysiological and spatial aspects of brain activity, respects neuroenergetic constraints, and adaptively regulates brain-like states through reinforcement learning. The model offers a scalable platform for simulating cognition and developing biologically inspired neuroadaptive systems.ConclusionThis work provides a novel and testable approach to modeling thinking as a biologically constrained control problem and lays the groundwork for future applications in cognitive modeling and brain-computer interfaces.",

      "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
      "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

      "title": "Advancements in the application of multimodal monitoring and machine learning for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies in traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "Trauma is the fourth leading cause of death globally and the primary cause of mortality in the 15\u201345 age group, with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at the core of trauma care. Annually, over 50 million TBI patients are reported worldwide. The complex and heterogeneous pathophysiology of TBI presents substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. In recent years, multimodal monitoring has emerged as a crucial tool to guide clinical management. The integration of multimodal monitoring with machine learning offers novel opportunities for TBI assessment and management, given the rapid development and widespread application of machine learning approaches. Therapeutic hypothermia has shown potential neuroprotective benefits in experimental and clinical contexts, though evidence remains mixed and its implementation in practice faces significant challenges. This review summarizes recent advancements in multimodal monitoring and explores how machine learning can optimize the application of therapeutic hypothermia in conjunction with multimodal data. For example, predictive models trained on multimodal signals (e.g., EEG, ICP, cerebral blood flow, and oxygenation) can help identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from targeted temperature management. By enabling such stratification and adaptive treatment strategies, machine learning may support the development of more personalized and effective therapeutic approaches for TBI.",

      "content": "IntroductionDisorders of consciousness (DoC), including unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), are primarily diagnosed behaviorally. Recent evidence indicates that loss of consciousness manifests as irregularities in neural oscillatory activity across delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. However, conventional spectral analysis often conflates periodic oscillations with aperiodic 1/f components, potentially obscuring consciousness-related dynamics.MethodsTo elucidate the mechanistic basis of spectral alterations in consciousness impairment, we compared oscillatory and aperiodic activity patterns in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of patients with different consciousness levels. We further examined the spatiotemporal variability of these neural signatures and rigorously evaluated their discriminative power for state classification using support vector machine (SVM) analysis.ResultsWhile periodic and aperiodic activities are independent, our results indicate that both components exhibit significant differences between groups at both local and global scales. Critically, higher spatial and temporal variability of aperiodic features (spectral exponent) were correlated with preserved consciousness. When distinguishing UWS from MCS, the combination of periodic and aperiodic features significantly improved classification performance compared to using either metric alone.DiscussionOur findings demonstrate that both periodic oscillations and aperiodic activity provide valuable information about consciousness levels. Critically, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the aperiodic component serve as a key marker of brain state. This underscores the necessity of accounting for aperiodic activity in mechanistic studies and clinical assessments of DoC.",

      "title": "Patient-specific and interpretable deep brain stimulation optimisation using MRI and clinical review data",
      "content": "BackgroundOptimisation of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) settings is a key aspect in achieving clinical efficacy in movement disorders, such as the Parkinson\u2019s disease. Modern techniques attempt to solve the problem through data-intensive statistical and machine learning approaches, adding significant overhead to the existing clinical workflows. Here, we present a geometry-based optimisation approach for DBS electrode contact and current selection, grounded in routinely collected MRI data, well-established tools (Lead-DBS) and optionally, clinical review records.MethodsThe pipeline, packaged in a cross-platform tool, uses lead reconstruction data and simulation of Volume of Tissue Activated (VTA) to estimate the contacts in optimal position relative to the target structure, and suggests optimal stimulation current. The tool then allows further interactive user optimisation of the current settings. Existing electrode contact evaluations can be optionally included in the calculation process for further fine-tuning and adverse effect avoidance.ResultsBased on a sample of 174 implanted electrode reconstructions from 87 Parkinson\u2019s disease patients, we demonstrate that our algorithm\u2019s DBS parameter settings are more effective in covering the target structure (Wilcoxon p\u202f<\u202f5e-13, Hedges\u2019 g\u202f>\u202f0.94) and minimising electric field leakage to neighbouring regions (p\u202f<\u202f2e-10, g\u202f>\u202f0.46) compared to expert parameter settings. Retrospective analysis of a limited subset (n\u202f=\u202f50) predicts comparable improved motor outcomes with expert settings (g\u202f=\u202f0.05\u20130.08, p\u202f=\u202f0.09\u20131), suggesting potential for similar clinical efficacy, pending prospective validation.ConclusionThe proposed automated method for optimisation of the DBS electrode contact and current selection shows promising results and is readily applicable to existing clinical workflows. We demonstrate that the algorithmically selected contacts perform better than manual selections according to electric field calculations, without the iterative optimisation procedure.",

      "content": "De novo CSNK2B variants are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and early-onset epilepsy, yet in vivo therapeutic evidence and translatable biomarkers remain limited. We generated Csnk2b haploinsufficient (Csnk2b+/-) mice that recapitulate core clinical features: ASD-like social and cognitive deficits, heightened anxiety, spontaneous seizures, cortical and hippocampal structural compromise, and reduced PV-interneuron density with impaired cortical inhibition. Neonatal brain-wide AAV-PHP.eB-mediated CSNK2B replacement (hsyn or CAG promoters, retro-orbital P3) restored cortical/hippocampal structure, normalized neuronal numbers, prolonged survival, and ameliorated seizures and ASD-like behaviors with comparable efficacy across promoters. Critically, treatment also corrected quantitative EEG signatures that are directly deployable in human trials: theta and gamma band power were normalized, theta/gamma (and beta/gamma) ratios recovered, and inter-areal coherence and gamma-band effective connectivity were restored, indicating re-established excitation/inhibition balance and large-scale network coordination. These EEG endpoints constitute a compact, noninvasive biomarker panel of target engagement and physiological efficacy that can be harmonized with clinical EEG to support dose finding, early decision-making, and longitudinal monitoring in CSNK2B gene-therapy trials. Together, our data provide preclinical proof-of-concept that early AAV-mediated CSNK2B replacement is therapeutically effective and nominate band-limited EEG metrics as translational readouts to accelerate first-in-human studies for CSNK2B-linked neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",
