      "content": "arXiv:2511.14013v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As a capability coming from computation, how does AI differ fundamentally from the capabilities delivered by rule-based software program? The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.",

      "title": "Affective Color Scales for Colormap Data Visualizations",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.13979v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Here we ask how AI agent \"personalities\" interact with human personalities, and other traits, to shape human-AI collaboration, productivity and performance. To estimate these relationships, we conducted a large-scale preregistered randomized experiment that paired 1,258 participants with AI agents that were prompted to exhibit varying levels of the Big Five personality traits. These human-AI teams produced 7,266 display ads for a real think tank, and the quality of these ads was evaluated by 1,995 independent human raters as well as in a field experiment conducted on X, which generated nearly 5 million impressions. We found, first, that personality pairing impacted teamwork quality. For example, neurotic AI improved teamwork for agreeable humans but impaired it for conscientious humans. Second, we found productivity effects of personality pairing and a \"productivity-performance trade-off\" in which certain pairings (e.g., agreeable human with neurotic AI) produced fewer ads but of higher quality. Third, personality pairing influenced ad quality and performance. For example, quality improved when open humans were paired with conscientious AI and when conscientious humans were paired with disagreeable AI. Some of these pairing effects were \"jagged\" in that they varied across text and visual tasks. For example open humans produced higher quality images but lower quality text when paired with agreeable AI. Pairing effects were also present in other human traits, like country of origin. For example, extroverted AI improved quality for Latin American workers, but degraded quality for East Asian workers. These findings demonstrate that human-AI personality alignment significantly improves collaboration, productivity, and performance and lay a foundation for future research on improving human-AI collaboration through AI personalization.",

AR has the potential to support and enhance industrial maintenance processes in these aspects. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to study and explore how advanced technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), AR and speech processing can be integrated to support hands-free, real-time task logging and interaction in maintenance environments. This is done by developing a demonstrator for Microsoft HoloLens 2 using Unity, C#, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Functions, which enables speech-to-text transcription for hands-free maintenance support. Using Azures' speech recognition, the demonstrator can achieve high transcription accuracy in an AR environment, facilitating natural interactions between users and the augmented environment.

In particular, the production phase offers unique potential for the integration of such AI-based solutions. These AI-based solutions assist site managers, project engineers, coordinators and other key roles in making final decisions. To facilitate the decision-making process in the production phase of construction through a human-centric AI-based solution, it is important to understand the needs and challenges faced by the end users who interact with these AI-based solutions to enhance the effectiveness and usability of these systems. Without this understanding, the potential usage of these AI-based solutions may be limited. Hence, the purpose of this research study is to explore, identify and describe the key factors crucial for developing AI solutions in the construction industry. This study further identifies the correlation between these key factors. This was done by developing a demonstrator and collecting quantifiable feedback through a questionnaire targeting the end users, such as site managers and construction professionals.

      "content": "arXiv:2403.20239v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Objective Accurate identification of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the early neonatal period is essential for initiating therapeutic hypothermia (TH) within 6 hours of birth to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes. We aimed to develop a simple decision-making tool for identifying term neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) based on features of conventional electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded within 6 hours of birth. Methods EEG recordings from 100 full-term neonates with HIE were graded by pediatric neurologists for severity. Amplitude in slow frequency bands was analyzed, focusing on delta (0.5-4 Hz) spectral power. Temporal fluctuations of delta power characterized each HIE grade, with joint level and duration probability densities estimated for delta oscillation power. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gouv (NCT05114070). Results These 2D EEG representations effectively distinguish mild HIE cases from those requiring hypothermia, achieving 98% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 99% positive predictive value, 94% negative predictive value, an F1 score of 99%, and a false alarm rate of only 6%. This system accurately discriminates mild from moderate or severe HIE, with only one mild case mistakenly identified as requiring hypothermia and one moderate case erroneously flagged for treatment. Conclusions Quantized probability densities of delta spectral features from early EEG (within 6 hours of birth) revealed significant differences between mild and moderate/severe HIE, enabling accurate discrimination of candidates for TH. Significance Simple, interpretable biomarkers from early EEG can provide an efficient visual clinical decision support tool to identify full-term neonates with HIE eligible for therapeutic hypothermia.",

      "title": "THD-BAR: Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling for EEG Generic Representations",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.13733v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large-scale pre-trained models hold significant potential for learning universal EEG representations. However, most existing methods, particularly autoregressive (AR) frameworks, primarily rely on straightforward temporal sequencing of multi-channel EEG data, which fails to capture the rich physiological characteristics inherent to EEG signals. Moreover, their time-centered modeling approach also limits the effective representation of the dynamic spatial topology of brain activity. To address these challenges and fully exploit the potential of large-scale EEG models, we propose a novel Topology Hierarchical Derived Brain Autoregressive Modeling (THD-BAR) for EEG generic representations. The core innovation of THD-BAR lies in the introduction of the Brain Topology Hierarchy (BTH), which establishes a multi-scale spatial order for EEG channels. This hierarchical structure enables a redefinition of autoregressive learning as a \"next-scale-time prediction\" problem, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Based on BTH, we design a Topology-Hierarchical Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (THVQ-VAE) for multi-scale tokenization and develop an enhanced Brain Autoregressive (BAR) module with specialized masking strategies for prediction. Through extensive large-scale pre-training on 17 datasets, followed by rigorous validation on 10 downstream datasets spanning 5 distinct tasks, THD-BAR consistently outperforms existing methods. These results highlight the superior generalization and modeling capabilities of our proposed approach.",

However, progress in DecNef research remains constrained by subject-dependent learning variability, reliance on indirect measures to quantify progress, and the high cost and time demands of experimentation.\n  We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning.\n  We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation.\n  In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.",

Simulations confirmed dopamine facilitates movement via thalamic disinhibition. Analysis of its impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) revealed a complex, region-specific outcome: SNR increased in some regions (e.g., D2 Striatum: 3.41 dB to 6.25 dB), decreased in others (e.g., Thalamus VL: 6.24 dB to 3.93 dB), and remained stable elsewhere (e.g., M1: 3.16 dB to 3.13 dB). This heterogeneity stems from dopamine increasing the excitability of D1-receptor-expressing neurons, which amplifies channel conductance noise and reduces SNR in specific circuits. Thus, dopamine acts not as a uniform signal enhancer, but as a complex modulator that critically balances facilitation and noise within the CSTC loop.",

      "title": "Multi-network Topology Underlying Individual Language Learning Success",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14453v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adult language learning varies greatly among individuals. Traditionally associated with frontotemporal language regions, this variability is increasingly seen as stemming from distributed brain networks. However, the role of these networks and their topological organization in explaining these differences remains unclear. We hypothesize that graph-theory-based network analysis of intrinsic multimodal connectivities across multiple networks explains overall and component-specific variations in language learning. We tested this in 101 healthy adults who underwent resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging before seven days of six artificial language training tasks. We identified one dominant general learning component shared across tasks and five task-specific ones. Cross-validated predictive models used multimodal multi-network graph-theoretic metrics to predict final learning outcomes (LO) and rates (LR). We significantly predicted the LO and LR of the general component, which were primarily contributed by dorsal attention and frontoparietal networks. Nodal local efficiency was the most consistent predictor, with additional contributions from node clustering coefficient and network centrality for LR, highlighting local robustness, mesoscale network segregation, and global influence in explaining individual differences. Only task-specific word learning LO was predictable, relying on default mode and frontoparietal hubs with high betweenness centrality and efficiency. These findings demonstrate that intrinsic network topologies underlie differences in language learning success, supporting a multiple-systems hypothesis in which attentional-control networks interact with default and subcortical systems to shape learning trajectories. This advances mechanistic understanding and paves the way for personalized language education.",

This paper introduces Visionary Co-Driver, a system that leverages large language models to identify non-collision roadside risks and alert drivers based on their eye movements. Specifically, the system combines video processing algorithms and LLMs to identify potentially risky road users.

Rather than adopting a qualitative or empirical approach, the paper develops a conceptual integration of insights from HRM, human-computer interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies. The analysis highlights that although algorithmic systems can enhance operational efficiency, they risk reinforcing biases and narrowing the relational and contextual dimensions of work. These systems often overlook intangible contributions such as creativity, empathy, and collaborative problem solving, revealing gaps in data-driven performance measurement. In response, the study proposes a sociotechnical perspective on algorithmic accountability that emphasizes procedural transparency, organizational justice, and employee agency. By revisiting foundational questions within the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic management, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the future of work and the design of managerial technologies that support, rather than constrain, human autonomy and organizational life.",

      "title": "A Longitudinal Study on the Attitudes of Gay Men in Beijing Towards Gay Social Media Platforms: Lonely Souls in the Digital Concrete Jungle",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14174v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Over the past decade, specialized social networking applications have become a cornerstone of life for many gay men in China. This paper employs a longitudinal mixed-methods approach to investigate how Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM) have shifted their attitudes toward these platforms between approximately 2013 and 2023. Drawing on archival analysis of online discourses, a quantitative survey of 412 participants, and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 32 participants, we trace the complex trajectory of this evolution. Our findings reveal a clear pattern: from the initial embrace of these applications as revolutionary tools for community building and identity affirmation (2014--2017), to a period of growing ambivalence and critique centered on commercialization, ``hookup culture,'' and multiple forms of discrimination (2017--2020), and finally to the present era (2020--2023), characterized by pragmatic, fragmented, yet simultaneously critical and reconstructive uses. Today, users strategically employ a repertoire of applications -- including global platforms (e.g., Grindr and Tinder), domestic mainstream platforms (e.g., Blued), and niche alternatives (e.g., Aloha) -- to fulfill differentiated needs. We develop a detailed temporal framework to capture this attitudinal evolution and discuss its design implications for creating more supportive, secure, and community-oriented digital environments for marginalized groups.",

      "title": "Final Happiness: What Intelligent User Interfaces Can Do for the lonely Dying",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14164v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study explores the design of Intelligent User Interfaces (IUIs) to address the profound existential loneliness of terminally ill individuals. While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has made inroads in \"Thanatechnology,\" current research often focuses on practical aspects like digital legacy management, overlooking the subjective, existential needs of those facing death in isolation. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The \"Three Pillars, Twelve Principles\" framework for designing IUIs as \"Existential Companions\"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness. This research provides a clear, user-centered path for designing technology that serves not as a \"tool for dying,\" but as a \"partner for living fully until the end\".",

      "title": "Gamified Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Mysophobia: Evaluating the Efficacy of a Simulated Sneeze Intervention",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.14118v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mysophobia, or the fear of germs, is a prevalent anxiety disorder that significantly impacts daily life. This study investigates the potential of a gamified virtual reality (VR) intervention to simulate contamination-related scenarios and assess their emotional and psychological effects. A VR game based sneeze simulation was developed to evaluate its influence on participants' emotional states. Seven participants completed two versions of the game: a baseline version and an experimental version featuring the sneeze simulation. Emotional responses were measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - State (STAI-S) questionnaires. The results revealed slight increases in negative affect and anxiety levels during the sneeze simulation. Also, a reduction in positive affect was revealed. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). This is likely due to small sample sizes, a lack of grossness in the simulation, or participants not being clinically mysophobes. This exploratory study highlights the potential of VR-based interventions for understanding and addressing contamination-related anxieties. It provides a foundation for future research with larger and more diverse participant pools.",

      "title": "Whole-Brain Millisecond-Scale Effective Connectivity Atlas of Auditory and Visual Naming",
      "content": "Neurobiological models suggest that speech relies on interactions among distant cortical regions interconnected by white matter pathways. Prior studies have shown that speech-related functional coactivation--simultaneous high-gamma augmentation across distributed regions--reflects underlying neural interactions, as validated by electrical stimulation mapping. However, it remains unclear at the whole-brain level when, for how long, and in which directions cortical regions transmit information, and how dynamic information flows contribute to speech. Here, we investigated the causal roles of directional neural information flow during auditory and visual naming using intracranial EEG from 9,526 artifact-free nonepileptic sites across 127 patients. Information flow, estimated by transfer entropy-based effective connectivity, was classified as excitatory when high-gamma acceleration in one region predicted subsequent acceleration in another, and inhibitory when deceleration predicted downstream deceleration. Following stimulus onset, excitatory flows emerged from modality-specific sensory cortices and propagated to higher-order regions, later becoming bidirectional as functional coactivation developed. Each excitatory flow event was transient (<500 ms), typically followed by inhibitory flows and decreased coactivation, during which excitatory flows often emerged along new pathways. During auditory naming, faster response times were associated with stronger excitatory flows in left perisylvian regions; during visual naming, faster responses were linked to stronger flows in bilateral basal temporal cortices. Stronger excitatory flows at specific time points predicted a higher probability of stimulation-induced symptoms (Spearman's rho: 0.54 - 0.81; p<0.00001), whereas associations with inhibitory flows peaked later. Excitatory flows near visual naming response onset were particularly associated with stimulation-induced speech arrest and face sensorimotor symptoms, whereas functional coactivation alone failed to reveal comparable associations. These findings demonstrate that transient acceleration of directional neural interactions through white matter supports successive stages of speech processing. As activity within one pathway decelerates, excitatory flow accelerates along another, enabling functional transitions critical for naming. By establishing the causal contribution of temporally precise, anatomically specific white matter pathways, this study substantiates and extends existing neurobiological models of speech. To facilitate replication and dynamic whole-brain visualization, we provide open access to the full dataset (62.15 GB) and analysis code.",

      "title": "Neural mechanisms of handedness for precision drawing: hand-dependent engagement of cortical networks for bimanual control and tool use",
      "content": "The neural mechanisms of handedness remain poorly understood, particularly for lateralized movements such as precision drawing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined how healthy adults and individuals with peripheral nerve injury (PNI) in their dominant hand performed a visually guided drawing task with each hand. We hypothesized that the left superior parietal lobule (SPL) supports drawing with either hand, and that individuals with PNI would recruit the same mechanisms as healthy adults. Methods: 33 Right-handed adults (23 healthy adults, 10 patients) underwent fMRI while performing a precision drawing task, alternating between the right hand (RH) and left hand (LH). LH>RH effects were examined across 20 regions of interest (12 a priori, 8 post hoc) using two approaches: (1) BOLD magnitude, and (2) functional connectivity (FC) modulation, assessed via generalized psychophysiological interaction. Results: All effects describe LH drawing > RH drawing. Right primary motor cortex (M1) had lower magnitude and greater FC with two networks, both of which exhibited equal-or-greater magnitude: a left hemisphere M1-dorsal premotor circuit, and an intrahemispheric parieto-temporal circuit. Right M1 (also had reduced interhemispheric FC with inferior parietal lobule, which exhibited lower magnitude. Patient group had no effect on magnitude or FC. Conclusions: Three neural mechanisms differentiate LH from RH drawing in right handed adults. First, a left hemisphere system for bimanual control, which engages intrahemispherically (directly) during RH drawing but interhemispherically (indirectly) during LH drawing. Second, LH drawing increases engagement of a contralateral system that may reflect increased task demands. Third, RH drawing increases engagement of an interhemispheric circuit for tool use. The first and third systems may explain performance asymmetries associated with handedness. Patients with PNI use the same mechanisms as healthy adults, highlighting these mechanisms' potential as a neuromodulatory target to enhance LH performance after RH impairment.",
