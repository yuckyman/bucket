It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Graded regulation of microtubule-binding of Tau by the phosphorylation state of the proline-rich region in living neurons",
      "content": "Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal morphology and axonal transport. While phosphorylation is known to regulate Tau-microtubule interactions, the contribution of specific phosphorylation patterns in situ remains poorly understood due to the complexity of the intracellular environment. In this study, we combined fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons with dephosphorylation-mimetic mutations and computational modeling to analyze the effects of phosphorylation on Tau-microtubule interaction. We particularly focused on the proline-rich region, of which phosphorylation has been studied in physiological and pathological perspectives, and generated a dephosphorylation-mimetic Tau mutant by substituting key phosphorylation sites with alanine residues and compared its microtubule-binding dynamics to those of WT-Tau in FRAP experiments. Experimental data, together with simulation-based parameter exploration, revealed that the overall number of phosphorylated sites plays a more dominant role than their specific locations in modulating Tau-microtubule affinity. These findings provide new insights into the post-translational regulation of Tau and establish a computational-experimental framework for interrogating intracellular protein dynamics.",

      "title": "Excessive activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway triggers adult-onset motor axonal degeneration",
      "content": "Axonal and synaptic degeneration are key hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we performed an unbiased forward genetic mosaic screen to identify genes required for maintenance of adult motor axons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the Drosophila leg. We identified 49 mutations in 30 genes, including mutations in 8 genes resulting in adult-onset progressive degeneration. We found that loss of pebbled (peb) function results in adult-onset motor axonal and NMJ degeneration, and age-dependent motor deficits. Peb is the Drosophila RREB1 ortholog, a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that negatively regulates transcription of RAS/MAPK pathway target genes. Loss of peb function resulted in excessive RAS/MAPK pathway activation, and loss of function of other negative regulators of the RAS/MAPK pathway also induced adult-onset progressive NMJ degeneration and motor deficits. Importantly, treatment of adult flies with the MEK1/2 inhibitor mirdametinib induced a dosage-dependent rescue of peb mutant motor neurodegenerative phenotypes. Thus, RAS/MAPK pathway overactivation results in adult-onset progressive neurodegeneration, which can be prevented by RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition.",

      "content": "Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. However, tools to image glutamate dynamics in the whole brain with high spatial and temporal resolution are lacking. Therefore, we developed GluTrooper, a novel mouse line engineered for inducible and long-lasting expression of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR3. GluTrooper mice crossed with Emx1-Cre lines demonstrated uniform and stable sensor expression in excitatory neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. iGluSnFR3 expression remained stable for at least 12 months, enabling longitudinal observations of glutamate dynamics over extended periods. Using multimodal imaging in awake mice, we demonstrated the versatility of GluTrooper across multiple spatial scales: from mesoscale widefield cortical imaging to cellular resolution with two-photon microscopy. Moreover, during cortical spreading depolarization, bilateral whole-brain glutamate dynamics and contralateral cortical disinhibition were detected with high fidelity. Accordingly, the GluTrooper may open new avenues for the better understanding of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the mammalian brain.",
