      "title": "The Somatostatin Pathway Projected from the Basal Forebrain to the Lateral Habenula Promotes Isoflurane Anesthesia Recovery",
      "content": "<p>The basal forebrain (BF) acts as a pivotal relay station in the transmission of arousal signals, projecting to both cortical and subcortical structures. Among its downstream targets is the lateral habenula (LHb), which recent research has implicated in the modulation of sleep rhythms and in mediating the loss of consciousness associated with anesthetic agents. In our study, we utilized optogenetic manipulation to selectively modulate the BF<sup>VGluT2/SOM</sup> neuron projection pathway to the LHb, thereby examining its impact on behavioral and electroencephalographic responses to isoflurane anesthesia. Our results demonstrated that in healthy adult male mice, the activation of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway significantly prolonged the induction time of anesthesia and shortened recovery time, consequently diminishing the anesthetic potency of isoflurane and reducing EEG <i></i> power. In contrast, the inhibition of this pathway yielded the inverse effects. Notably, modulation of the BF<sup>VGluT2</sup>-&gt;LHb projection pathway did not significantly affect the induction or recovery times of isoflurane anesthesia. Employing optogenetics in conjunction with calcium signal recording, we elucidated that the arousing effect of the BF<sup>SOM</sup>-&gt;LHb pathway is attributable to the enhanced inhibitory action of BF<sup>SOM</sup> neurons on LHb<sup>Glu</sup> neurons. This discovery sheds new light on the neural circuits involved in the loss and recovery of consciousness induced by anesthetic drugs, potentially informing future therapeutic strategies.</p>",

      "title": "Stopping Muscle Contractions and Relaxations during Action Inhibition Involves Global and Targeted Control Dependent on Muscle State",
      "content": "<p>The mechanisms underpinning the stopping of muscle contractions and relaxations during action inhibition remain unclear. Central stop commands may be targeted and act on task-active muscles only, or instead be global, acting on task-passive muscles as well. We addressed this question in three stop signal task experiments with human participants (<i>n</i> = 54; 18 male, 36 female). While maintaining baseline force levels (10% MVC) in both index fingers, Go signals required participants to increase or decrease this force in the task-active finger (Task-active Contract vs Task-active Relax) while keeping activity in the task-passive muscle constant. On 30% of trials, delayed stop signals instructed participants to stop the task-active responses. Stop-related activity was detected in task-active muscles at the single trial level, using electromyography (EMG), and used to determine whether stop-related activity was also present in task-passive muscles. We found that stop commands act on both task-active and task-passive muscles, suggesting global control. This global control was furthermore muscle state specific, by decreasing muscle activity when stopping contractions and increasing muscle activity when stopping relaxations. However, stopping muscle contractions involved more sustained suppression of muscle activity in task-active than task-passive muscles, suggesting additional targeted control. This was not the case when stopping muscle relaxations, which only showed evidence of global control. Our results may explain how complex, real-world actions are inhibited. Global stop commands that are sensitive to muscle state may rapidly adjust muscle activity across the body, with additional control targeted to contracting, task-active muscles.</p>",

      "title": "Beta and High Gamma Oscillations in the Cortico-striatal Network Reflect Reward Certainty on a Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task",
      "content": "<p>Behavioral outcomes are rarely certain, requiring subjects to discriminate between available choices by using feedback to guide future decisions. Probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) tasks test subjects&rsquo; ability to learn and flexibly adapt to changes in reward contingencies. Cortico-striatal circuitry has been broadly implicated in flexible decision-making&mdash;though what role these circuits play remains complicated. In this study we leveraged the fast temporal dynamics of local field potentials to precisely identify the role that cortico-striatal networks play during PRL reward feedback. We measured widespread (32-CH) local field potential activity of male Long&ndash;Evans rats during a PRL task wherein a target response delivered reward on 80% of trials while a non-target response delivered reward on 20% of trials. When subjects learned those reward probabilities, contingencies were reversed. We found that reward-evoked oscillations at beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) and high gamma (&gt;70&nbsp;Hz) frequencies marked positive reward valence and reflected probability of reward. Activity and connectivity at beta frequencies between orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum during expected rewards were correlated with behavioral performance and specific aspects of value/exploitative behavior as defined by a reinforcement learning computational model. Finally, we found that modulating beta activity in orbitofrontal cortex with optogenetic (20&nbsp;Hz) stimulation promoted maladaptive behavior when stimulation was provided during non-target responses, consistent with our data and computational model predictions. Reward-evoked beta oscillations may reflect a crucial component underlying reward learning, and erroneous elevations in this physiological signal may contribute to maladaptive task performance and behavioral disruptions.</p>",

      "title": "Mechanisms of Long-Term Nonexternally Reinforced Preference Change: Functional Connectivity Changes in a Longitudinal Functional MRI Study",
      "content": "<p>Behavioral change studies mostly focus on external reinforcements to modify preferences. Cue-approach training (CAT) is a paradigm that influences preferences by the mere association of stimuli, sensory cues, and a rapid motor response, without external reinforcements. The behavioral effect has been shown to last for months after less than 1&nbsp;h of training. Here, we used a modified version of CAT by changing the neutral-cue to a number that represented a monetary amount of reward that the participants accumulate (i.e., incentive-cue). After a single training session, we compared behavioral performance and functional connectivity (FC), as measured by resting-state scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging, between two groups (total of 107 males and females in both groups), one receiving a neutral-cue and the other receiving an incentive-cue, at five time points across 1&nbsp;year. We replicated the maintenance of behavioral changes after 6&nbsp;months for the nonexternally reinforced neutral-cue participants, but not for the reinforced group. The reinforced training group showed higher FC within the limbic system, whereas the nonexternally reinforced group showed higher functional connectivity within and between default mode and dorsal attention networks. Our findings offer putative neural correlates for both reinforced and nonexternally reinforced preference changes that are maintained over time and which could be implemented in future behavioral change interventions.</p>",

      "title": "PolyQ-Expansion of Ataxin-2 Disrupts Microtubule Stability and Impairs Axon Outgrowth",
      "content": "<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by mislocalization and aggregation of proteins in motor neurons. Ataxin-2 (ATXN2), an RNA-binding protein harboring 22-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeats, is a risk factor for ALS, when its polyQ repeats are expanded to 27&ndash;33 repeats. However, the physiological function of ATXN2 beyond its role in RNA regulation and how polyQ expansion in ATXN2 increases risk for ALS remain unclear. We previously demonstrated that <i>Drosophila</i> Atx2 functions as a regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics in motor neurons. Here, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying Atx2-mediated MT regulation and how polyQ expansion disrupts its function, using a mixed-sex population of <i>Drosophila</i> as a model system. Specifically, we show that Atx2 requires its RNA-binding Lsm domain to regulate MTs. Notably, the LSM domains of human ATXN2 rescue MT phenotype in <i>Drosophila</i>, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved role of ATXN2 in MT regulation. Importantly, we find that polyQ-expanded ATXN2 forms cytoplasmic aggregates and leads to excessive MT destabilization. Additionally, polyQ expansion severely impairs axon outgrowth. Finally, we identify uncoordinated-76 (UNC-76/FEZ1) as a downstream effector of Atx2 in MT regulation and neuronal development.</p>",

      "title": "Disrupted Calcium Dynamics in Reactive Astrocytes Occur with End Feet-Arteriole Decoupling in an Amyloid Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "<p>While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two-photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake 7- to 8-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multicell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte end feet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, end feet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared with WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte end feet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiologic communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is an important neuronal hub that integrates external sensory inputs and information about internal states to regulate a range of innate and learned behaviors, including fear learning and memory. Prior studies, leveraging robust fear conditioning assays, have delineated detailed circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and recall of fear memories. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in the CeA remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the clock output molecule mWAKE/ANKFN1 within the CeA of male mice in fear learning and memory. mWAKE is expressed in multiple neuronal subclusters in the lateral CeA. Surprisingly, mWAKE levels do not exhibit rhythmic expression in the CeA. In line with this observation, expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL also does not cycle in the CeA. Consistent with prior studies, loss of mWAKE function increases intrinsic excitability of CeA neurons. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of mWAKE and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>mWAKE</sup> neurons impair fear learning and memory. Finally, we show that mWAKE levels in a subset of CeA neurons are reduced following fear conditioning. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism modulating the activity and function of CeA neurons in fear learning and memory.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>",

      "content": "IntroductionIdentification and treatment of neurological disorders depend much on brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision support. Although they are loud, do not remain in one spot, and are rather complex, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the principal tool used in research of brain function. This work employs an Adaptive Transformer-based technique with improved attention processes to extract temporal and spatial relationships in EEG data, effectively addressing these issues.MethodsFirst processed to eliminate noise and split them into time-series chunks, EEG data are then included into the proposed approach. Channel-wise embeddings and temporal encoding help to depict the data. Then, a transformer design including spatial attention for inter-channel interactions, multi-head self-attention for temporal aspects, and an adaptive attention mask for domain-specific modifications is used. Other openly accessible EEG datasets as well as the TUH EEG Corpus and CHB-MIT were evaluated against the model. Its performance was scored using metrics like accuracy, precision, memory, and F1-score.ResultsThe suggested method was more accurate than standard models like CNNs and LSTMs, with a score of 98.24%. The method was also shown to be able to find minor patterns in EEG data by improving precision and memory. Attention maps showed important areas of time and space, which made them easier to understand and useful in professional settings.DiscussionThe Adaptive Transformer turns out to be a useful tool for neurotherapeutic use of EEG data modeling. The approach provides greater medical assistance and knowledge on the functioning of the brain as well as answers significant issues. Future research might focus on subject-specific modifications and interaction with real-time systems.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in revolutionizing EEG analysis for precision brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision-making.",
