      "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

      "title": "Clinical study of wearable low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment in the improvement of executive function in obesity (the SLITE trial): protocol for a single -centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "IntroductionObesity is a global health crisis associated with significant physical and cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function. Impaired executive function exacerbates unhealthy eating behaviors and hinders effective weight management. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated potential in improving executive function and assisting in weight reduction but face limitations in accessibility and efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) represents an emerging neuromodulation technique distinguished by its non-invasive application and superior spatial resolution, facilitating targeted modulation of cortical activity and neural excitability with high precision. This study aims to explore the efficacy of LIPUS on executive function in obesity.Methods and analysisThis study adopts a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled design. A total of 44 participants diagnosed with obesity (BMI \u2265 28 kg/m2) will be enrolled and equally assigned to the LIPUS and sham groups. The LIPUS group will receive pulsed therapeutic ultrasound for 4 weeks, while the sham group will receive placebo treatment using a device delivering no therapeutic ultrasound. Both groups will undergo assessments at baseline and after 4 weeks, with the primary outcome being the change in reaction time on the food Go/No-go task. Secondary outcomes include changes in body weight, BMI, food cravings (measured by the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait and State versions), food-eating behavior (measured by the Visual Analog Scale and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire), and cognitive performance as assessed by the Stroop test. Additional neuroimaging assessments will include functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG).DiscussionThis trial will be the first to evaluate LIPUS for enhancing executive function in individuals with obesity. By combining wearable ultrasound technology with neuroimaging assessments, the study is expected to provide novel evidence for the neuromodulatory role of LIPUS. The results may support the development of innovative, non-invasive strategies for obesity management and inform future clinical applications.",

      "title": "From early symptoms to EEG silence: tracking the neurodegenerative course of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease",
      "content": "BackgroundSporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. Early diagnosis remains challenging due to nonspecific initial symptoms. Although electroencephalography (EEG) is a key diagnostic tool, particularly through the detection of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs), the longitudinal evolution of EEG features and their correlation with clinical and neuroimaging progression are not fully characterized.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study analyzed 37 patients diagnosed with probable and very probable sCJD according to the 2021 Chinese diagnostic guidelines. All patients underwent at least one EEG examination. One representative patient was followed for 23\u202fweeks with serial EEG and MRI studies to document dynamic electrophysiological and structural changes. EEG background activity was graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and PSWCs were identified based on standardized criteria. MRI analyses focused on the spatial and temporal progression of hyperintense lesions on DWI and FLAIR sequences.ResultsAmong the 37 patients, 46% underwent initial EEG within 1\u202fmonth of symptom onset, and 49% exhibited severe background abnormalities. PSWCs were present in 84% of patients at first EEG, with a high prevalence (82%) even in those examined within 4\u202fweeks of onset. Longitudinal analysis in the index case revealed a progressive EEG deterioration: from slowed and disorganized background rhythms and emerging triphasic waves at 8\u202fweeks, to widespread PSWCs with increasing periodicity (9\u201316\u202fweeks), and finally to a burst-suppression pattern near electrical silence by week 23. Concurrent MRI showed a parallel expansion of hyperintense lesions from unilateral cortical and basal ganglia regions to bilateral involvement, closely correlated with the EEG progression. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between survival time and age, time to first EEG, CSF 14\u20133-3 protein status, or initial EEG background grade. Furthermore, neither the presence of typical PSWCs nor the severity of background activity was associated with survival outcomes.ConclusionEEG, especially the early and highly prevalent presence of PSWCs, offers high diagnostic value in sCJD but does not serve as prognostic predictors. The close correlation between EEG decline and MRI progression supports multimodal monitoring. Serial EEG should be integrated into sCJD diagnosis and follow-up.",

      "content": "Reinforcement learning (RL) models explain how people adapt behavior through incremental value updates, but assume that individual experiences are not explicitly stored or retrieved. Across two experiments (N=282 and N= 1,818), we tested whether people rely on such explicit memory representations during experience-based choice. Participants sampled outcomes from two lotteries and, in an \"ignore\" condition, were instructed to disregard specific outcomes before deciding. Ignoring these outcomes substantially altered preferences, suggesting that choices were guided by explicit episodic representations rather than cumulative reinforcement. Frequency judgments revealed generally accurate memory for experienced outcomes, but reduced precision for continuous compared with discrete outcome distributions. These findings challenge purely incremental RL accounts and support theories proposing that human choice integrates flexible episodic memory with reinforcement mechanisms, bridging models of learning, memory, and decision-making.",

      "title": "Impaired Peri-infarct Long-Term Potentiation Suggests Alternative Mechanisms of Post-stroke Recovery in Rats",
      "content": "Background: Early after stroke, a period of heightened plasticity in the peri-infarct cortex is thought to provide the physiological substrate for functional motor recovery through increased expression of long-term potentiation (LTP). Prior slice electrophysiology studies on the capacity for LTP after stroke reported conflicting results. Slice preparation could have influenced the results by disrupting neuromodulatory processes altered after stroke. Therefore, whether LTP can be induced in the peri-infarct cortex remains to be elucidated. We investigated LTP in the peri-infarct cortex of anesthetized rats using a novel in vivo method that preserves local and long-range circuit dynamics. Methods: LTP, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity were assessed under urethane anaesthesia in 15 rats (11 with focal stroke to the primary motor cortex, and 4 sham operated controls). Rats were tested one or two weeks after stroke using a minimally perturbed in vivo LTP induction protocol validated in naive rats. Motor function was evaluated using the cylinder test at baseline and at one or two-weeks post stroke. Results: LTP in the peri-infarct cortex was supressed in the stroke group compared to sham controls. In addition, synaptic transmission was reduced for higher stimulation intensities, and short-term plasticity shifted from facilitation to depression, indicating impaired synaptic function at one- and two-weeks post-stroke. Behaviorally, the lesioned rats exhibited motor deficits at one week but showed full recovery by two weeks post-stroke. Conclusion: In recovering animals, both LTP and synaptic transmission are profoundly impaired in the peri-infarct cortex. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than LTP- based plasticity underlie motor recovery during this stage.",

      "title": "Visualization and Morphological Analysis of Individual Oligodendrocytes in the Mouse White Matter",
      "content": "Myelin formation by oligodendrocytes is essential for the regulation of the conduction velocity and proper brain function. To ensure accurate information processing in response to experiences such as sensory stimuli and learning, oligodendrocytes adjust their number and morphology. In addition, oligodendrocyte morphology changes with senescence and in the presence of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, visualizing oligodendrocytes and analyzing their morphology is crucial for understanding how our brains change under such conditions. Herein, we describe the methods for labeling and analyzing the morphologies of individual oligodendrocytes in mouse white matter at the light microscopic level. PDGFRa-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP and PLP-CreERT2:Tau-mGFP mice enable us to visualize and analyze later-born or early-born oligodendrocyte morphology. In addition, sparse oligodendrocyte labeling with attenuated rabies virus expressing GFP enables the visualization and morphological analysis of individual oligodendrocytes in various brain white matter regions without the need for transgenic animals. Furthermore, the combination with immunostaining in thick tissues enables the identification of labeled oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths, as well as their interactions with neuronal axons. These methods are suitable for revealing how oligodendrocytes adapt their morphologies depending on environmental stimuli or pathological conditions.",

      "title": "Integrated analysis implicates novel insights of NMB into lactate metabolism and immune response prediction in primary glioblastoma",
      "content": "Background: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, exhibits profound treatment resistance and poor prognosis. Despite advances in immunotherapy for other cancers, GBM remains refractory, potentially due to its lactate-rich, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While aerobic glycolysis-driven lactate accumulation is known to acidify the TME and impair immune function, the precise mechanisms linking lactate metabolism to immune evasion in GBM remain elusive. Methods: We integrated multi-omics analyses with machine learning to identify - gene signatures associated lactate metabolism (LM) and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Multiple bioinformatic tools were employed to determine the association of key genes with TME remodeling, immunotherapy response and drug sensitivities. Results: Neuromedin B (NMB) emerged as a pivotal regulator of lactate-mediated immunosuppression, correlating strongly with LM and TIDE. We found that NMB expression was remarkably correlated with clinical characteristics, immune response, TME remodeling and drug sensitivities. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that NMB is a key cross-factor in metabolic and immune regulation in GBM. It breaks through the traditional perception that metabolism and immunity are mutually exclusive in cancer by promoting oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism and enhancing anti-tumor immunity through its dual functions. It provides a new direction for the combined intervention of metabolic targeting and immunotherapy, and the strong predictive value of NMB expression for drug response further highlights its clinical application potential in the formulation of personalized treatment strategies for GBM patients.",

To date, the performance of the trim and fill\nmethod has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more\ncomprehensive examination of different versions of the trim and fill method in\na number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those\nfrom usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely\nuse of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in\nthe meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the\nperformance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study\nheterogeneity the trim and fill method can underestimate the true positive\neffect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is\npresent the trim and fill method can give estimates that are less biased than\nthe usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate\nfrom the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach in the\npresence of publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our\nsimulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the\npresence of publication bias use of the trim and fill method can help to reduce\nthe bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not\nideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly\ncaused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the\nperformance of different trim and fill estimators and models in various\nmeta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the trim and fill method as a form\nof sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.2889&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;25&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n17476644&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;4544-4562&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Performance\nof the trim and fill method in the presence of publication bias and\nbetween-study\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;26&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Peters&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jaime\nL.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Sutton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Alex\nJ.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Jones&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;David\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Abrams&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Keith\nR.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Rushton&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Lesley&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2007&quot;,11,10]]}}},{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/DMQP989N&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:264,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;It\nis known that the existence of publication bias can influence the conclusions\nof a meta-analysis. Some methods have been developed to deal with publication\nbias, but issues remain. One particular method called 'trim and fill' is\ndesigned to adjust for publication bias. The method, which is intuitively\nappealing and comprehensible by non-statisticians, is based on a simple and\npopular graphical tool called the funnel plot. We present a simulation study\ndesigned to evaluate the behaviour of this method. Our results indicate that\nwhen the studies are heterogeneous (that is, when they estimate different\neffects), trim and fill may inappropriately adjust for publication bias where\nnone exists. We found that trim and fill may spuriously adjust for non-existent\nbias if (i) the variability among studies causes some precisely estimated\nstudies to have effects far from the global mean or (ii) an inverse\nrelationship between treatment efficacy and sample size is introduced by the\nstudies' a priori power calculations. The results suggest that the funnel plot\nitself is inappropriate for heterogeneous meta-analyses. Selection modelling is\nan alternative method warranting further study. It performed better than trim\nand fill in our simulations, although its frequency of convergence varied,\ndepending on the simulation parameters.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Statistics\nin\nMedicine&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1002/sim.1461&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;0277-6715&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;13&quot;,&quot;journalAbbreviation&quot;:&quot;Stat\nMed&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;note&quot;:&quot;PMID:\n12820277&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;2113-2126&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;PubMed&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Adjusting\nfor publication bias in the presence of\nheterogeneity&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Terrin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Norma&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schmid&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Christopher\nH.&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lau&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Joseph&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Olkin&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ingram&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2003&quot;,7,15]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Peters\net al., 2007; Terrin et al., 2003)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

Specifying a\nrange of values around zero allows researchers to statistically reject the\npresence of effects large enough to matter, and prevents practically\ninsignificant effects from being interpreted as a statistically significant\ndifference. We compare the behavior of the recently proposed second generation\np-value (Blume, D\u2019Agostino McGowan, Dupont, &amp; Greevy, 2018) with the more\nestablished Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) equivalence testing procedure\n(Schuirmann, 1987). We show that the two approaches yield almost identical\nresults under optimal conditions. Under suboptimal conditions (e.g., when the\nconfidence interval is wider than the equivalence range, or when confidence\nintervals are asymmetric) the second generation p-value becomes difficult to\ninterpret. The second generation p-value is interpretable in a dichotomous\nmanner (i.e., when the SGPV equals 0 or 1 because the confidence intervals lies\ncompletely within or outside of the equivalence range), but this dichotomous\ninterpretation does not require calculations. We conclude that equivalence\ntests yield more consistent p-values, distinguish between datasets that yield\nthe same second generation p-value, and allow for easier control of Type I and\nType II error rates.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.933&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Daniel Lakens, Marie Delacre&quot;,&quot;page&quot;:&quot;1-11&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Equivalence\nTesting and the Second Generation\nP-Value&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Lakens&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Dani\u00ebl&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Delacre&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Marie&quot;}],&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,7,13]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Lakens\n&amp; Delacre, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">.

In\nthis article we assume that the overall goal researchers wish to achieve is to\nmaximize the utility gained by conducting the replication study. We then\npropose a general rule for study selection in replication research based on the\nreplication value of the set of claims considered for replication. The\nreplication value of a claim is defined as the maximum expected utility we\ncould gain by conducting a replication of the claim, and is a function of (a)\nthe value of being certain about the claim, and (b) uncertainty about the claim\nbased on current evidence. We formalize this definition in terms of a causal\ndecision model, utilizing concepts from decision theory and causal graph\nmodeling. We discuss the validity of using replication value as a measure of\nexpected utility gain, and we suggest approaches for deriving quantitative\nestimates of replication value.

Replicating\nresearchers will therefore often have to decide which of several relevant\ncandidates to target for replication. Formal strategies for efficient study\nselection have been proposed, but none have been explored for practical\nfeasibility \u2013 a prerequisite for validation. Here we move one step closer to\nefficient replication study selection by exploring the feasibility of a\nparticular selection strategy that estimates replication value as a function of\ncitation impact and sample size (Isager, van 't Veer, &amp; Lakens, 2021). We\ntested our strategy on a sample of fMRI studies in social neuroscience. We\nfirst report our efforts to generate a representative candidate set of\nreplication targets. We then explore the feasibility and reliability of\nestimating replication value for the targets in our set, resulting in a dataset\nof 1358 studies ranked on their value of prioritising them for replication.

Here,\nwe present a comprehensive simulation study in which we examined how some of\nthe most promising meta-analytic methods perform on data that might\nrealistically be produced by research in psychology. We simulated several\nlevels of questionable research practices, publication bias, and heterogeneity,\nand used study sample sizes empirically derived from the literature.

We give exact theoretical results showing\nhow selection for significance affects the distribution of statistical power in\na heterogeneous population of significance tests. In a set of large-scale\nsimulation studies, we compare four methods for estimating population mean\npower of a set of studies selected for significance (a maximum likelihood\nmodel, extensions of p-curve and p-uniform, &amp;amp; z-curve). The p-uniform\nand p-curve methods performed well with a fixed effects size and varying sample\nsizes. However, when there was substantial variability in effect sizes as well\nas sample sizes, both methods systematically overestimate mean power. With\nheterogeneity in effect sizes, the maximum likelihood model produced the most\naccurate estimates when the distribution of effect sizes matched the\nassumptions of the model, but z-curve produced more accurate estimates when the\nassumptions of the maximum likelihood model were not met. We recommend the use\nof z-curve to estimate the typical power of significant results, which has\nimplications for the replicability of significant results in psychology\njournals.&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Meta-Psychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.15626/MP.2018.874&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2003-2714&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Copyright\n(c) 2020 Jerry Brunner, Ulrich\nSchimmack&quot;,&quot;source&quot;:&quot;open.lnu.se&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Estimating\nPopulation Mean Power Under Conditions of Heterogeneity and Selection for\nSignificance&quot;,&quot;URL&quot;:&quot;https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/874&quot;,&quot;volume&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:[{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Brunner&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Jerry&quot;},{&quot;family&quot;:&quot;Schimmack&quot;,&quot;given&quot;:&quot;Ulrich&quot;}],&quot;accessed&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2022&quot;,3,16]]},&quot;issued&quot;:{&quot;date-parts&quot;:[[&quot;2020&quot;,5,31]]}}}],&quot;schema&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/citation-style-language/schema/raw/master/csl-citation.json&quot;}\n<span style='mso-element:field-separator'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">(Brunner\n&amp; Schimmack, 2020)</span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US\nstyle='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-end'></span></span><![endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">It seems a\nbit of a stretch to say the p-curve method did not get scrutiny appropriate to\nits popularity when there were many papers that criticized it, relatively\nquickly </span><!--[if supportFields]><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:\nEN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;LqMzfpTk&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller, 2018)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Aert\net al., 2016; Bishop &amp; Thompson, 2016; Ulrich &amp; Miller,\n2018)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/B8XNF95F&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:1415,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Because\nof overwhelming evidence of publication bias in psychology, techniques to\ncorrect meta-analytic estimates for such bias are greatly needed.

The properties of\np-curves are commonly investigated by computer simulations. On the basis of\nthese simulations, it has been proposed that the skewness of this curve can be\nused as a diagnostic tool to decide whether the significant p values within a\ncertain domain of research suggest the presence of p-hacking or actually\ndemonstrate that there is a true effect. Here we introduce a rigorous\nmathematical approach that allows the properties of p-curves to be examined\nwithout simulations. This approach allows the computation of a p-curve for any\nstatistic whose sampling distribution is known and thereby allows a thorough\nevaluation of its properties. For example, it shows under which conditions\np-curves would exhibit the shape of a monotone decreasing function. In addition,\nwe used weighted distribution functions to analyze how 2 different types of\npublication bias (i.e., cliff effects and gradual publication bias) influence\nthe shapes of p-curves. The results of 2 survey experiments with more than\n1,000 participants support the existence of a cliff effect at p = .05 and also\nsuggest that researchers tend to be more likely to recommend submission of an\narticle as the level of statistical significance increases beyond this p level.\nThis gradual bias produces right-skewed p-curves mimicking the existence of\nreal effects even when no such effects are actually present.

What is fair to say is that\nstatisticians failed to engage with an incredibly important topic (test for\npublication bias) that addressed a clear need in many scientific communities,\nas most of the criticism was by psychological methodologists. I fully agree\nthat statisticians should have engaged more with this technique. I believe the\nreason that they didn\u2019t is because there is a real problem in the reward\nstructure in statistics, where statisticians get greater rewards inside their\nfield by proposing a 12<sup>th</sup> approach to compute confidence intervals\naround a non-parametric effect size estimate for a test that no one uses, than\nto help psychologists solve a problem they really need a solution for. Indeed,\nfor a statistician, publication bias is a very messy business, and there will\nnever be a sufficiently rigorous test for publication bias to get credit from\nfellow statisticians. There are no beautiful mathematical solutions, no\ncreative insights, there is only the messy reality of a literature that is\nbiased by human actions that we can never adequately capture in a model. The\nfact that empirical researchers often don\u2019t know where to begin to evaluate the\nreliability of claims in their publication-bias-ridden field is not something\nstatisticians care about.

Journal peer review will not\nsuffice, because it is only as good as the two or three peers that happen to be\nwilling and available to review a paper. But it is a start. We should enable\nresearchers to see how well papers are peer reviewed by journals. Without\ntransparency, we can\u2019t calibrate our trust </span><!--[if supportFields]><span\nlang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'><span style='mso-element:field-begin'></span><span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0</span>ADDIN ZOTERO_ITEM CSL_CITATION\n{&quot;citationID&quot;:&quot;DuUONcRk&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;formattedCitation&quot;:&quot;(Vazire,\n2017)&quot;,&quot;plainCitation&quot;:&quot;(Vazire, 2017)&quot;,&quot;noteIndex&quot;:0},&quot;citationItems&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:2227,&quot;uris&quot;:[&quot;http://zotero.org/users/371621/items/6IRLDTML&quot;],&quot;itemData&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:2227,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;article-journal&quot;,&quot;abstract&quot;:&quot;Article:\nQuality Uncertainty Erodes Trust in\nScience&quot;,&quot;container-title&quot;:&quot;Collabra:\nPsychology&quot;,&quot;DOI&quot;:&quot;10.1525/collabra.74&quot;,&quot;ISSN&quot;:&quot;2474-7394&quot;,&quot;issue&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;eng&quot;,&quot;license&quot;:&quot;Authors\nwho publish with this journal agree to the following terms:<span\nstyle='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span>Authors retain copyright and grant the\njournal right of first publication with the work simultaneously licensed under\na<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>Creative Commons Attribution\nLicense<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>that allows others to share the\nwork with an acknowledgement of the work's authorship and initial publication in\nthis journal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>Authors are able to enter\ninto separate, additional contractual arrangements for the non-exclusive\ndistribution of the journal's published version of the work (e.g., post it to\nan institutional repository or publish it in a book), with an acknowledgement\nof its initial publication in this journal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\n</span>Authors are permitted and encouraged to post their work online (e.g., in\ninstitutional repositories or on their website) prior to and during the\nsubmission process, as it can lead to productive exchanges, as well as earlier\nand greater citation of published work (See<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0\n</span>The Effect of Open Access ).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>\u00a0 </span>All\nthird-party images reproduced on this journal are shared under Educational Fair\nUse.

Peer reviews should be open, for\nall papers, including papers proposing new statistical methods.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If we want\nour statistical methods to be of high quality, we need to specify quality\nstandards. Morey and Davis-Stober point out the limitations of simulation-based\ntests of a method and convincingly argue for the value of evaluating the\nmathematical properties of a testing procedure. If as a field we agree that an\nevaluation of the mathematical properties of a test is desirable, we should\ntrack whether this evaluation has been performed, or not. We could have a long\nchecklist of desirable quality control standards \u2013 e.g., a method has been\ntested on real datasets, it has been compared to similar methods, those\ncomparisons have been performed objectively based on a well-justified set of\ncriteria, etc. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One could\ncreate a database where for each method the quality standards that have been\nmet and that have not been met are listed. If considered useful, the database\ncould also track how often a method is used, by tracking citations, and listing\npapers that have implemented the method (as opposed to those merely discussing\nthe method). When statistical methods become widely used, the database would point\nresearchers to which methods deserve more scrutiny. The case of magnitude-based\ninference in sport science reveals the importance of a public call for scrutiny\nwhen a method becomes widely popular, especially when this popularity is\nlimited to a single field. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The more\ncomplex methods are, the more limitations they have. This will be true for all\nmethods that aim to deal with publication bias, because the way scientists bias\nthe literature is difficult to quantify. Maybe as a field we will come to agree\nthat tests for bias are never accurate enough, and we will recommend people to\njust look at the distribution of p-values without performing a test. Alternatively,\nwe might believe that it is useful to have a testing procedure that too often\nsuggests a literature contains at least some non-zero effects, because we feel\nwe need some way to intersubjectively point out that there is bias in a\nliterature, even if this is based on an imperfect test. Such discussions\nrequire a wide range of stakeholders, and the opinion of statisticians about\nthe statistical properties of a test is only one source of input in this\ndiscussion. Imperfect procedures are implemented all the time, if they are the\nbest we have, and doing nothing is also not working. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Statistical\nmethods are rarely perfect from their inception, and all have limitations. Although\nI understand the feeling, banning all tests that have not been adequately vetted\nby an expert is inherently unscientific. Such a suggestion would destroy the\nvery core of science \u2013 an institution that promotes mutual criticism, while\naccepting our fallibility.
