      "title": "Information, Movement and Adaptation in Human Vision",
      "content": "Our eyes are never still. Even when fixating, they exhibit small, jittery motions. While it has long been argued that these fixational eye movements (FEMs) aid the acquisition of visual information, a complete theoretical description of their impact on the information available in the early visual system has been lacking. Here we build FEMs into a minimal theoretical model of the early visual response, including the critical process of adaptation (a fading response to a fixed image). We establish the effect of FEMs on the mutual information between a visual stimulus and this response. Our approach identifies the key dimensionless parameters that characterise the effect of fixational eye movements, and reveals the regimes in which this effect can be beneficial, detrimental or negligible. Taking parameter values appropriate for human vision, we show that the spatio-temporal couplings induced by fixational eye movements can explain the qualitative features of the human contrast sensitivity function as well as classic experiments on temporal integration. To our knowledge, the consideration of fixational eye movements in this latter context is novel, and our results suggest the need for future experiments to determine the mechanisms by which spatial and temporal responses are coupled in the human visual system.",

      "title": "Sleep Deprivation Primes Synaptic Vulnerability Without Inducing Oxidative Damage: A Mechanistic Reappraisal",
      "content": "The question of whether sleep deprivation is inherently lethal has remained unresolved due to the inability to separate pure sleep loss from experimental stress. Historical studies dating back over a century have consistently reported that prolonged wakefulness leads to death, but these findings have been confounded by the stressful nature of the experimental interventions used to maintain wakefulness. Recent work has suggested that sleep deprivation-induced lethality may result from accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intestines, providing a potential molecular explanation for these long-standing observations. Here we address whether lethality stems from sleep loss itself or experimental stress using stress-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila and stress paradigms in both flies and mice. Using real-time feedback-controlled sleep deprivation in Drosophila -- which only stimulates animals when they attempt to sleep -- we found no lethality or intestinal ROS accumulation even after 240 hours of continuous wakefulness. In contrast, both physical perturbation and psychological challenges rapidly induced intestinal ROS accumulation independent of sleep loss, in flies and mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed entirely distinct molecular signatures between sleep deprivation and oxidative stress, demonstrating these represent fundamentally different biological challenges. However, while sleep deprivation alone caused no lethality or intestinal oxidative stress, it increased susceptibility to traumatic brain injury through enhanced synaptic strength. Sleep-deprived flies showed increased mortality when subjected to violent physical challenges, an effect that correlated with synaptic excitability rather than sleep duration, and was rescued by restorative recovery sleep or prevented in mutants lacking synaptic potentiation mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that experimental stress, not sleep loss, drives the oxidative damage and lethality historically attributed to sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation, however, creates conditional vulnerability by transforming the brain into a hyperexcitable state susceptible to trauma, rather than causing cumulative damage.",
