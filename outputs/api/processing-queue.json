      "title": "Peripheral phoneme encoding and discrimination in aging and hearing impairment",
      "content": "Speech perception difficulties in noise are common among older adults and individuals with hearing impairment, even when audiometric thresholds appear normal. We examined how aging, cochlear synaptopathy (CS), and outer hair cell (OHC) damage affect speech encoding and phoneme discrimination. Envelope-following responses (EFRs) to rectangular amplitude-modulated (RAM) tones and speech-like phoneme pairs were recorded in quiet using EEG, and behavioral discrimination was assessed in quiet, ipsilateral, and contralateral noise. Stimuli were designed to target temporal envelope (TENV) or temporal fine structure (TFS) encoding. Results showed that RAM-EFR amplitudes decreased gradually with age, consistent with emerging CS, while magnitudes of high-frequency TENV-based EFRs in quiet were most reduced in older hearing-impaired listeners with combined CS and OHC damage. In contrast, EFRs targeting low-frequency TENV encoding in quiet remained preserved. Behaviorally, phoneme discrimination of TFS contrasts worsened with OHC loss and age in quiet and contralateral noise, respectively, while there was no significant effect of age on the discrimination of TENV contrasts. Considering that high-frequency contrasts are discriminated via place-based spectral cues, low-frequency contrasts rely on TFS, and the EFR reflects primarily TENV, this framework explains why EFRs decline for high-frequency cues without perceptual loss, while EFRs remain stable for low-frequency cues even as TFS-based discrimination deteriorates. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into how neural coding deficits relate to perceptual outcomes. Combining electrophysiological and behavioral measures might provide a sensitive framework for detecting subclinical auditory deficits to earlier diagnose age-related and hidden hearing loss.",

      "content": "Diurnal rhythms in brain transcription align neural, immune, and metabolic processes with the light-dark cycle and are profoundly disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the regional organization of diurnal transcription in the healthy and diseased brain remains poorly defined. Using large-scale spatial transcriptomics, we mapped 24-hour rhythmic transcription across cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. We identified marked regional differences in rhythmicity, including distinct oscillatory signatures across cortical areas and along the rostro-caudal axis. In the APP23 mouse model of AD, pathology-vulnerable brain regions exhibited early, region-specific disruption of diurnal transcription prior to substantial amyloid plaque deposition. These findings reveal a spatially organized architecture of brain diurnal rhythms and identify early rhythmic dysregulation as a feature of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.",

      "title": "Tunable Tau Expression in C. elegans Neurons Reveals that Early-AD Tau Phosphorylation Selectively Impacts Behavior and Mitochondrial Quality Control",
      "content": "Tau protein accumulates myriad post-translational modifications as Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses, and early-disease tau modifications such as phosphorylation at threonine 231 (T231) likely play a key role in AD pathogenesis. Here, a series of \"tunable tau\" strains was developed in C. elegans to test the relative impact of tau pseudo-phosphorylation of T231 (T231E) compared to protein expression level as a driver of phenotypic penetrance and severity. Multiple copies of a cassette coding for pan-neuronal wildtype tau or T231E were inserted at a genomic safe harbor loci to create a repertoire of strains expressing tau from low to high levels. In stereotypical behavioral assays of locomotory activity, T231E selectively impacted phenotypic severity compared to wild-type human tau controls, which further tracked with age and tau expression level. However, deficits in associative memory were non-selective between tau and T231E. Moreover, genetic, pharmacologic, and molecular approaches indicated that mitophagy modulation could suppress T231E phenotypes. Additionally, a robust mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) occurred in T231E, and loss of atfs-1, a transcription factor central to the UPRmt suppressed T231E toxicity. These results demonstrate that phenotypic severity is invariably associated with tau dosage, while early-AD relevant modifications can be causative drivers of selective deficits. Consistent with recent findings, enhancing mitophagy or suppressing potentially maladaptive consequences of persistent UPRmt induction can be beneficial. This provides a solid foundation for further interrogation into mitochondrial quality control disruption as a potential root cause for AD pathogenesis.",

      "content": "Prey, predators or conspecifics are first detected as visual objects in seeing animals. Vision guides behavioral actions towards or away from these objects. An error in this visual perception could prove fatal. How object information is untangled to avoid errors remains unclear. Here we show that LC10d visual projection neurons in Drosophila melanogaster mediate avoidance of visual objects devoid of a chemosensory profile. LC10d neurons are broadly tuned to objects and project to same retinorecipient brain region that receives inputs from LC10a neurons, which are required for tracking. The descending neurons DNa10 are directly downstream of the anterior-looking LC10d sub-population and mediate LC10d-dependent avoidance. Our work demonstrates the use of two similar neuron types and chunking of the visual field as strategies to disentangle similar sets of visual cues. Discrete objects are avoided until chemosensory information is gathered to enable decision making on whether to engage in social interactions or rather to avoid them.",

      "content": "Systemic hypertension is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, yet the mechanistic basis connecting the two conditions remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that hypertensive rats develop accelerated retinal degeneration characterized by retinal thinning, functional impairment, reduced perfusion, and progressive neuroinflammation. Critically, these changes occur despite persistently lower intraocular pressure (IOP), indicating an IOP-independent mechanism of pathology. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses identified a robust activation of the retinal endothelin system, with endothelin-2 (EDN2) being the earliest and most significantly upregulated component. AAV-delivered retinal Edn2 knockdown completely restored retinal function, ameliorated neuroinflammation, and enhanced retinal blood flow in hypertensive rats. Pharmacological blockade of endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), but not type B, replicated these protective effects without altering IOP. Our findings establish EDN2 as a central, IOP-independent driver of hypertension-associated retinal neurodegeneration and identify the endothelin-EDNRA axis as a potential therapeutic target to prevent vision loss in hypertensive patients.",

      "content": "Modern digital environments expose the brain to a dense stream of personally meaningful cues that differ markedly from the conditions under which sensory systems evolved. Understanding how the brain responds and adapts to such environments is increasingly relevant for cognitive and mental well-being. In this study, we used auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a task-irrelevant auditory oddball paradigm to obtain a time-resolved account of neural responses to smartphone notifications. We dissociated the effects of generic notification sounds from the learning-related effects of personalized notification sounds, and examined how these responses varied across levels of smartphone use. Among early stages of processing, generic tones exhibited experience-dependent strengthening of auditory representations, whereas personalized tones engaged stable, pre-learned representations, as reflected in P2 dynamics. The strongest stimulus-dependent modulation was observed in pre-attentive salience detection, reflected in the mismatch negativity (MMN), which was earlier and larger for personalized tones compared to generic ones. At later stages, attentional orienting and extended evaluative processing showed distinct patterns that were differentially sensitive to stimulus identity and smartphone use. Notably, smartphone usage levels modulated later attentional and evaluative stages (P3a and LPP) without altering early pre-attentive prediction-error signaling. Overall, our findings demonstrate that personalized smartphone notifications do not uniformly increase neural distraction. Instead, they engage robust and rapid pre-attentive prediction-error signaling that is largely independent of usage, while habitual smartphone use selectively shapes later attentional orienting and evaluative dynamics.",
