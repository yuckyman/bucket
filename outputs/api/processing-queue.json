      "title": "A Pilot Study on Fabric-Based Pneumatic Soft Gloves for Assisting Patients With Severe Brachial Plexus Injury",
      "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

      "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
      "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "title": "Learning Spatial Awareness for Laparoscopic Surgery with AI Assisted Visual Feedback",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02233v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Laparoscopic surgery constrains surgeons spatial awareness because procedures are performed through a monocular, two-dimensional (2D) endoscopic view. Conventional training methods using dry-lab models or recorded videos provide limited depth cues, often leading trainees to misjudge instrument position and perform ineffective or unsafe maneuvers. To address this limitation, we present an AI-assisted training framework developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim that couples the standard 2D laparoscopic feed with synchronized three-dimensional (3D) visual feedback delivered through a mixed-reality (MR) interface. While trainees operate using the clinical 2D view, validated AI modules continuously localize surgical instruments and detect instrument-tissue interactions in the background. When spatial misjudgments are detected, 3D visual feedback are displayed to trainees, while preserving the original operative perspective. Our framework considers various surgical tasks including navigation, manipulation, transfer, cutting, and suturing. Visually similar 2D cases can be disambiguated through the added 3D context, improving depth perception, contact awareness, and tool orientation understanding.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02133v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Designing multi-functional alloys requires exploring high-dimensional composition-structure-property spaces, yet current tools are limited to low-dimensional projections and offer limited support for sensitivity or multi-objective tradeoff reasoning. We introduce AlloyLens, an interactive visual analytics system combining a coordinated scatterplot matrix (SPLOM), dynamic parameter sliders, gradient-based sensitivity curves, and nearest neighbor recommendations. This integrated approach reveals latent structure in simulation data, exposes the local impact of compositional changes, and highlights tradeoffs when exact matches are absent. We validate the system through case studies co-developed with domain experts spanning structural, thermal, and electrical alloy design.",

      "title": "NeuResonance: Exploring Feedback Experiences for Fostering the Inter-brain Synchronization",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.02079v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When several individuals collaborate on a shared task, their brain activities often synchronize. This phenomenon, known as Inter-brain Synchronization (IBS), is notable for inducing prosocial outcomes such as enhanced interpersonal feelings, including closeness, trust, empathy, and more. Further strengthening the IBS with the aid of external feedback would be beneficial for scenarios where those prosocial feelings play a vital role in interpersonal communication, such as rehabilitation between a therapist and a patient, motor skill learning between a teacher and a student, and group performance art. This paper investigates whether visual, auditory, and haptic feedback of the IBS level can further enhance its intensity, offering design recommendations for feedback systems in IBS. We report findings when three different types of feedback were provided: IBS level feedback by means of on-body projection mapping, sonification using chords, and vibration bands attached to the wrist.",

      "title": "A Single-Equation Approach to Classifying Neuronal Operational Modes",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.01386v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The neural coding is yet to be discovered. The neuronal operational modes that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving {\\it in vivo} stimulation, we show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients ($\\beta_i$) that capture the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological behavior, such as channelopathies.",
