      "title": "An adaptive transformer-based framework for advanced brain activity mapping and intelligent neurotherapeutic decision support",
      "content": "IntroductionIdentification and treatment of neurological disorders depend much on brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision support. Although they are loud, do not remain in one spot, and are rather complex, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the principal tool used in research of brain function. This work employs an Adaptive Transformer-based technique with improved attention processes to extract temporal and spatial relationships in EEG data, effectively addressing these issues.MethodsFirst processed to eliminate noise and split them into time-series chunks, EEG data are then included into the proposed approach. Channel-wise embeddings and temporal encoding help to depict the data. Then, a transformer design including spatial attention for inter-channel interactions, multi-head self-attention for temporal aspects, and an adaptive attention mask for domain-specific modifications is used. Other openly accessible EEG datasets as well as the TUH EEG Corpus and CHB-MIT were evaluated against the model. Its performance was scored using metrics like accuracy, precision, memory, and F1-score.ResultsThe suggested method was more accurate than standard models like CNNs and LSTMs, with a score of 98.24%. The method was also shown to be able to find minor patterns in EEG data by improving precision and memory. Attention maps showed important areas of time and space, which made them easier to understand and useful in professional settings.DiscussionThe Adaptive Transformer turns out to be a useful tool for neurotherapeutic use of EEG data modeling. The approach provides greater medical assistance and knowledge on the functioning of the brain as well as answers significant issues. Future research might focus on subject-specific modifications and interaction with real-time systems.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in revolutionizing EEG analysis for precision brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision-making.",

      "content": "The expanding scale and complexity of functional brain image datasets require space-time analytics. Spacetime concordance (STC) meets this need through an adaptive and robust framework optimized for high-speed analysis. At the core of STC, the Regional Functional Affinity (RFA) metric quantifies functional diversity and uniformity in primate connectomes using wakeful fMRI. This data-driven optimization achieves considerably faster processing, becoming broadly relevant to comparative neuroscience applications. We validated this approach using large-scale datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 1,003) and the NIH Marmoset Brain Mapping Project (N = 26). Results demonstrate striking correspondence between parcellation boundaries of HCP atlas and functional heterogeneity, with boundary lines consistently aligning with regions of low RFA values. In humans, higher-order association networks exhibited lower RFA values indicating functional diversity, while primary sensorimotor networks displayed higher RFA values reflecting uniformity. Cross-species analysis revealed evolutionary conservation of this organizational principle alongside species-specific adaptations. The RFA metric successfully bridges discrete parcellation schemes and continuous models of brain function, offering new insights into primate brain organization and evolution.",

      "title": "Beyond the straight path: high-density laminar recordings in the ventral hippocampus with curved microprobes",
      "content": "Brain function is governed by neural circuits distributed across an intricate, three-dimensional landscape of anatomically complex structures. Current methods for monitoring neural activity are limited to investigating structures that lie along a single, linear trajectory. While this approach is effective for columnar regions, such as dorsal cortical areas or the relatively planar dorsal hippocampus, it fails in deep or curved structures, like the ventral hippocampus, where a linear probe can only achieve with difficulty the combination of physical access and perpendicular orientation required for recordings across all layers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a multisite microelectrode array with a pre-formed curved geometry, engineered to align perpendicularly with neuronal layers in deep anatomical targets regardless of their orientation. This interface integrates a polymer-based array, featuring 16 PEDOT:BF4-coated microelectrodes for robust signal acquisition, with a dissolvable silk stiffener for precise surgical insertion. The resulting device exhibited excellent electrical properties (avg. impedance 18 k{Omega}) and enabled accurate placement across the distinct neuronal layers of the ventral hippocampus CA1 region. These capabilities allowed for successful recordings of both local field potentials and single-unit activity from this region, providing a powerful new tool to investigate the network dynamics of previously inaccessible neural circuits.",

      "title": "Flexible gaze reinstatement during working memory for natural scenes",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) representations may be more action-oriented and anatomically widespread than previously assumed. For instance, oculomotor signatures like gaze biases can reflect spatial WM content. However, the specificity and functional relevance of such signatures is unclear. Here, we tracked eye gaze during WM for naturalistic images, and manipulated which image features were most task-relevant (visual or semantic). In two experiments, we found that the eyes carried out item-specific spatiotemporal gaze sequences during WM maintenance, retracing the scanpath from stimulus encoding. Therefore, gaze patterns during WM track the identity of complex, natural images held in mind. Moreover, the degree of such WM gaze reinstatement was stronger when the task prioritized visual detail, and ramped up in anticipation of the test probe. Oculomotor WM signals are therefore malleable to when and how the content will be used, indicating that distributed WM representations are prospectively-oriented and functionally flexible to situational needs.",
