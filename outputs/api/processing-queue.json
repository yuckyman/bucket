      "title": "Persistent Adaptation through Dual-Timescale Regulation of Ion Channel Properties",
      "content": "Neurons are terminally differentiated cells that adapt to maintain stable function over years, despite encountering a wide range of environmental perturbations. Some adaptations are transient, fading once the perturbation ends. Others are persistent, continuing to influence a neuron's responses to future challenges even after baseline conditions are restored. These persistent adaptations are especially intriguing because some remain undetectable under normal conditions -- only becoming apparent upon re-exposure to a perturbation. Among the many mechanisms that may contribute to persistent adaptation, we investigate one based on the regulation of intrinsic currents. Using a computational model of activity-dependent homeostasis, we show that slow changes in channel density can encode the influence of past experience and shape future responses while rapid shifts in ion channel voltage-dependence provide immediate compensation during perturbations. Together, these dual processes tune a neuron's intrinsic excitability, enabling persistent adaptation.",

      "title": "Mediodorsal Thalamic Input to Striatum Contributes to Early Action Learning",
      "content": "<p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Trans-synaptic Interaction with mGluR6 Contributes to ELFN1 Presynaptic Enrichment in Rod Photoreceptors",
      "content": "<p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>",

      "title": "Convergence and Segregation of Excitatory and Inhibitory Afferents in the Paraventricular Thalamic Nucleus",
      "content": "<p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",
