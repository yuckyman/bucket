This application would be a custom HR solution for candidate profile and job match. I\u2019ve some programming experience in language similar to JavaScript but not in Java script or Python. I started with Python ( thanks google gemini lol) and so far it took me through python 3, fastapi and jinja2. Before I start to deep dive and spend more time learning these I was wondering if this is the right tech stack. It appears the JS, React and Node JS are more popular? Appreciate your valuable inputs and time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/webdev231\"> /u/webdev231 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4yatj/tech_stack_advice_for_a_mvp_web_app/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4yatj/tech_stack_advice_for_a_mvp_web_app/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Molecular signatures of maladaptive plasticity in the amygdala in a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain",
      "content": "Chronic pain, a complex multidimensional disorder, remains a major health care issue and a therapeutic challenge. Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain condition that results from damage or dysfunction in the nervous system. While mechanisms of neuropathic pain at the peripheral and spinal cord level have been extensively studied, pain mechanisms in the brain remain underexplored. The amygdala, a limbic brain region, has emerged as a critical brain area for the emotional-affective dimension of pain and pain modulation. Amygdala neuroplasticity has been associated with pain states, but exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these states and the transition from acute to chronic pain are not well understood. Here, we used the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain in male rats to investigate changes in gene expression in the amygdala at the chronic pain stage using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Two amygdala nuclei, basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA), were investigated in a hemisphere-dependent manner. We used an integrative approach that focuses on functional significance and cell type specificity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to nominate mechanistic targets for central regulation of chronic pain. Our integrative transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses identified individual genes (e.g., Cxcl10, Cxcl12, Mbp, Plp1, Mag, Mog, Slc17a6, Gad1, Sst), molecular pathways (e.g., cytokine-mediated signaling pathway), biological processes (e.g., myelination, synaptic transmission), and specific cell types (e.g., oligodendrocytes, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurons) affected by chronic pain. Our results also provide evidence for the emerging concept of hemispheric lateralization of pain processing in the amygdala. Overall, our study proposes oligodendrocyte dysfunction in the amygdala, neuroimmune signaling in CeA, and glutamatergic neurotransmission in BLA as mechanistic determinants of and potential therapeutic targets for the management of chronic neuropathic pain.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "title": "Neuro-metabolic pathways of high-protein meal reducing food craving",
      "content": "Across species, high-protein foods have been shown to reduce appetite throughout the day. Although higher protein intake alters multiple metabolic responses, the exact neuro-metabolic mechanisms underlying food craving remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether a protein-rich diet modulates plasma tyrosine dynamics, the precursor of dopamine, thereby altering dopaminergic brain activity and reducing food craving in humans. In this within-subject, cross-over study, 30 healthy participants (age, Mean=23.63, SD=3.23 years) were provided with either a high- or low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast. Three and a half hours after breakfast, participants viewed high-or low caloric food images while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their subjective food craving was assessed using the validated Food Craving Questionnaire- State version. Through the experimental procedure, plasma tyrosine levels were continuously monitored. Our results show that the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast significantly enhanced plasma tyrosine levels, which were negatively associated with subjective food craving several hours after meal intake. Importantly, we observed significantly stronger midbrain activity following the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, which was associated with greater reduction in subjective food craving. Furthermore, we analyzed brain gradients that characterize spatial patterns of large-scale neural activity, allowing us to examine the entire process underlying dietary choices at the whole-brain level. Compared with the low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast reduced whole-brain functional reorganization, indicating lower neural sensitivity to high- versus low-caloric food stimuli. Notably, the degree of this high-protein/carbohydrate induced brain-state shift was related to the reduction in food craving. Together, these results provide strong evidence that high-protein/carbohydrate meals modulate dopaminergic mechanisms and large-scale whole-brain neural reorganization, contributing to reduced food craving throughout the day in humans.",

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",
