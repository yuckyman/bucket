      "title": "Task-similarity dependent reconfiguration of compositional modules and geometry in frontal cortex",
      "content": "Task rules critically shape how neural populations encode information and generalize across cognitive demands, yet the mechanisms linking rule structure, neural dynamics, and behavior remain poorly understood. Here we investigate how rule congruence modulates neural-ensemble compositionality, geometry and cross-task generalizability in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM). Mice switched between tactile and auditory delayed-response tasks where sensory-motor contingencies were either aligned (congruent) or conflicting (incongruent). Recording from 11,000 ALM neurons revealed rule dependent compositional coding of stimulus, choice, and outcome. In contrast to congruent switching, incongruent rules reduced cross-task generalizability of sensory, choice and outcome representations, expanded population dimensionality, increased reliance on nonlinear mixed-selectivity, and produced more complex coding geometry. These neural changes paralleled behavioral costs during task transitions. Moreover, congruence dependent reconfiguration of sensory-choice subspaces in ALM predicted differences in transition costs, implicating ALM in adaptively resolving conflicting contingencies. Together, these results show that task congruence regulates neural coding geometry and population dynamics, linking rule-switching complexity to dimensionality of neural resource allocation and to cognitive flexibility.",

      "title": "Splicing of a core clock gene regulates seasonal adaptations by a winter gating mechanism",
      "content": "Seasons bring changes to the environment. Many organisms adjust their physiology and behavior in response to seasonal changes in order to survive. Although the molecular mechanisms mediating the integration of seasonal cues are still unclear, the working model indicates the involvement of the circadian clock. Notably, the circadian neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), an output of the circadian clock, has been shown to alter its expression and activity in response to seasonal changes to facilitate seasonal adaptations in insects. Here, we show that the alternative splicing (AS) of a circadian clock gene, timeless (tim), regulates the seasonal responses of PDF signaling in Drosophila melanogaster. We first showed that tim-sc, the predominant isoform in winter, is regulated by photoperiod in addition to temperature, while the expression of the canonical tim-l isoform is primarily sensitive to temperature. We then demonstrated that tim-sc maintains physiology and behavior in a winter lock state by modulating PDF. At the cellular and molecular level, TIM-SC behavior difers from the canonical TIM-L. Interestingly, flies expressing tim-sc did not fully phenocopy wild-type flies reared in winter conditions, suggesting that other mechanisms are at play in regulating seasonal adaptations, despite the importance of tim AS.",
