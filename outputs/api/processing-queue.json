      "title": "EEG Dynamics of Movement Preparation and Error Processing Distinguish Motor Adaptation From De Novo Learning",
      "content": "Previous research has distinguished behavioral mechanisms between motor adaptation and de novo learning. However, electroencephalography (EEG) markers dissociating them remain unclear. Here, participants (N = 32, 13 female) performed center-out reaching under a 30{degrees} fixed rotation (adaptation), mirror reversal (de novo learning), or random rotation (errors without learning), while we recorded EEG during movement preparation and post-movement feedback. We explored how perturbation type, training phase, and error magnitude shaped neural dynamics in both temporal and frequency domains. During preparation, the readiness potential (RP) showed opposite training-related modulation in the fixed and random rotations, suggesting increased reliance on updated internal models for adaptation. Mirror reversal training showed no RP change, likely reflecting reliance on effortful, explicit learning. Interestingly, we found that Lateralized Readiness Potentials (LRPs) reflected planned movement direction rather than effector-specific preparation. In the frequency domain, beta attenuation for large errors and alpha synchronization for small errors were more pronounced in the fixed rotation than in the mirror reversal, suggesting greater error-sensitivity during adaptation. During post-movement feedback, P3 amplitude decreased from early to late learning in the fixed and random rotations but remained stable in the mirror reversal, highlighting differences in cognitive demands across perturbations. A sustained late positivity emerged following small errors across perturbations, potentially indexing implicit learning. Random rotations also elicited distinct frontal and central beta modulation, likely reflecting disengagement due to task unpredictability. Together, we show that preparatory and feedback-related EEG signatures differ across perturbation types, revealing distinct neural mechanisms underlying motor adaptation and de novo learning.",

      "title": "The effect of sex on sleep EEG in typical and altered neurodevelopment",
      "content": "Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) patterns exhibit complex variations influenced by multiple factors, including sex. While sex effects in sleep neurophysiology are relatively well described in adults, evidence in pediatric populations is more limited, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we analyzed a large pediatric clinical dataset to examine sex differences in whole-night sleep EEG among children without NDDs (N=1523, 2.5-17.5 years) and those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N=196), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, N=523), and intellectual disabilities (IntDis, N=167). Medical record analysis revealed limited sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. Using the open-source package Luna, we extracted a broad range of sleep EEG features (435 in total) and found that 25% of all tested metrics showed significant sex differences in the non-NDD sample with the majority replicated in an independent population-based pediatric cohort. Non-NDD boys exhibited more fragmented sleep compared to girls, but this pattern was not observed among children with NDDs. In contrast, fast spindle density was lower in boys regardless of NDD diagnosis, which may contribute to males' increased susceptibility to developing NDDs. No sex differences were observed in EEG-based brain age predictions. Several sleep EEG metrics showed nominal group-by-sex interactions with ASD and ADHD girls displaying more pronounced alterations, pointing to a varying degree of sleep disturbance. Overall, our findings demonstrate that many sleep EEG features exhibit significant sex differences during childhood, but these differences may be distinct in NDD populations. The sex-specific sleep alterations in NDDs underscore the importance of including both sexes in future research.",

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "The Psychedelic Psilocin Suppresses Activity of Central Amygdala Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor 1 Neurons and Decreases Ethanol Drinking in Female Mice",
      "content": "<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a highly prevalent disorder with limited therapeutic options. The central amygdala (CeA) is a critical brain region as dysregulation within the CeA and the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system are associated with AUD pathology. CeA CRF1 receptors regulate alcohol drinking and have served as a therapeutic target in alcohol treatment. One emerging potential therapeutic for AUD is psilocybin. Psilocybin has been shown to decrease drinking in some clinical studies; however, the effects are variable and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Psilocybin engages many brain regions, including the CeA, and may produce therapeutic effects on drinking through interactions with CeA CRF1 neurons. The current study explores the effects of psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, on voluntary ethanol drinking and CeA CRF1 activity to understand potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psilocin. Psilocin acutely decreased ethanol consumption in mice exposed to two different models of chronic ethanol exposure without producing changes in locomotor behavior. Psilocin increased CeA activation and decreased relative CRF1 activation in CeA subregions from ethanol-naive female CRF1:GFP mice. These results were also observed in chronic ethanol-exposed mice at 24 and 72&nbsp;h withdrawal timepoints. Psilocin increased corticosterone at 24&nbsp;h withdrawal but not at 72&nbsp;h withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that psilocin engages CeA circuitry and decreases relative CRF1 activation, in parallel with acute reductions in drinking. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the actions of psilocin and inform the interpretation of therapeutic effects in clinical studies.</p>",

      "title": "Neural Tracking of the Maternal Voice in the Infant Brain",
      "content": "<p>Infants preferentially process familiar social signals, but the neural mechanisms underlying continuous processing of maternal speech remain unclear. Using EEG-based neural encoding models based on temporal response functions, we investigated how 7-month-old human infants track maternal versus unfamiliar speech and whether this affects simultaneous face processing. Infants (13 boys, 12 girls) showed stronger neural tracking of their mother's voice, independent of acoustic properties, suggesting an early neural signature of voice familiarity. Furthermore, central encoding of unfamiliar faces was diminished when infants heard their mother's voice and face tracking accuracy at central electrodes increased with earlier occipital face tracking, suggesting heightened attentional engagement. However, we found no evidence for differential processing of happy versus fearful faces, contrasting previous findings on early emotion discrimination. Our results reveal interactive effects of voice familiarity on multimodal processing in infancy: while maternal speech enhances neural tracking, it may also alter how other social cues, such as faces, are processed. The findings suggest that early auditory experiences shape how infants allocate cognitive resources to social stimuli, emphasizing the need to consider cross-modal influences in early development.</p>",
