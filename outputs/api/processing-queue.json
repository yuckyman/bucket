      "title": "Structural Brain Indicators of Cognitive Performance in Middle and Late Adulthood: The Human Connectome Project in Aging/Aging Adult Brain Connectome Cohort",
      "content": "Introduction: Significant effort has been put towards mapping patterns of atrophy in the cerebral cortex that are related to pathological aging, including the characteristic patterns of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, brain structural patterns that support preserved or even exceptional cognition throughout the adult age-span and especially in later life are much less known. It is possible that superior cognitive performance in late life is supported by a preservation of brain structures vulnerable to typical aging. Alternatively, elevated performance could be related to preservation of brain regions vulnerable to age-associated pathology. Examination of individuals that exhibit superior cognition throughout the adult lifespan may provide unique insights into neural mechanisms that support cognitive resilience in late life. Methods: We examined cross-sectional associations between cortical brain structure and cognitive performance across three stages of adulthood: midlife (36-59), young-old (60-79), and older adults (80+) in typically aging individuals enrolled as part of the Human Connectome Project Lifespan-Aging (HCP-A)/Aging Adult Brain Connectome (AABC) studies. Participants were considered generally healthy and excluded for significant and/or atypical health conditions for their demographic category, including a clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia. Domain-specific cognitive factor scores representing memory, fluid intelligence, and crystalized intelligence were sex-stratified and residualized relative to age, and participants were classified as high, middle, or low performers based on their unique performance relative to the study sample. Results: In the full sample, high performers demonstrated greater cortical thickness in regions of somatomotor, visual, and auditory cortices, as well as cortical areas in the frontal, parietal, and insular cortices (e.g., 5m, LIPv, MBelt). We also found associations between medial temporal and cingulate cortical thickness and cognitive performance, but only for select analyses. Group differences in cortical thickness were greatest when contrasting high and low performers for fluid intelligence compared to the other cognitive factors and were most prominent in the midlife participants compared to the other age strata. These group differences were primarily driven by reduced cortical thickness in the low performing individuals in the younger age bins relative to the 'typically' performing sample. Effects were rather limited when contrasting high and low performers in the 80+ age group. The cortical areas of high statistical significance appeared to show a cross-sectional convergence effect, such that the differences in cortical thickness between high vs. low cognitive performance groups diminished with increasing age. Despite lower statistical power, effect sizes were greatest when contrasting individuals at the extremes of performance (e.g., top 10% vs. bottom 10% performers). These effects were robust to subsample replications using longitudinally defined cognitive classifications. Discussion: Elevated cognitive performance was cross-sectionally associated with increased regional cortical thickness and effects were most prominent in mid-life compared to later ages. Notably, contrary to brain regions that may be expected to support such high-order cognitive performance, a significant portion of primary sensory, motor, and insular cortical areas exhibited group differences between the high- and low-performing groups in this relatively younger age group. Group differences were due to lower thickness in these regions in the low performing group relative to the typical performers. In contrast to the younger portion of the sample, regions typically considered vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (i.e., regions in the medial temporal lobe) were only infrequently implicated. These results suggest that specific patterns of cortical brain structural integrity including preserved thickness of primary motor and sensory cortical regions may be a necessary but not sufficient mechanism supporting superior cognitive abilities in earlier adulthood, while alternate neural mechanisms may support cognitive resilience later in life. These results must be interpreted with caution given the cross-sectional nature of this study. Cognitive capacity can only be estimated from a single timepoint, and several factors contribute to inter-individual variation that will not be accounted for in the models applied here. Longitudinal assessment of cognitive resilience in the HCP-A/AABC cohort will be performed in future work.",

      "title": "Clonazepam activates the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channel",
      "content": "Benzodiazepines represent a major class of drugs prescribed as treatments for anxiety, insomnia and seizures. They act by engaging GABAA receptors in the central nervous system to depress neuronal excitability. Here, the polypharmacology of benzodiazepines was explored by studying their engagement of human TRP channels revealing clonazepam acts as a robust and selective activator of the TRPM8 ion channel. Clonazepam-evoked Ca2+ signals were observed in cells expressing human TRPM8 channels, and in mouse trigeminal neurons. These responses were completely blocked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TRPM8 function. This discovery likely explains why clonazepam is an effective treatment for the painful oral condition known as burning mouth disorder, where local activation of TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons mitigates the painful symptoms of this disease.",

      "title": "A HISTORY OF ADOLESCENT OXYCODONE SELF-ADMINISTRATION: NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS",
      "content": "Maturation of the prefrontal cortex and higher-order cognitive processes is ongoing through adolescence and young adulthood; developmental periods associated with the nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Initiation of oxycodone (OXY) self-administration during adolescence induces long-term dose-dependent impairments in neurobehavioral and neurocognitive development. To date, however, the neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitive impairments induced by adolescent prescription opioid use disorder (APOUD) have not been systematically evaluated. A DiOlistic labeling technique, in concert with sophisticated neuronal reconstruction software, revealed a prominent sex- and dose-dependent population shift in the morphological parameters of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of rodents with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to their control counterparts. Similarly, the biochemical mechanisms underlying dendritic spine dysmorphology, which were investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were dependent upon biological sex. In male rodents, a dose-dependent decrease in mRNA expression of GRIN1, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, was observed in animals with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to controls. In contrast, female rats with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration exhibited increased mRNA expression of cdk5, a protein kinase involved in the regulation of pre- and post-synaptic function; a transcriptional alteration that may result from excessive glutamate accumulation. Fundamentally, transcriptional dysregulation and dendritic spine dysmorphology mechanistically underlie, at least partly, APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Collectively, results support that sex-dependent glutamatergic dysregulation may underlie dendritic spine dysmorphology in the ACC resulting in APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Glutamatergic dysregulation, therefore, may afford a key target for the development of novel therapeutics.",

      "title": "Signal space beamforming for gain- and geometry-independent interference suppression in wearable MEG",
      "content": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) for wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer substantial flexibility compared to cryogenic MEG, but they also introduce new challenges related to environmental noise and movement artefacts. State-of-the-art denoising techniques such as signal space separation require not only dense OPM arrays but also the fine calibration of sensor gain and geometry. This may complicate their use in complex experimental situations involving uncooperative patients or subjects such as newborns or fetuses, where OPM positioning may be unstable or plain unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce signal space beamforming (SSB), a version of beamforming applied to sensor signals and designed to suppress interferences independently of sensor gain and geometry. We show that SSB operates via a trade-off between noise suppression and neural signal preservation that is controlled by a single soft-threshold parameter, which we calibrated using phantom measurements. We then validated the effectiveness of SSB across several datasets. Using interictal OPM-MEG recordings in epileptic patients, SSB successfully cleaned signals while preserving epileptiform discharges. Moving onto cutting-edge early neurodevelopmental OPM-MEG recordings, SSB allowed to recover auditory evoked responses in newborns and fetuses similar to previous findings but with more streamlined preprocessing and higher response amplitude in the case of the fetal data. We contend that SSB provides a pragmatic solution to exploit OPM-MEG data recorded in challenging conditions where geometry-dependent methods cannot be used, opening new frontiers for pioneering clinical and fundamental applications of the OPM technology.",

      "title": "Rendering Affective Touch With an Array of Pneumatic Unit Cell Actuators",
      "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

Phosphorylated tau aggregation, as well as seeding activity, were observed without the need for exogenous seeds. Our cryo-EM analysis resolved a novel filament fold incorporating residues 279-329, in which the P301L and S320F mutations introduced stabilizing interactions that reinforced filament assembly. This conformation was distinct from previously reported folds, including Alzheimer and Pick tau filaments. Moreover, the filaments adopted a more compact architecture than those observed in patient-derived samples or other model mice. This finding demonstrates that P301L/S320F double-mutant tau adopts a structurally unique, highly aggregation-prone fold, and that this system provides a rapid platform for modeling tau filament formation.",

      "title": "Time-frequency embedding with contrastive pre-training allows sub-second seizure detection",
      "content": "Rapid and accurate detection of electrographic seizures is critical for both clinical diagnosis and neuroscience research. Although seizure identification is commonly performed in the time domain, analysis in the time-frequency domain provides a more comprehensive representation of seizure characteristics. In this study, we present a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporates a trainable continuous wavelet transform (CWT) layer, enabling adaptive time-frequency feature learning directly from raw EEG. To address common data challenges, we augment the 3D CNN for pre-training with contrastive learning, comparing contrastive predictive coding (CPC) against bidirectional contrastive learning (BiCL). On single-channel and multi-channel data, the standard 3D CNN outperformed both a 2D CNN with pre-computed CWT and a 1D CNN that processes raw signals, achieving >95% accuracy down to 0.5-second segments. Compared to the standard 3D CNN, the 3D CNN with BiCL pre-training showed superior performance in both low-data and class imbalance scenarios. Further experiments involving band-pass filtering and temporal shuffling revealed that classification is driven primarily by low-frequency patterns and statistical features rather than temporal dependencies. The proposed framework also maintained >90% accuracy with moderate noise and downsampling applied to inputs, as well as when cross-subject generalization was evaluated using held-out subjects. We show that a 3D CNN with a trainable CWT layer and BiCL pre-training enables accurate sub-second seizure detection and effectively mitigates data limitations common in clinical settings. This work demonstrates that time-frequency embedding within CNNs, augmented by self-supervised pre-training, offers a promising path toward architectures for sub-second seizure detection in the presence of practical limitations of real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Reduced GABAB receptor activation and post activation depression of proprioceptive afferents after spinal cord injury.",
      "content": "Despite a long history of studying presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferent synapse that produces the monosynaptic EPSP on motoneurons, recent evidence has upset the conventional idea that GABAA receptors mediate this inhibition and instead suggests that there are mainly GABAB receptors at this synapse. However, without targeted access to the GABAergic neurons that activate these receptors, quantifying their functional contribution to presynaptic inhibition has proven difficult. We demonstrate here that focal optogenetic activation of terminals of a subpopulation of GAD2+ GABAergic neurons that exclusively project ventrally to Ia afferent synapses produce long-lasting presynaptic inhibition that is entirely mediated by GABAB receptors and simultaneously produces a characteristic brief GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP on the motoneurons. These ventral GAD2 neurons are recurrently activated by Ia afferents, contributing to post-activation depression with repeated afferent reflex testing, with a similar long time-course to post-activation depression of the H-reflex induced in humans from either repetitive activation of the same Ia afferents or from antagonist nerve conditioning. In contrast, focal activation of dorsally projecting GAD2 neurons does not directly cause presynaptic inhibition or postsynaptic IPSPs but does produce primary afferent depolarization. Following chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), the expression of GABAB receptors on the Ia terminal is halved, and in mice and humans, is associated with a similar decrease of GABAB receptor-mediated post-activation depression of Ia-EPSPs transmission, which is reversed by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. In summary, GABAB receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition, but are down regulated with SCI, contributing to reflex hyperexcitability associated with spasticity.",

      "content": "Focused-attention meditation provides a tractable model for examining how large-scale brain dynamics support attention and self-regulation. Using high-density EEG microstate analysis, we investigated how focused-attention meditation on the breath (Anapanasati) modulates intrinsic brain activity in 22 experienced practitioners, compared with baseline rest and deliberate mental imagery. Five canonical microstate classes (A-E) were identified. Meditation produced a robust reduction of Microstate C across coverage, duration, and occurrence, accompanied by increased presence of Microstates D and E (all Microstate x Condition interactions p < 0.0001). Source localization revealed that Microstate C was generated primarily in medial and lateral temporal regions including the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, whereas Microstate D involved posterior midline regions including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and Microstate E engaged frontoparietal and orbitolimbic networks. Together, these results indicate that focused-attention meditation reorganizes the temporal architecture of large-scale brain dynamics by downregulating microstate patterns associated with self-referential and memory-based processing while enhancing neural states supporting attentional stability and internal monitoring.",

In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

      "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

      "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
      "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

      "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
      "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

      "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",
