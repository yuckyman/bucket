      "title": "Associative emotional memory encoding: Insights from network stability analysis of an fMRI-driven bilinear dynamics",
      "content": "The interplay between emotion and memory is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience, with open questions about the underlying neuronal mechanisms. This article studies dynamic interactions among the hippocampus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex during an fMRI associative memory encoding task. Participants were clustered into three condition groups: Neutral Neutral, Neutral Emotional, or Emotional Emotional, and viewed image pairs associated with their assigned condition. Using the dynamic causal modeling framework, we explore several dynamic models and show that a stochastic bilinear state space model best describes the neuronal dynamics in all conditions. Furthermore, we use graph and control theory techniques to both validate and analyze the model. In particular, we analyze the network dynamics of each condition using tools from graph theory and stability theory and discuss the differences in the strength and direction of connectivity as well as the stability of each of these networks. We confirm the prior finding that memory is enhanced in emotional conditions, in particular in the Neutral Emotional condition. In our work, this enhanced memory is associated with increased hippocampus amygdala coupling and overall network connectivity. In addition, we show that in the Emotional Emotional condition, the coupling of the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the whole network connectivity increases when the first image valence is substantially less negative rated than the second image. This pattern mirrors the Neutral Emotional condition, where the first image is neutral compared with the second one. Moreover, our model based analyses suggest that the amygdala predominantly influences the other two regions in the Neutral Emotional condition, whereas the OFC plays a dominant role in the other two conditions. Combined data driven modeling, stability analyses, and graph theory tools led to new insights and enhanced the mechanistic understanding of cortical dynamics of emotional associative memory. We discuss these insights, utilize these analytical tools to generalize our findings to some unmeasured conditions, and highlight the potential of these techniques to inform the design of future regulatory mechanisms.",

      "title": "Injury-transduced SerpinOLs modulate neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS",
      "content": "Oligodendroglial dysfunction is common in CNS diseases, but the molecular and functional responses of oligodendroglia to CNS pathologies remain poorly defined. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes (OLs) respond to demyelinating diseases by dysregulating serine protease inhibitor clade A member 3N (SERPINA3N). Homeostatic OLs transition to Serpina3n-expressing OLs (SerpinOLs) under other diseased conditions including stroke, endotoxicity, neurodegeneration, neurotrauma, and non-diseased healthy aging conditions. Mechanistically, CNS inflammation or inflammatory mediators is sufficient for SerpinOL transition. Instead, oligodendrocyte injury even in the absence of neuroinflammation or glial activation is sufficient for the transition. Phenotypically, SerpinOLs are characterized by molecular signatures of inflammatory and immune regulation and STAT3 signaling activation. Functionally, SerpinOLs exacerbate neuroinflammation and promote glial activation toward pro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative states. Together, our findings suggest SerpinOLs are a common population of injury-transduced OLs that amplify neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS through SERPINA3N secretion. Our findings provide new insights into myelination-independent role of OLs in regulating CNS pathophysiology.",

      "title": "Linear and Nonlinear Oscillatory Functional Brain Networks in Euthymic Bipolar Disorder Classification",
      "content": "Functional brain network (FBN) dysconnectivity has been repeatedly reported in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unclear how this dysconnectivity manifests from the perspective of oscillatory FBNs, that is, which network measures and frequency bands most reliably capture this alteration. Moreover, it is unknown whether this dysconnection is predominantly expressed through linear or nonlinear interactions. Here, we investigated properties of oscillatory FBNs in individuals with euthymic BD. Networks were constructed using linear and nonlinear connectivity measures applied to source-localized resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) current density signals. We then quantified whole-FBN and nodal features using conventional and spectral graph theory methods to characterize disorder-related network mechanisms and evaluate their potential as biomarkers. Significant group differences between BD and control groups were observed in the theta and alpha1 bands. Dynamical whole-FBN alterations were detected primarily in linear oscillatory FBNs, with reduced Shannon entropy and energy in the BD group. These effects were replicated using machine learning, achieving 85% classification accuracy with entropy and energy as the most informative features. In contrast, nodal-level differences emerged mainly in nonlinear FBNs, revealing increased centrality in frontal, and decreased centrality across temporal, and limbic regions. These findings emphasize distinct, frequency-specific roles of linear and nonlinear oscillatory FBNs in BD, with global dysconnectivity reflected in linear FBNs and local alterations captured by nonlinear connectivity. Moreover, network measures related to synchronization stability and complexity more effectively capture BD-related dysconnectivity, suggesting that dynamic features of oscillatory FBNs may serve as potential biomarkers for BD.",

      "title": "Hippocampal Projections to the Striatal Compartments, Striosome and Matrix, are Spatially Segregated in CA1",
      "content": "The hippocampus routes information to the striatum through at least four polysynaptic circuits. Striatal projection neurons are organized into two tissue compartments, the matrix and striosome, which differ in their embryologic origins, relative abundance, intra-striate location, and afferent and efferent connectivity. These compartments are embedded in distinct functional networks and are activated by different tasks. Consequently, hippocampal inputs that route preferentially through the striosome may underpin different functions and engage with different remote networks than inputs that route through the matrix. It was unknown whether striosome-bound and matrix-bound projections from the hippocampus followed different polysynaptic circuits. We assessed hippocampo-striate projections in living humans using probabilistic diffusion tractography by first parcellating the striatum into voxels with striosome-like and matrix-like structural connectivity. We then quantified structural connectivity between hippocampal efferents (CA1) to each set of compartment-like voxels. CA1 projections to striosome-like voxels in the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) were 3.1-fold more abundant than those to matrix-like voxels, particularly in caudo-lateral CA1. This striosome-favoring bias was similar in three segregated hippocampo-striate circuits, in streamlines routing through the subiculum, lateral septum, or medial prefrontal cortex. However, a small region in rostro-medial CA1 preferentially targeted matrix-like voxels. Functional connectivity between CA1 and compartment-like voxels matched this segregated pattern: CA1 activation was correlated with striosome-like voxels but anti-correlated with matrix-like voxels. Additionally, streamlines from CA1 to nucleus accumbens exhibited hemispheric asymmetries, with the left hemisphere biased towards matrix and the right towards striosome. These findings suggest that hippocampo-striate projections are spatially segregated into compartment-specific circuits.",

      "content": "Sensory neuron soma and non-neuronal cells in adult dorsal root ganglia (DRG) derive from multipotent neural crest cells. Satellite glial cells (SGCs), which surround neuronal soma, were suggested to retain developmental potential, but the precise molecular identity of progenitor cells in the adult DRG remains undefined. To address this question, we assembled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas by integrating over 200,000 DRG and sciatic nerve transcriptomes across multiple studies and injury paradigms. High-resolution clustering resolved 26 cell types and demonstrated significant transcriptional heterogeneity within SGCs and Schwann cells, including repair and reactive sub-states. Crucially, we identified two distinct populations of progenitor cells that reflect different states in the progenitor trajectory. Functionally, progenitor cell numbers significantly increase after injury, and endothelin signaling regulates glial cell proliferation early in development. This integrated DRG and peripheral nerve cell atlas represents an essential resource for exploring new features of the peripheral nervous system.",

      "content": "In mammals, neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO) encode information about sounds arising from discrete spatial locations along the horizon. This tuning requires that an internal delay in the brain must offset acoustic disparities to ensure coincident arrival of excitatory inputs driven from the two ears. The source of this internal delay, originally assumed to arise from axonal delay lines, is currently controversial in mammals. Here we use 2-photon guided paired dendritic and somatic recordings together with compartmental modeling of 40 complete MSO neuron morphologies to demonstrate that the dendrites themselves serve as a significant source of internal delay. We show that most MSO neurons exhibit morphological asymmetries that impose different EPSP delays across dendrites and shifts in optimal interaural time differences. Dendrite-based delays in the mammalian MSO are heterogeneous within each isofrequency laminae and provide a stable, structural mechanism to help tune individual neurons to sounds from different azimuthal locations.",

      "title": "mPFC Synaptosome Proteomics Reveals Novel Pathways and Muscarinic Receptor Changes in a Learned Helplessness Mouse Model",
      "content": "Stressful events are a leading factor in development of depression. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is strongly associated with depression etiology and exposure to uncontrollable stressors results in synaptic dysfunction and loss. Learned helplessness is a behavioral paradigm that measures effects of repeated exposure to uncontrollable, inescapable stress on later responses to escapable stress. We therefore performed a proteomic analysis of mPFC synaptosomes in a mouse learned helplessness model to identify molecular changes that could contribute to functional consequences of inescapable stress. Male and female mice were evaluated at baseline and following exposure to escapable or inescapable stress followed by an active avoidance test. Label-free mass spectrometry followed by pathway and protein-protein interaction network analyses identified alterations in signaling pathways involved in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and protein shuttling. Furthermore, phosphoproteomics revealed alterations related to synaptic function, neurotransmitter signaling and protein internalization, as well as changes in activity of kinases previously identified as mediators of antidepressant efficacy (GSK3B) and receptor internalization (ADRBK1). We more deeply examined alterations in the Acetylcholine Receptor Signaling Pathway, and identified muscarinic receptor proteins (Chrm1, Chrm2, Chrm4) and key proteins involved in their translocation to and from the membrane. These results identify substantial changes in the mPFC proteome following exposure to inescapable stressors. In addition, mPFC muscarinic cholinergic signaling is well placed to mediate responses to an inescapable stressor. This proteomic study will be useful in guiding studies of human mPFC relevant to depression. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD073765.",

      "title": "Intrinsic Circadian Organization of the Spinal Cord and Dorsal Root Ganglia",
      "content": "Circadian rhythms coordinate daily fluctuations in physiology and behavior, yet their organization within primary sensory pathways remains poorly defined. Although somatosensory responsiveness varies across the day night cycle, it is unclear whether peripheral sensory circuits possess molecular mechanisms for temporal regulation. Here, we demonstrate that the spinal peripheral sensory axis harbors robust, tissue autonomous circadian clocks. Using real time bioluminescence imaging, we observed sustained oscillations of the core clock protein PER2 in the spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), indicating autonomous circadian timing within these tissues. To define the molecular scope of this regulation, we performed RNA sequencing across a 52 hours circadian time course in DRGs. Circadian analysis identified 626 rhythmic transcripts, representing 3.6% of expressed genes. These genes exhibited non uniform phase distributions and segregated into discrete temporal clusters. Functional annotation revealed phase specific enrichment of biological processes related to transport, neuronal structure, and proteostasis, suggesting coordinated temporal deployment of distinct molecular programs rather than uniform oscillations across the circadian cycle. Cross referencing circadian genes with neuropathic pain associated gene sets revealed limited overlap; however, overlapping genes aligned to specific baseline phase windows enriched for regenerative annotations. Potassium channel related signaling components implicated in neuropathic pain also showed baseline circadian modulation. Together, these findings establish the spinal dorsal horn and DRGs as intrinsically circadian tissues and reveal a temporally structured molecular landscape in primary sensory neurons, providing a framework for understanding how peripheral sensory processing, plasticity, and homeostatic regulation are coordinated across the day night cycle.",
