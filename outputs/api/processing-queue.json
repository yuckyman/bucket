      "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

      "title": "Body and brain signalling during naturalistic learning situations",
      "content": "A central challenge in supporting learning and designing learning environments is to understand individual differences in learning experiences. However, despite growing interest in examining learning experiences in naturalistic contexts, studies employing multimethod and hyperscanning approaches remain scarce. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) were combined to measure brain activity, heart rate, and heart rate variability simultaneously during authentic learning situations in aviation and forestry. We investigated how students and instructors cardiac and brain activity varied across different phases of a naturalistic learning situation and tasks with varying levels of difficulty. Results indicate that both students and instructors heart rate, heart rate variability, and brain activity vary systematically across behaviourally and pedagogically meaningful phases of the learning situation. These findings enhance our understanding of how physiological and neural activity vary within and across individuals during learning, providing insight into the nervous system determinants underlying individual differences in learning experiences.",

      "title": "Multimodal Imaging-Based Targeting Approach for Network-Level Brain Stimulation",
      "content": "Background: Neural network effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are poorly understood. Here, we introduce an empirically informed, multimodal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based framework suited for guiding stimulation target selection and hypothesis-based data analysis in focal tDCS-fMRI studies. Methods: We illustrate our approach using data of 37 healthy individuals (19 females; mean +/- SD age = 25.8 +/- 5.9) recruited from a multicenter tDCS-fMRI study (www.memoslap.de/en/home/). Participants completed resting-state (RS- and task-fMRI (object-location memory, OLM, or associative picture-pseudoword learning, APPL, experiments) with placebo tDCS. Seed-based RS data analysis identified the functional networks originating from project-specific target regions for focal tDCS (right occipito-temporal cortex, rOTC; left ventral IFG, lvIFG) and also established their test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Dice coefficients analyzed the overlap between the seeded RS- and task-evoked networks. This aimed to identify task-active regions potentially affected by downstream neural network effects from the target regions. Results: Seed-based analyses identified two highly reliable ventral visual-limbic (rOTC) and language-related networks (lvIFG), with >72-77% of voxels showing good-to-excellent TRR (ICC >/=; 0.75). Only a subset of voxels identified by the RS analyses overlapped with activity elicited by the experimental paradigms (ranging from 7-55%), with larger correspondence for the OLM task (Dice OLM: 0.249-0.349; APPL 0.112-0.121). Therefore, the degree of potential tDCS network effects varied substantially depending on the target region, the extent of its functional network and task-specific activity patterns. Degree of correspondence was further mediated by the selected contrasts-of-interest in the task-based analyses, with more conservative control conditions resulting in reduced overlap. Conclusion: We established a principled, multimodal fMRI framework bridging a critical gap in neuromodulation research. By integrating reliable intrinsic connectivity maps with task-evoked activity patterns, we provide a method to prospectively identify network-level targets for focal brain stimulation and to generate hypotheses for data analyses in tDCS-fMRI studies. This approach paves the way for investigating modulation of specific functional networks, shifting the rationale from stimulating an isolated brain region to strategically targeting key nodes within a predefined functional pathway.",

      "content": "Early-life adversity has a lasting negative impact on social behavior in both humans and rodents. Sex differences exist in functional outcomes of postnatal stress, but underlying mechanisms remain incompletely explored. Using the limited bedding and nesting paradigm, a mouse model of developmental scarcity, we found sex differences in social behavior with adult males showing impaired social recognition and adult females showing intact social recognition with enhanced social novelty preference. Perineuronal nets, specialized extracellular matrix structures, are known to inhibit developmental plasticity and are concentrated in the CA2 region of the hippocampus in adulthood. We found higher intensity of CA2 perineuronal nets in adult males, but not adult females, after early life adversity. Focal degradation of the extracellular matrix in the CA2 region restored social recognition function in adult males previously subjected to early stress, suggesting that the effects of developmental adversity may be overcome by targeted intervention in adulthood.",

      "title": "Repeatable, low-drift recordings in behaving non-human primates using flexible microelectrodes",
      "content": "Neurophysiological recordings from non-human primates (NHPs) have traditionally relied on rigid microelectrode arrays made from stainless steel or silicon. While these devices enable high-quality recordings, a fundamental mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft brain tissue leads to inflammation, gliosis, and signal instability. In particular, brain micromotion causes continuous drifting of neurons relative to fixed electrodes, compromising single-unit tracking during both chronic and acute recordings. Flexible, penetrating electrodes offer a promising solution, but their adoption in NHPs has been hindered by the technical challenges of delivering ultra-thin polymers through thick dura mater. Here, we demonstrate a comprehensive approach for acute, repeated recordings in awake, behaving NHPs using flexible arrays. We fabricated a microelectrode array that spans cortical layers with 32 cellular-scale recording sites embedded in 7 m-thick parylene-C. We developed a novel \"telescopic\" insertion method that combines concentric guide tubes with a retractable microwire shuttle. Our technique is compatible with standard chronic recording chambers and allowed for repeated penetration of free-floating arrays through intact dura over weeks without the need for a new craniotomy. Across two awake rhesus macaques, we optimized the electrode geometry and insertion procedure to achieve an 80% single-unit recording success rate. As animals performed an oculomotor delayed response task, we recorded task-responsive neurons from prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex with stable single-unit activity throughout 1-2-hour behavioral sessions. Critically, by comparing our flexible arrays to rigid probes in the same animals and recording chambers, we provide quantitative evidence that flexible electrodes reduce total single-unit drift from hundreds to tens of microns.

      "title": "Autocrine feedback maintains homeostatic neuropeptide expression in a peptidergichub neuron",
      "content": "Neuronal circuits sustain stable function by self-regulating their gene expression and neurosecretion. Patterns for autocrine feedback by neuropeptides are widespread across nervous systems, but how they contribute to neuronal homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an autocrine homeostatic mechanism in a C. elegans peptidergic hub neuron. FLP-1 neuropeptide release activates the inhibitory receptor DMSR-7 on the AVK hub neurons to self-regulate flp-1 transcription, dense-core vesicle accumulation, and peptide secretion. We show that a parallel PDF-1/PDFR-1 pathway drives flp-1 expression, establishing a \"push-and-pull\" peptidergic feedback on the AVK neurons. AVK's peptidergic output also depends on the number of FLP-1 peptides encoded in its precursor, revealing a dosage mechanism in behavioral regulation. Moreover, flp-1 expression coordinates transcript levels of additional neuropeptides in AVK. These findings uncover FLP-1 as a self-regulating homeostatic controller within a peptidergic hub neuron and illustrate how precursor-encoded redundancy supports stable yet adaptable circuit states.",

      "title": "3D Light Sheet Microscopy Reveals Aging Osteoarthritis-associated Joint-innervated Nerve Remodeling in Mouse Knee Joints",
      "content": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent age related joint disease-causing chronic pain. This study investigated how nociceptive and sympathetic nerve innervation in the mouse knee joint changes with age and OA progression, and how these changes relate to pain and disease severity. Methods: Thirty-eight mice were assigned to four groups: young male (My), aged male (Ma), young female (Fy), and aged female (Fa). Pain sensitivity was evaluated via Pressure Application Measurement (PAM), and joint damage was graded using OARSI scoring. CGRP and PIEZO2 expressions in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were also assessed. We employed iDISCO tissue clearing and 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize total (PGP9.5), nociceptive (CGRP), and sympathetic (TH) nerve fibers in anterior regions of mouse knee joints. A MATLAB-based tool quantified nerve architecture. Results: The Ma group displayed the highest OA severity and markedly lower mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared with My, suggesting an age effect on pain-related behavior. This phenotype was accompanied by a higher total PGP9.5; nerve fiber density in the knee joint and increased CGRP nociceptive innervation. In contrast, female mice showed no age-dependent change in PAM withdrawal thresholds, consistent with preserved cartilage integrity and stable OARSI scores, and no detectable age-related differences in PGP9.5; or CGRP; innervation. The TH; sympathetic fiber distribution was comparable across sexes and ages. Consistent with joint-level findings, DRG analyses demonstrated increased CGRP and PIEZO2 expression in the Ma group, whereas females exhibited no significant change. Conclusion: Enhanced nociceptive but not sympathetic nerve remodeling in knee cavities is associated with increased OA severity and knee pain in the Ma group. These findings emphasize the role of peripheral sensory plasticity in OA pain and demonstrate the value of 3D imaging for visualizing neuroanatomical changes in joint disorders.",

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.
