      "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "Closed-loop coupling of both physiological spindle model and spinal pathways for sensorimotor control of human center-out reaching",
      "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

      "title": "Autonomous retrieval for continuous learning in associative memory networks",
      "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

      "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
      "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

      "title": "Spacetime concordance in the primate cortex",
      "content": "The expanding scale and complexity of functional brain image datasets require space-time analytics. Spacetime concordance (STC) meets this need through an adaptive and robust framework optimized for high-speed analysis. At the core of STC, the Regional Functional Affinity (RFA) metric quantifies functional diversity and uniformity in primate connectomes using wakeful fMRI. This data-driven optimization achieves considerably faster processing, becoming broadly relevant to comparative neuroscience applications. We validated this approach using large-scale datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 1,003) and the NIH Marmoset Brain Mapping Project (N = 26). Results demonstrate striking correspondence between parcellation boundaries of HCP atlas and functional heterogeneity, with boundary lines consistently aligning with regions of low RFA values. In humans, higher-order association networks exhibited lower RFA values indicating functional diversity, while primary sensorimotor networks displayed higher RFA values reflecting uniformity. Cross-species analysis revealed evolutionary conservation of this organizational principle alongside species-specific adaptations. The RFA metric successfully bridges discrete parcellation schemes and continuous models of brain function, offering new insights into primate brain organization and evolution.",

      "title": "Beyond the straight path: high-density laminar recordings in the ventral hippocampus with curved microprobes",
      "content": "Brain function is governed by neural circuits distributed across an intricate, three-dimensional landscape of anatomically complex structures. Current methods for monitoring neural activity are limited to investigating structures that lie along a single, linear trajectory. While this approach is effective for columnar regions, such as dorsal cortical areas or the relatively planar dorsal hippocampus, it fails in deep or curved structures, like the ventral hippocampus, where a linear probe can only achieve with difficulty the combination of physical access and perpendicular orientation required for recordings across all layers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a multisite microelectrode array with a pre-formed curved geometry, engineered to align perpendicularly with neuronal layers in deep anatomical targets regardless of their orientation. This interface integrates a polymer-based array, featuring 16 PEDOT:BF4-coated microelectrodes for robust signal acquisition, with a dissolvable silk stiffener for precise surgical insertion. The resulting device exhibited excellent electrical properties (avg. impedance 18 k{Omega}) and enabled accurate placement across the distinct neuronal layers of the ventral hippocampus CA1 region. These capabilities allowed for successful recordings of both local field potentials and single-unit activity from this region, providing a powerful new tool to investigate the network dynamics of previously inaccessible neural circuits.",

      "title": "Flexible gaze reinstatement during working memory for natural scenes",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) representations may be more action-oriented and anatomically widespread than previously assumed. For instance, oculomotor signatures like gaze biases can reflect spatial WM content. However, the specificity and functional relevance of such signatures is unclear. Here, we tracked eye gaze during WM for naturalistic images, and manipulated which image features were most task-relevant (visual or semantic). In two experiments, we found that the eyes carried out item-specific spatiotemporal gaze sequences during WM maintenance, retracing the scanpath from stimulus encoding. Therefore, gaze patterns during WM track the identity of complex, natural images held in mind. Moreover, the degree of such WM gaze reinstatement was stronger when the task prioritized visual detail, and ramped up in anticipation of the test probe. Oculomotor WM signals are therefore malleable to when and how the content will be used, indicating that distributed WM representations are prospectively-oriented and functionally flexible to situational needs.",
