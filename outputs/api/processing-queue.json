      "content": "Inappropriate externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) is a candidate mechanism of pathogenic neuroinflammation, a critical driver of neurodegenerative disease. ATP8A2, a flippase that maintains PS on the plasma membrane inner leaflet, is mutated in both Wabbler- lethal mice and patients with the ataxia syndrome CAMRQ4. Here, we identify ATP8A2 as a target of TDP-43 cryptic exon suppression, and demonstrate that ATP8A2 loss leads to immune-mediated neurodegeneration. ATP8A2 splicing is significantly dysregulated following TDP-43 depletion in human neurons and in brains of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS-FTD). In mice, Atp8a2 loss increases PS exposure and promotes neuroinflammation. Depletion of peripheral macrophages rescues motor axon degeneration and doubles Atp8a2 knockout mouse lifespan, while depletion of both peripheral macrophages and central microglia quadruples lifespan and improves coordination. Hence, ATP8A2 is a pathologically relevant TDP-43 target and inhibition of phagocytic immune cell attack against neurons is a potential treatment for patients with CAMRQ4 and ALS-FTD.",

      "title": "Negative-Valence Neurons in the Larval Zebrafish Pallium",
      "content": "An organism's survival depends on the rapid classification of sensory events as either harmful or beneficial. In mammals, this computation is partially performed by neurons in the amygdala that respond to signals with negative or positive valence. The larval zebrafish pallium is thought to contain homologs of the mammalian amygdala, isocortex, and hippocampus; however, the signals encoded by pallial neurons remain largely uncharacterized. Using two-photon light sheet microscopy to image 7-9 day old zebrafish that express pan-neuronal GCaMP6s, we recorded calcium dynamics throughout the brain while presenting a panel of strongly aversive stimuli, infrared heat, electric shock, and a whole-field looming shadow, together with milder threats including vibration, loud sound, light transitions, and a partial looming stimulus. A compact cluster of neurons in the rostrolateral dorsal pallium (Rl) responded vigorously to strongly noxious and fully looming stimuli, but not to the milder cues. In contrast, neurons in the ventromedial pallium and habenula responded to all stimuli tested. Rl neurons are marked by high expression of tiam2a, suggesting that they could be accessed genetically. Our results identify a dedicated negative valence locus in the teleost pallium and underscore evolutionary conservation of valence coding circuits.",

      "title": "Visual perceptual learning enhances functional connectivity in retinotopic space",
      "content": "Repeated exposure to perceptual tasks improves behavioral performance. Several neural mechanisms have been proposed to account for such perceptual learning. Computational modeling suggests that plasticity in the connectivity between cortical sites may be responsible, by increasing the fidelity with which task-relevant information is transmitted through sensory hierarchies. Here we explore this theory in humans using fMRI, testing the hypothesis that perceptual learning at one location in space will increase functional connectivity between voxels in visual areas that are tuned to that retinotopic location. Participants learned to detect one of two novel visual shape contours embedded in a noisy background in different visual quadrants. At baseline, there was no difference in behavioral sensitivity for the two shapes, nor a difference in functional connectivity between voxels in V1 and V4 responsive to the retinotopic locations of the two shapes. After training, there was a robust and selective improvement in perceptual detection of the trained shape relative to the control shape, along with increased functional connectivity between V1 and V4 voxels coding for the location of the trained shape in retinotopic space. Moreover, this increase in functional connectivity for the trained versus control shape predicted the improvement in behavioral sensitivity across participants. These results are consistent with the proposal that perceptual learning alters network dynamics so as to enhance the processing of behaviorally relevant information.",

      "content": "Plasma pTau217, an emerging Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker, may reflect a synaptic response to {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques before cortical tangle formation, but the broader biological processes at play remain unclear. Using whole blood RNAseq, we sought to identify gene expression associated with plasma pTau217 and to determine whether APOE{epsilon}4, sex, and neocortical A{beta}-PET burden further amplify these associations in 724 participants from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) Studies. 1,540 genes were moderated by A{beta}-PET, and 772 genes were moderated by both A{beta}-PET and sex. Our findings include genes previously associated with AD (e.g., TREML2) and implicate biological functions such as chromatin remodeling, lipid signaling, and RNA processing that interact with A{beta}-PET and sex to impact plasma pTau217. Our results underscore the complexity of molecular mechanisms that can be linked to plasma pTau217, particularly in the context of elevated A{beta}-PET.",

These built-in features required the project running a thread-safe python process that used libs like transformers, torch, safetensors, etc. 500M in dependencies, not to mention all the security vulnerabilities in the dep tree. Not hating on python, but our GH project was flagged with all sorts of issues.</p> <p>Those models are loaded as a separate out-of-process server via ollama/lama.cpp which you all know are built in C++/Go. Lighter, faster and safer. And ONLY if the developer uses these features of the product. This meant 9000 lines of less code, a total start time of &lt;2 seconds (vs 30+ seconds), etc.</p> <p>Why archgw? So that you can build AI agents in any language or framework and offload the plumbing work in AI (like agent routing/hand-off, guardrails, zero-code logs and traces, and a unified API for all LLMs) to a durable piece of infrastructure, deployed as a sidecar.</p> <p>Proud of this release, so sharing \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>P.S Sample demos, the CLI and some tests still use python because would be most convenient for developers to interact with the project. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdditionalWeb107\"> /u/AdditionalWeb107 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vpul/archgw_0320_500mbs_of_python_dependencies_gutted/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p5vpul/archgw_0320_500mbs_of_python_dependencies_gutted/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory.

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "title": "Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories",
      "content": "<p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<i>n</i> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes \"switched\" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>",

      "title": "Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Enhances Ca2+-Dependent Electrical Activity in Lateral Cochlear Efferents",
      "content": "<p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (Sitko et al., 2025); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>",
