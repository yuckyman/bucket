      "title": "Gliomas preferentially develop within the action-mode network",
      "content": "Gliomas tend to arise in specific brain regions and may integrate into functional circuits, suggesting they could be regulated by brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether glioma growth is related to system-level brain networks. Analyzing neuroimaging data from three datasets including 1,310 patients with cerebral gliomas, we identified and replicated a functionally connected glioma network, which overlaps with the action-mode network (AMN), somatomotor network (SMN), and action-related subcortical regions. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the AMN successfully predicted the location of glioma occurrence in two independent datasets with complex tumor distributions. Remarkably, no patient had a glioma entirely outside the AMN, and over 89% of patients exhibited gliomas with at least 50% overlap with the network. Moreover, the spatial overlap between glioma location and the AMN demonstrated significant prognostic value in survival analyses, with higher AMN-tumor overlap associated with poorer overall survival. Notably, the acetylcholine transporter, a key player in glioma pathogenesis that drives transcriptional reprogramming, showed an expression pattern overlapping with the AMN. Meta-analytic annotations further linked the glioma network to processes of action initiation, execution, and feedback. These findings indicate that gliomas preferentially arise in circuits involved in action and highlight the central role of the AMN in glioma pathophysiology and growth.",

      "title": "Controllable Point-Light Displays Implemented in a game engine for biological motion research",
      "content": "Biological motion perception plays a critical role in survival and social communication across species. Point-light displays (PLDs), which represent body movement using only a small set of joint markers, have long served as an effective tool for isolating motion cues from other visual features. However, existing methods for generating PLDs, ranging from filmed actors with reflective markers to markerless motion extraction and motion-capture datasets, present limitations in cost, accessibility, flexibility, or ecological validity. In particular, many laboratories lack the resources to create customizable stimuli that allow systematic manipulation of movement parameters. In this article, we introduce a practical and easily modifiable method for producing fully controllable 3D PLDs using freely available animation rigs and the Unity game engine. Our approach enables real-time control of depth cues and directional motion without the need for motion capture equipment or specialized filming environments. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we conducted a psychophysical experiment comparing the perception of biological and non-biological motion. The results replicate the well-documented forward-motion perceptual bias for biological stimuli and highlight differences in how observers interpret motion direction across stimulus classes. This method offers a convenient, accessible, and adaptable tool for research on motion perception and social cognition.",

      "title": "Regional Hypothalamic Responses to Light Vary Across Developmental Stages but Remain Stable with Time of Day",
      "content": "Background: Light plays a significant role in regulating various non-visual biological processes, such as stimulating alertness and cognition. However, the precise subcortical neural pathways are not fully established, including within the hypothalamus. In particular, how the hypothalamus processes are modulated by time-of-day and developmental stages, remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine in vivo the impact of different light illuminance (0.16, 37, 92, and 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance: mel-EDI lux) on the activity of the hypothalamus of healthy young adults (N=33; 20 women; 24.3 +/- 3.2y) and adolescents (N=16; 5 women; 16.8 +/- 1.1y) while they completed an auditory executive task, in the morning or in the evening. Results: Performance to the task improved with increasing illuminance irrespective of time of day and age group. When focusing on time-of-day differences in young adults, we found that the regional impact of light illuminance on the activity of the hypothalamus was consistent between the morning and the evening, with the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, respectively, showing increased and decreased activity with increasing illuminance. When focusing on developmental stages differences, during the evening session only, we found similar regional patterns in adolescents and young adult. The magnitude of the response at the highest illuminance was, however, larger in adolescents, with a larger deactivation of the superior-anterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus. Conclusions: These findings reveal a complex and non-uniform impact of light on hypothalamus activity and provide novel insights into how light influences vary with developmental stages.",

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
