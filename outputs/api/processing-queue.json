      "title": "From Atoms to Neuronal Spikes: A Multi-Scale Simulation Framework",
      "content": "Understanding how molecular events in ion channels impact neuronal excitability, as derived from the calculation of the time course of the membrane potentials, can help elucidate the mechanisms of neurological disease-linked mutations and support neuroactive drug design. Here, we propose a multi-scale simulation approach which couples molecular simulations with neuronal simulations to predict the variations in membrane potential and neural spikes. We illustrate this through two examples. First, molecular dynamics simulations predict changes in current and conductance through the AMPAR neuroreceptor when transitioning from the wild-type protein to certain disease-associated variants. The results of these simulations inform morphologically detailed models of cortical pyramidal neurons, which are simulated using the Arbor framework to determine neural spike activity. Based on these multiscale simulations, we suggest that disease associated AMPAR variants may significantly impact neuronal excitability. In the second example, the Arbor model is coupled with coarse-grained Monte Carlo gating simulations of voltage-gated (K+ and Na+) channels. The predicted current from these ion channels altered the membrane potential and, in turn, the excitation state of the neuron was updated in Arbor. The resulting membrane potential was then fed back into the Monte Carlo simulations of the voltage-gated ion channels, resulting in a bidirectional coupling of current and membrane potential. This allowed the transitions of the states of the ion channels to influence the membrane potentials and vice versa. Our simulations also included the crucial - so far unexplored - effects of the composition of the lipid membrane embedding the ion channels on the membrane potential and revealed a significant impact of temperature on the neuronal excitability. Our combined approaches predicted membrane potentials consistent with electrophysiological recordings and established a multi-scale framework linking the atomistic perturbations to neuronal excitability.",

      "content": "Intermanual transfer refers to the improvement of motor skill in an untrained contralateral limb following unilateral limb practice. However, it remains uncertain whether motor skill in the lower limb (LL) can improve as a result of practice with the unilateral upper limb (UL). Forty-five healthy participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) UL group, which practiced reaching movement (RM) sequences with the non-dominant left upper limb; or (2) switches observation (SO) group, which observed the same RM sequences; or (3) nature observation (NO) group, which observed nature movies. RM performance with the LL was assessed before, immediately after, and 24 h post-intervention. Response time of RM sequences was faster in the UL group than the NO group in the posttest. Response time improved significantly in the posttest and retest compared to the pretest in all groups, but it improved significantly in the retest compared to the posttest only in the NO group. The percentage of fails to reach within 1 s decreased across all time points in all groups. The combination of practice of the RM sequence with the UL and the cognitive engagement during RM sequence observation contributes to ipsilateral transfer from the UL to the LL.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "content": "IntroductionResting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) presents a promising biometric modality due to its inherent liveness detection and resistance to spoofing, addressing critical vulnerabilities in conventional systems. However, its deployment faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and hardware efficiency, particularly concerning optimal electrode configuration, discriminative feature extraction, and classifier generalization.MethodsTo address these challenges, this study systematically evaluates thirteen entropy measures\u2014including spectral entropy (SpEn), refined composite multiscale entropy, fuzzy entropy, and sample entropy (SaEn) etc.\u2014alongside six classifiers (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forests and Support Vector Machines etc.) for person authentication. Using 32-channel EEG recordings from 26 healthy participants under rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), we quantified the impact of electrode selection and feature-classifier pairing.ResultsKey findings demonstrate: QDA classifier achieved peak performance of 96.8% accuracy using 30 electrodes. Critically, a streamlined 9-electrode portable configuration retained 96.1% accuracy, demonstrating robust performance with reduced hardware requirements. SpEn measure exhibited superior biometric discriminability compared with other entropy measures, exceeding SaEn by 13.8 percentage points.ConclusionThese results advance the design of portable EEG biometric devices while highlighting entropy features\u2019 scalability.",

      "content": "Understanding how the human brain differentiates between active engagement and passive observation is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. Using a matched-stimulus driving paradigm to isolate engagement from sensory input, we recorded whole-brain EEG while participants performed a manual control task and passively viewed a replay of their own performance. Manual control elicited distinct spectral signatures, including stronger frontal midline theta power and, paradoxically, greater occipital alpha power, consistent with heightened cognitive control and active attentional filtering. While a classifier could distinguish these states with high within-subject accuracy, performance declined in cross-subject validation, highlighting inter-individual variability. These findings delineate the distinct neural signatures of active versus passive engagement under controlled conditions. This work establishes a foundational neurophysiological baseline that can inform research on cognitive state monitoring and the design of neuroadaptive systems in complex human-machine interaction.",

      "content": "Recent computational, pre-clinical, and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential for using neuromodulation through simultaneous targeting of multiple deep brain regions. This approach has already been used for therapeutic and systems neuroscience applications. However, the broad clinical adoption of invasive distributed deep brain interfaces remains in its early stages. This review explores the barriers to implementation by addressing three key questions: do the benefits of implanting multiple electrodes justify the associated risks for specific applications? What is the risk-benefit ratio, and what technological advancements will be necessary to encourage clinical adoption? We also examine next-generation technologies that could enable multi-target brain interfaces, including system-on-chip micro-stimulators as well as nanoparticles. We highlight the role of novel machine learning algorithms in the optimization of stimulation parameters and for the guidance of device placement. Emerging hardware accelerators equipped with on-chip AI have demonstrated functionality that can be used to decode and to classify distributed neuronal data. This advance in hardware accelerators has also contributed to the potential for enhanced closed-loop stimulation control of devices. Despite these advances, significant technological and translational barriers persist, limiting the widespread clinical application of multi-target brain interfaces. This review provides a critical analysis of recent prototypes and novel hardware for use in multi-target systems. We will discuss both clinical and research applications. We will focus on the utilization of multi-site technologies to meet the needs of neurological diseases. We conclude that there exists a critical need for further innovation and integration of multi-site technologies into clinical practice.",

      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",
