      "title": "Hierarchical Semi-Markov Smooth Models of Latent Neural States",
      "content": "Hidden (semi-) Markov Models (HsMMs) are increasingly being used to segment neurophysiological signals into sequences of latent cognitive processes. The idea: different processes will leave distinct traces in trial-level recordings of (multivariate) neuro-physiological signals. Markov models, equipped with an emission model of these traces and a latent process model describing the progression through the different latent processes involved in a task, can then be used to infer the most likely process for any time-point and trial. However, the currently used HsMMs remain limited in two important ways. First, they cannot account for subject-level heterogeneity in the latent and emission process. Instead, a single group-level model is assumed to explain the entire data. Second, they cannot account for the potentially nonlinear effects of experimental covariates on the latent and emission process. To address these problems, we present a modeling framework in which the HsMM parameters of the emission and latent process are replaced with mixed additive models, including smooth functions of experimental covariates and random effects. We derive all necessary quantities for empirical Bayes and fully Bayesian inference for all parameters and provide a Python implementation of all estimation algorithms. To demonstrate the advantages offered by this framework, we apply such a multi-level model to an existing lexical decision dataset. We show that, even in such a simple task, not all subjects rely on the same processes equally and that at least two semi-Markov states, previously believed to reflect distinct processes, might actually relate to the same cognitive process.",

      "title": "Portable quantum-sensor magnetomyography decodes fine hand movements",
      "content": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are compact quantum sensors that can measure the magnetic fields generated by muscle activity (magnetomyography, MMG) without skin contact. This contact-free alternative to surface electromyography (EMG) has remained mostly confined to magnetically shielded rooms and simple tasks, limiting translation. Here, we show that a portable OPM-MMG system operated inside a compact magnetic shield can robustly decode fine finger movements and recover EMG-like muscle activation patterns. Eight participants executed flexion- extension combinations spanning 15 finger actions while we recorded triaxial MMG and bipolar EMG concurrently. MMG supported robust multi-class and finger-specific decoding, recovering a representational geometry that closely matched EMG. Orientation analyses showed that components orthogonal to the muscle axis contributed most significantly to discriminability, providing actionable guidance for OPM array design. Our results show that OPM-MMG in a portable shielded environment preserves task-relevant neuromuscular information and approaches EMG-level structure without skin contact or a magnetically shielded room. Our findings open a path toward hygienic, rapid-setup assessment and human-machine interfacing in clinics and rehabilitation settings.",

      "content": "Brainstem arousal systems, especially the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system, respond transiently to behaviorally relevant events, which is reflected in pupil dilations. The strength of these pupil-linked arousal responses during encoding of stimulus material predicts the success of its later retrieval. The pupil also dilates in response to task-irrelevant sounds. Here, we evaluated whether the effect of task-irrelevant white noise sounds on pupil-linked arousal can also be used to manipulate memory formation. Task-irrelevant white-noise sounds played before, during or after the presentation of memoranda (images or spoken words) evoked robust pupil dilations. Trial-to-trial variations in the amplitude of pupil responses during word encoding also predicted memory success. Yet, the task-irrelevant sounds did not increase memory success. These sounds may not trigger the same central arousal processes as endogenous variations of arousal that are relevant for memory formation, such as those occurring in states of increased emotionality.",

      "title": "Thalamocortical coupling and cortical E-I balance generate diverse anesthetic \u03b1-spindles for interpretable EEG decoding",
      "content": "Anesthesia is a common clinical procedure, yet its hallmark EEG motifs--spindles oscillating in the broad alpha-range between 4 and 16 Hz--are not enough interpretable from the neuronal circuit perspective and for predictive medicine. To fill this gap, we investigate here the neuronal mechanisms and mathematical principles of brain spindles by recording and modeling large-scale thalamo-cortical neuronal ensembles in mice under anesthesia. We report irregular weakly synchronized firing of thalamic and cortical neurons associated with spindle patterns, indicating an emergent network rather than cellular dynamics. The consecutive loss of balance between the firing of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons and the increased firing fluctuations, together play in favor of larger spindle amplitude. In addition, the continuous range of spindle frequencies observed reflects a tight equilibrium of interactions between the thalamus and cortex. To create a possible numerical twin of this complex dynamics that could be used during clinical anesthesia, we built a computational model that comprises a reciprocally connected excitatory and inhibitory representation of cortical and thalamic networks driven by random fluctuations. The model parsimoniously explains the changes in spindle dynamics when increasing the anesthesia dose. This model thus links in vivo brain sub-network dynamics with EEG for the readout of anesthetized brain states.",

      "title": "Empathy Accelerates Subjective Time Perception, Independent of Physiology but Not of Visual Attention",
      "content": "Recent work suggests that empathic engagement can influence cognitive and perceptual processes, yet its impact on time perception remains unclear. Whereas internal clock models would predict that empathy-induced physiological arousal lengthen perceived duration, other frameworks offer opposite predictions. Specifically, findings that empathy reduces perceived distance, combined with construal level, and motivational dimensional theory, together predict that empathy accelerate the subjective passage of time. Moreover, although eye-movements are crucial in empathy, it remains unclear how visual attention modulates time perception during empathic experiences. Thus, we employed an empathy-for-pain and duration estimation task, while measuring participants heart rate, skin conductance, and eye-movements, to investigate how empathy and physiological arousal influence time perception. Our findings show that empathy leads to a faster perceived passage of time. Despite increases in physiological arousal during empathy, arousal was not associated with changes in time perception. Instead, greater visual attention to the eyes predicted stronger temporal contraction. Furthermore, trait empathy and autism quotient were related to this effect, whereas alexithymia was not. These results provide the first empirical evidence that empathy alters time perception, elucidate the contribution of physiological and visual mechanisms to this phenomenon and extend current theories of time perception and empathy.",

      "content": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) relay visual information to the brain, and their functional properties are crucial for visually guided behavior. However, functional maturation of RGCs across development remains elusive. Here, we investigated the developmental maturation of a genetically defined RGC subtype expressing Satb2 in zebrafish, which allowed single-layer-resolved analysis of the tectal neuropil. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we characterized visual response properties of Satb2-positive RGC axon terminals at two developmental stages. At the early stage, responses segregated into seven functional clusters with diverse tuning profiles. By later stage, these responses reorganized into five clusters, indicating developmental restructuring of functional identities. Longitudinal imaging of individual RGC axons revealed that while some response types remain stable across development, others exhibit pronounced plasticity. In particular, certain RGC cluster acquired additional tuning features and converged into motion-sensitive cluster, coinciding with a marked expansion of motion-responsive cluster and reflecting progressive functional specialization. Visual deprivation experiments revealed that core visual tuning is genetically determined, whereas visual experience is crucial for fine-tuning of the particular functional subtype. Together, our findings provide a single-cell-resolved view of retinal circuit maturation and reveal how stable and flexible responses are integrated during the development of vertebrate vision.",

      "title": "Stimulus sensitivity in noisy neural systems",
      "content": "Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information requires a precise definition of neuronal sensitivity to stimuli. While tuning curves and firing rates offer intuitive insights, theoretical frameworks based on signal-to-noise ratio and decoding efficiency identify Fisher information as the canonical measure of sensitivity, due to its relation with decoding performance. However, this relation holds only under restrictive conditions--when many neurons encode the same stimulus feature or when neural noise is weak. In realistic settings, such as when complex or high-dimensional stimuli are represented by a small ensemble of neurons, Fisher information becomes ill-defined or misleading. To overcome these limitations, we investigate two complementary information-theoretic quantities--the stimulus-specific information (ISSI) and the local information (Iloc)--and propose them as robust alternatives for quantifying sensitivity. We show that ISSI and Iloc converge with Fisher information when signal to noise is large, yet remain meaningful and interpretable beyond that regime. Importantly, these measures capture distinct aspects of sensitivity: ISSI quantifies how observing a response reduces stimulus uncertainty, whereas Iloc reflects how small stimulus perturbations reshape the systems posterior beliefs. Together, they offer a unifying perspective linking information-theoretic and statistical notions of sensitivity, bridging theoretical analysis and experimental investigation of neural coding.",

Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts are indexed by frontal-midline theta ramping",
      "content": "In everyday vision, we often shift attention internally without external cues. These self-initiated attention shifts are fundamental to voluntary behavior but are poorly understood because most studies use cue-based paradigms that predetermine when and where to shift attention. To address this gap, we designed a multi-sequential-choice rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm with identical visual inputs to dissociate internal and external determinants of attention across three voluntary shift types: task-constrained self-initiated, externally instructed, and unconstrained free-viewing. Participants viewed four simultaneous streams of letters and made overt attention shifts among them, while EEG was recorded. We time-locked theta (4\u20137 Hz) and alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations to shift onset and found distinct signatures for each condition. Notably, a frontal-midline theta ramping was observed before self-initiated shifts but not before instructed or free-viewing shifts, suggesting a preparatory buildup of cognitive control specific to internally driven shifts. Concurrently, sustained suppression of posterior alpha occurred before self-initiated shifts. In contrast, instructed and free-viewing shifts showed relatively higher posterior alpha. These findings suggest that internally generated, goal-driven shifts engage an anticipatory frontal control mechanism indexed by theta increase and reduce posterior inhibition, whereas externally cued or unguided shifts do not. By isolating these condition-specific neural dynamics under identical external stimuli, our study identifies a unique oscillatory signature, frontal-midline theta ramping, associated with task-constrained self-initiated attention shifts.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "The sense of agency in near and far space: where do we stand?",
      "content": "Modern technology frequently places the consequences of our actions at a distance (e.g., remote surgery, smart-home control, virtual reality). Does spatial distance between an action and its outcome weaken the sense of agency (SoA) - the feeling of control over one's actions and consequences? Two recent studies answered \"yes\", reporting stronger temporal binding (TB) in near than far space and interpreting this as greater implicit agency (Jenkins & Obhi, 2021; Mariano et al., 2024). A third study - our own work with a similar paradigm - found no distance effect (Kong et al., 2024). Here we (i) provide a rigorous side-by-side methodological comparison of the three studies, (ii) argue why a direct test to establish a distance modulation of TB (the Near - Far difference of the Active - Passive delta) should be performed in order to reach meaningful conclusions, and (iii) report new re-analyses of our data and direct tests on the two target studies. Overall, current evidence does not support a distance effect on SoA. Our reassessment provides alternative explanations that converge with available evidence suggesting that distance may influence temporal interval perception, but that effect is independent of action intention and therefore of agency.",

      "title": "Kv1.3 inhibition alleviates neuropathology via neuroinflammatory and resilience pathways in a mouse model of A\u03b2 pathology",
      "content": "Inhibition of voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 is a therapeutic strategy to curb microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration, although the cellular and signaling mechanisms of disease-modification by Kv1.3 blockers are unclear. In this study, we delineate protective mechanisms of Kv1.3 blockade in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology using comprehensive transcriptomics and proteomics profiling of brain, corresponding with neuropathological effects of two translationally relevant Kv1.3 blockers, namely small molecule PAP-1 and peptide ShK-223. Following 3 months of treatment, both molecules reduced Ab plaque burden. Single nuclear RNA seq (snRNA seq) of brain nuclei showed that PAP-1 disproportionately impacted oligodendrocytes and microglia and increased crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes with endothelial cells. In contrast, ShK-223 had pronounced effects on glutamatergic neurons and astrocytes. Both blockers increased expression of myelination genes in oligodendrocytes and synaptic genes in neurons. Neuroprotective effects of PAP-1 were further confirmed by bulk brain transcriptomics and proteomics whereby PAP-1 increased levels of synaptic, cognitive resilience and mitochondrial proteins, while decreasing glial and immune pathways including STAT1/3 phosphorylation. Using proximity labeling and co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Kv1.3 interacts with STAT1/3 in microglia. Using microglial cell lines and primary microglia, we discovered a preferential functional coupling between Kv1.3 and type 2 but not type 1 IFN signaling. Brain-level disease modification by Kv1.3 blockade was reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via reduced levels of neurofilament-light (NEFL) and resilience protein RPH3A, both of which are increased in human AD CSF. Together, this study demonstrates functional links between Kv1.3 channels and type 2 IFN signaling and reveals distinct cellular effects of Kv1.3 blockers in AD pathology that correspond with reduced neuropathology and neuroinflammation, augmentation of resilience and neuro-vascular pathways, along with biomarkers of therapeutic effect.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",
