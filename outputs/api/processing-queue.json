A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",

      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "title": "Risk of postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events in patients with spontaneous intracranial hematoma stratified by type 2 diabetes mellitus",
      "content": "Background and purposeDiabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common concomitant disease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events (post-MACEs) may diminish the surgical benefits of patients with ICH. However, evidence regarding the impact of DM on post-MACEs remains limited.MethodsThis was a multicenter cohort study that enrolled ICH patients presenting to eight neurosurgery departments between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. Patients were categorized into DM group and no diabetes mellitus (nDM) group, based on the presence or absence of DM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of DM on post-MACEs and 30-days mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. A stratified analysis was also conducted based on the type of post-MACEs.ResultsA total of 688 ICH patients were included in the study, of whom 576 (83.7%) were classified into the nDM group and 112 (16.3%) into the DM group. Compared with the nDM group, the DM group exhibited significantly higher incidences of overall post-MACEs (28.6%), ischemic post-MACEs (14.3%), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (23.2%), and 30-days mortality (9.8%). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, alcohol, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, antiplatelet therapy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, DM remained a significant predictor of overall post-MACEs (OR: 1.790, 95%CI: 1.072\u20132.990, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), ischemic post-MACEs (OR: 2.139, 95%CI: 1.090\u20134.197, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (OR: 1.778, 95%CI: 1.015\u20133.114, p\u202f=\u202f0.044), and 30-days mortality (OR: 3.593, 95%CI: 1.536\u20138.406, p\u202f=\u202f0.003).ConclusionIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that DM serves as a significant risk factor for ischemic post-MACEs, hemorrhagic post-MACEs, and 30-days mortality among patients with ICH.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is closely linked to astrocytes. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of data from a wide range of literature in this field to enhance the in-depth understanding of this area.MethodsPublications were retrieved from the 2000\u20132025 Web of Science Core Collection on January 21, 2025. Bibliometrix-package of R, VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to visualize the research focus and trends.ResultsThe number of citations for the top 100 articles ranged from 208 to 602 citations, with a median of 293 and an average of 331.67 citations per article. The author with the most contributions to this collection was Holtzman David M, who authored 7 papers. Most articles originated in the United States (n\u202f=\u202f69), while Washington University was the institution with the most cited manuscripts (n\u202f=\u202f40). The Journal of Neuroscience contributed the most publications (n\u202f=\u202f15), followed by Nature Neuroscience (n\u202f=\u202f7).

Our analysis highlighted the growing interest in the pathogenesis of astrocytes in AD. Future studies on the mechanisms underlying astrocytes in AD will facilitate further research on new therapeutic approaches.",
