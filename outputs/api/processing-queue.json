      "content": "Radio frequency (RF)-based human activity sensing is an essential component of ubiquitous computing, with WiFi sensing providing a practical and low-cost solution for gesture and activity recognition. However, challenges such as manual data collection, multipath interference, and poor cross-domain generalization hinder real-world deployment. Existing data augmentation approaches often neglect the biomechanical structure underlying RF signals. To address these limitations, we present CM-GR, a...",

      "content": "To address the issues of intense image noise interference and computational intensity faced by traditional vision-based weld tracking systems, we propose WeldLight, a lightweight and noise-resistant convolutional neural network for precise classification and positioning of welding seam feature points using single-line structured light vision. Our approach includes (1) an online data augmentation method to enhance training samples and improve noise adaptability; (2) a one-stage lightweight...",
