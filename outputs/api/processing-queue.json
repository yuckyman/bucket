      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Repetition positivity following auditory intensity or frequency changes in young normal-hearing adults",
      "content": "IntroductionGenerative mechanisms of perception such as predictive coding are used to explain how the brain perceives the world; such mechanisms are often experimentally probed using \u201cdeviant\u201d stimuli that violate established patterns (including mismatch negativity), which also elicit responses related to lower-level processes such as stimulus-specific adaptation. However, little is still known about brain responses that indicate the strength of sensory predictions or reinforcement of sensory representations. Repetition positivity (RP) is a positive polarity evoked potential that gradually increases with each repetition of a stimulus, and is thought to reflect progressive strengthening of auditory sensory memory and/or habituation to repetitive stimuli. The aim of this study was to compare RP that follows a change in stimulus frequency with that following a change in stimulus intensity, the latter having not previously been studied.MethodsWe used roving sequences of isochronous 5 kHz pure tones (300 ms duration, 300ms inter-stimulus interval), which changed in frequency by 1 kHz (Experiment 1) or in intensity by 12 dB (Experiment 2) after every 30 stimuli. All changes were roving, such that an increase would be followed by a decrease, and vice versa.ResultsEvent-related potentials recorded with EEG indicated that frequency changes in either direction were followed by RP, whilst only intensity increases were followed by RP, and only a weak visual trend toward RP was apparent for intensity decreases. Observed RP was best explained by a logarithmic function over successive stimuli.ConclusionsRP robustly follows increases, but not necessarily decreases, in stimulus intensity, which appears smaller in amplitude than that elicited by similarly salient frequency changes, and reaches a plateau sooner. These observations offer insight into how intensity is processed similarly yet differently to other sensory attributes in an adaptive or predictive coding framework, and might have future utility in the study of clinical conditions related to aberrant predictive mechanisms.",

      "title": "Peripheral and central auditory dysfunction, cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and cognitive performance in community-dwelling older adults: a cross-sectional study",
      "content": "ObjectivesBoth age-related peripheral or central hearing loss, and cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM), which are independent association with global and domain-specific cognitive impairment, are common among older adults. Cardiometabolic diseases also are independent risk factors of age-related hearing loss. The first aim of the study was to investigate the independent and joint influence of CMM and low- and high-frequency hearing loss or central auditory processing dysfunction (CAPD) on global and domain-specific cognitive impairment. The second aim was to investigate whether CMM mediate the effects of age-related hearing loss on cognitive performance.MethodsIn total, 508 eligible community-dwelling dementia-free older adult participants agreed to participate and completed a cross-sectional investigation. The averages of thresholds at 0.5, 1, and 2\u202fkHz for low frequency (LPTA) and at 4, 6, and 8\u202fkHz for high frequency (HPTA) were calculated. CAPD was assessed using SNR (signal-to-noise ratio threshold) in a words-in-noise test. Global and domain-specific cognitive performance was measured using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. This study analyzed the independent associations between LPTA, HPTA, CAPD, or CMM and global and domain-specific cognitive performance after adjusting for each other and other confounders. Weighted logistic regression were used to assess the joint effects of CMM and the LPTA, HPTA, or CAPD on cognitive performance. The R package \u201cMediation\u201d was used to examine whether CMM mediated the associations between LPTA, HPTA, or CAPD and cognitive performance.ResultsCMM was independently associated with global cognitive performance in pre-MCI [\u03b2 (95% CI): 0.124 (0.047, 0.202), adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.0068], MCI groups [0.131 (0.055, 0.206), adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.068] for total sample, and the sensitivity test (adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.0506, and 0.012, respectively) after adjusted for all confounders. CMM in Model 2 was also significantly associated with executive function in the sensitivity test (\u03b2, 0.087; 95% CI, 0.028, 0.145; adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.035). The SNR value and global cognition in Model 2 was significantly associated between the cognitively normal group and the MCI group (adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.044 in total sample, and p\u202f=\u202f0.051 in sensitivity test). HPTA in Model 2 remained independently associated with attention/executive function in the sensitivity test (\u03b2, 0.005; 95% CI, 0.001, 0.008; adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.0395). The dose\u2013response relationships between the LPTA, HPTA, or SNR and CMM on global cognition were most significant in the cognitively normal group than in the MCI group. The significant joint effect of CMM and HPTA on executive function also been observed. In the sensitivity test, the indirect mediation effect of HPTA on global cognitive performance in the MCI group vs. the cognitively normal group after adjustments for all confounders through CMM were significant. Approximately 16.172% of the total effect of HPTA on global cognition was explained by the mediation effect through CMM.ConclusionCMM and CAPD were significantly associated with global cognition. CMM and HPTA were significantly associated executive function in the sensitivity test. CMM, and LPTA, HPTA, or CAPD had jointly effects on global cognition. CMM and HPTA had significant joint effect on executive function. CMM might mediate the association between the HPTA and global or executive function in individuals with LPTA \u2264 40\u202fdB HL. These findings indicated that an integrated interventional approach for presbycusis and CMM simultaneously may delay cognitive decline in older adults.",

I wrote a custom `useMarketEngine.ts` hook that runs a discrete-event simulation. Every \"run cycle,\" it solves a system of equations, including a specific Ad Fatigue formula\u2014`1 / (1 + (power - 1) * fatigueFactor)`\u2014to force diminishing returns.<p>I also coded the \"Theory of Constraints\" directly into the state management: the system enforces bottlenecks between Inventory, Demand, and Capacity. For instance, a single employee has a hard cap of 7 operations per day. If you scale demand beyond that without hiring, the system burns your cash on lost orders.<p>To handle the educational content, I moved away from hardcoded quizzes.<p>I built a module that pipes the static lesson text into Gemini Flash to generate unique \"Combat Cases\" on the fly. The AI validates your strategy against the specific principles of the lesson (like LTV/CAC) rather than generic business advice.<p>These two engines are connected by a \"Liquidity Loop.\"<p>Passing the AI cases earns you virtual capital ($500), which is the only fuel for the Market Engine. You literally cannot play the game if you don't learn the theory.<p>If you go bankrupt, my heuristic `Advisor` analyzes your crash data\u2014comparing `lostRevenue` vs `lostCapacity`\u2014and links you back to the exact lesson you ignored.<p>I am inviting you to test the full loop: read a brief, pass the AI simulation (Combat Cases ), and try to survive in the Market Engine.<p>I specifically need feedback on:\n1. The Content: I aimed for maximum density\u2014are the lessons <i>too</i> dry?\n2. The AI Simulation: Does it accurately validate your logic based on the lesson?\n3. The Market Economy: Does the math feel balanced, or is the \"Ad Fatigue\" too punishing?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46641992\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46641992</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

If you\u2019re jumping between dozens of boxes, many of which might be destroyed an hour later, your \"local memory\" (the history file) is essentially useless. This tool builds a centralized, permanent brain for your shell activity, ensuring that a complex one-liner you crafted months ago remains accessible even if the server it ran on is long gone.<p>The core mechanism wants to be a \"zero-touch\" capture that happens at the connection gateway level. Instead of installing logging agents or scripts on every target machine, the tool reconstructs your terminal sessions from raw recording files generated by the proxy you use to connect. This \"in-flight\" capture means you get a high-fidelity log of every keystroke and output without ever having to touch the configuration of the remote host. It\u2019s a passive way to build a personal knowledge base while you work.<p>To handle the reality of context-switching, the tool is designed with a \"multi-tenant\" architecture. For an individual engineer, this isn't about managing different users, but about isolating project contexts. It automatically categorizes history based on the specific organization or project tags defined at the gateway. This keeps your work for different clients or personal side-projects in separate buckets, so you don't have to wade through unrelated noise when you're looking for a specific solution.<p>In true nerd fashion, the search interface stays exactly where you want it: in the command line. There is no bloated web UI to slow you down. The tool turns your entire professional history into a searchable, greppable database accessible directly from your terminal.<p>Please read the full story [here](<a href=\"https://carminatialessandro.blogspot.com/2026/01/hc-agentless-multi-tenant-shell-history.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://carminatialessandro.blogspot.com/2026/01/hc-agentles...</a>)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46644250\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46644250</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

PDC Struct uses standard Pydantic models, so you get: - Native Python type hints - Pydantic validation, serialization, JSON schema - IDE autocomplete and type checking - Familiar class-based syntax</p> <p><strong>vs. <code>dataclasses</code> + manual packing</strong></p> <p>You could use dataclasses and write your own <code>to_bytes()</code>/<code>from_bytes()</code> methods, but that's boilerplate for every struct. PDC Struct handles it automatically.</p> <hr /> <p>Happy to answer any questions or hear feedback. The library has comprehensive docs with examples for ARP packet parsing, C interop, and IoT sensor communication.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/9011442\"> /u/9011442 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qe2hfx/pdc_struct_pydanticpowered_binary_serialization/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qe2hfx/pdc_struct_pydanticpowered_binary_serialization/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Also, I'm simultaneously deploying to web and desktop, and streamlit lets me do this with just the one codebase (I intend to use something like PyInstaller for distribution)</p> <p>I have different &quot;<a href=\"https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/layout/st.expander\">expanders</a>&quot; in my streamlit application. Each expander has some data/input elements in it (in the case of my most recent problem, it's a <code>data_editor</code>). Sometimes, I need one element to update in response to the user clicking on &quot;Save Changes&quot; in a different part of the application. If they were both in the same fragment, I could just do <code>st.rerun(scope='fragment')</code>. But since they're not, I have no other choice but to do <code>st.rerun()</code>. But if there's incorrect input, I write an error message, which gets subsequently erased due to the rerun. Now I know that I can store this stuff in <code>st.session_state</code> and add additional logic to &quot;recreate&quot; the (prior) error-message state of the app, but that adds a lot of complexity.</p> <p>Since there is no way to <code>st.rerun()</code> a different fragment than the one I'm in, it looks like I have to give up streamlit - about time, I've been writing workarounds/hacks for a lot of streamlit stumbling blocks.</p> <p>So, would anyone be able to recommend an alternative to streamlit? These are the criteria to determine viability of an alternative:</p> <ol> <li>ability to control the layout of my elements and programmatically refresh specific elements on demand</li> <li>web and desktop deployments from the same codebase <ol> <li>bonus points for being able to handle mobile deployments as well</li> </ol></li> <li>Python API - I can learn another language if the learning curve is fast. That takes Node/React out of the realm of possibility</li> <li>somewhat mature - I started using streamlit back in v0.35 or so. But now I'm using v1.52. While streamlit hasn't been around for as long as React, v1.52 is sufficiently mature. I doubt a flashy new frontend framework (eg: with current version 0.43) would have had enough time to iron out the bugs if it's only been around for a very short period of time (eg: 6 months).</li> <li>ideally something you have experience with and can therefore speak confidently to its stability/reliability</li> </ol> <p>I'm currently considering: 1. <a href=\"https://flet.dev/\">flet</a>: hasn't been around for very long - anyone know if it's any good? 1. <a href=\"https://nicegui.io\">NiceGUI</a> 1. <a href=\"https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex\">Reflex</a></p> <p>If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I'd love them</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/inspectorG4dget\"> /u/inspectorG4dget </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qdz1qu/please_recommend_a_frontend_frameworkpackage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qdz1qu/please_recommend_a_frontend_frameworkpackage/\">[comments]</a></span>",
