      "title": "Birth by Cesarean Section Remodels Neonatal Brain Barriers and Associated Immune and Metabolic Pathways in Mice",
      "content": "Mode of delivery shapes early-life physiology through multiple pathways, including stress and hormonal signalling, neonatal oxygenation, and exposure to maternal microbes. Cesarean section (CS) bypasses several of these processes and has been associated with altered immune maturation and neurodevelopmental outcomes in humans and animal models. Given that CS is also known to disrupt gut barrier integrity and that gut and brain barriers operate as a coordinated network, we investigated whether CS-associated changes extend to early postnatal brain barriers. Using a mouse model, we compared CS-delivered pups with vaginally born (VB) controls at postnatal days 8-9. Brain barrier permeability and cellular architecture were assessed using tracer extravasation and vascular and tight junction analysis, choroid plexus immune populations were profiled, and metabolomic profiling was performed in cortex and plasma. Blood-brain barrier structural readouts in the medial prefrontal cortex were mostly preserved. In contrast, the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) exhibited structural alterations in both its vascular and epithelial tight junction compartments. These barrier changes were accompanied by immune remodelling, including expansion of antigen-presenting border-associated macrophages and reduced parenchymal microglia density. CS delivery increased brain tracer accumulation, consistent with altered barrier function during this developmental window. Metabolomic profiling further identified lower levels of key brain metabolites, including N-acetylaspartate, a marker of neuronal metabolic state. Together, these findings demonstrate that CS delivery induces early alterations in brain barrier function, BCSFB structure, immune landscape, along with brain and plasma metabolic profiles in mice. This identifies delivery mode as a key perinatal variable shaping neonatal brain physiology and establishes a framework for dissecting how birth context may influence long-term neurodevelopmental trajectories.",

      "title": "Revisiting the SSRI-TRKB Mechanism: Lack of Evidence for Interaction in the Human Brain",
      "content": "Direct binding of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to the TRKB receptor has been revealed as a novel mode of action for SSRIs. However, micromolar SSRI concentrations are required for this interaction to produce measurable effects in vitro and in vivo in animal models. Here, we highlight that measurements of human blood and cerebrospinal fluid from chronically treated patients reveal only nano- to picomolar SSRI levels. Rodent electrophysiological studies show that micromolar SSRI concentrations disrupt multiple ion channel functions, and we demonstrate that exposure of human neurons to micromolar concentrations leads to significantly reduced activity at 1 uM and complete silencing at 10 uM-concentrations required to exert effects by direct SSRI low-affinity binding to TRKB in animals. Together, clinical measurements, animal electrophysiological studies, and our human neuro-electrophysiology data question whether the low SSRI concentrations achieved in patients have any consequences through their low-affinity binding to TRKB receptors. The micromolar concentrations required for effects elicit by SSRI-TRKB direct interaction are not reached under therapeutic conditions and, as our data show, would instead presumably lead to a near-complete loss of neuronal activity in humans.",

      "title": "Nutritional Protection Against Antipsychotic-Related Brain Injury: Combined Omega-3 and Vitamin E Effects on the Cerebellum",
      "content": "Haloperidol is a widely used typical antipsychotic for schizophrenia but is associated with neurotoxic effects mediated by oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and neuronal disruption. Omega 3 fatty acids possess anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties while vitamin E is a potent lipid-soluble antioxidant. Although each has shown protective effects individually, their combined efficacy against haloperidol induced cerebellar toxicity remains poorly understood. This study investigated the neuroprotective effects of co-administered omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin E on haloperidol induced behavioural biochemical and histological alterations in the rat cerebellum. Sixty male Wistar rats (80 to100 g) were randomly assigned to six groups (n = 10). Control animals received a standard diet and olive oil while treatment groups received omega 3 fatty acids (500 mg/kg of feed), vitamin E (10 IU/kg, orally), haloperidol (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), or their combinations for 28 days. Haloperidol-treated rats showed significant reductions in body weight, feed intake, locomotor activity, rearing, and spatial working memory, alongside increased grooming behaviour and catalepsy (p < 0.05). These behavioural deficits were markedly attenuated by omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E, particularly when administered together. Haloperidol also increased malondialdehyde and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) while reducing total antioxidant capacity, indicating heightened oxidative stress and inflammation. Co-treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E significantly reversed these biochemical alterations. Histological analysis revealed pronounced cerebellar neuronal degeneration in haloperidol-only rats, whereas cerebellar architecture was largely preserved in co-treated groups. Overall, combined omega-3 fatty acid and vitamin E supplementation provided significant neuroprotection against haloperidol-induced cerebellar toxicity and motor impairment, supporting their potential role as adjunct therapies in reducing antipsychotic-related neurodegeneration.",
