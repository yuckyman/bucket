      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

(2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "title": "Opticol: memory optimized python collections",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I just created a new library called <a href=\"https://github.com/lessico/opticol/\">opticol</a> (which stands for optimized collections), which I wanted to share with the community. The idea of the library is to create space optimized versions of Sequence, Set, and Mapping for small collections leveraging the collections.ABC vocabulary.</p> <h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>Creates optimized versions of the main python collection types (Sequence, Set, Mapping) along with vocabulary types and convenience methods for transforming builtins to the optimized type.</p> <p>For collections of size 3 or less, it is pretty trivial (using slots) to create an object that can act as a collection, but uses notably less memory than the builtins. Consider the fact that an empty set requires 216 bytes, or a dictionary with one element requires 224 bytes. Applications that create many (on the order of 100k to a million) of these objects can substantially reduce their memory usage with this library.</p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>This will benefit users who use Python for various forms of data analysis. These problems often have many collection instances, which can often be just a few items. I myself have run into issues with memory pressure like this with some NLP datasets. Additionally, this is helpful for those doing this primarily in Python or for situations where dropping to a lower level language is not advantageous yet.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>I could not find a similar library to this, nor even discussion of implementing such an idea. I would be happy to update this section if something comes up, but as far as I know, there are no direct comparisons.</p> <p>Anyway, it's currently a beta release as I'm working on finishing up the last unit tests, but the main use case generally works. I'm also very interested in any feedback on the project itself or other optimizations that may be good to add!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/matgrioni\"> /u/matgrioni </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhl2o2/opticol_memory_optimized_python_collections/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qhl2o2/opticol_memory_optimized_python_collections/\">[comments]</a></span>",
