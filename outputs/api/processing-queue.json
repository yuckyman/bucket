      "title": "Exogenous spatial attention is functional in paralytic strabismics",
      "content": "IntroductionThe absence of exogenous cueing effects in patients with paralytic strabismus has been cited as evidence for an obligate linkage between movement execution and attentional allocation.MethodsThe present study challenges this interpretation through two experiments that measured the impact of visual cues, intended to facilitate or inhibit shifts of spatial attention, on the latencies of target-directed responses. By including a no-cue control condition, we assessed both the presence and direction of cue-induced attentional modulation.ResultsOur results show that all patients\u2019 patterns of saccadic (Experiment I) and keypress (Experiment II) response latencies showed classic signatures of cue-target interactions: movements initiated in response to targets spatially proximate to cues were initiated fastest whereas movements initiated toward targets spatially distal from cues were initiated slowest. This trend held true when grouping latencies by cue-saccade offset to account for small errors in saccade landing position in Experiment I. Though the patients\u2019 data exhibited small degrees of idiosyncrasy, most patients\u2019 mean normalized latencies also fell within the range of latencies observed in non-strabismic participants.DiscussionThese findings support the notion that premotor structures may program attentional shifts in an effector-independent manner and motivate future investigations to explore how, not if, exogenous spatial attention is deployed in paralytic strabismics.",

      "content": "The photothrombotic stroke model is gaining popularity due to its relative simplicity, minimal invasiveness, and clinical relevance. Photothrombosis involves the delivery of an intravascular photosensitizer (Rose Bengal) followed by its photoactivation, resulting in vessel occlusion and ischemia. Using a combination of complementary optical and non-optical techniques, we characterized the physiological changes in mice undergoing photothrombosis. We report that Rose Bengal acts as a rapid vasoconstrictor, inducing hypoemia both in the brain and periphery even in the absence of its photoactivation. Conversely, we find that light, when used at photothrombosis-appropriate intensities and durations, induces large amounts of tissue heating and hyperemia even in the distal non-illuminated hemisphere. Furthermore, we show that use of the optimal photothrombotic wavelength based on the Rose Bengal absorption spectrum (yellow-561nm) produces a more consistent and pronounced drop in blood flow, and a shorter latency to the initial spreading depolarization (SD), ultimately resulting in a larger stroke. Similarly, when yellow light is used to induce a stroke in ChR2-expressing mice, the electrophysiological and hemodynamic confounds from green light cross activation of ChR2 are eliminated. Finally, we observe across cohorts that male mice have larger strokes than females. Altogether, we extensively describe important caveats and confounds concerning photothrombosis and provide a detailed characterization of its early ischemic events.",

      "title": "Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) for spastic cerebral palsy",
      "content": "BackgroundGait abnormalities in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) result from four primary neuromuscular impairments: muscle weakness, short muscle-relative-to-skeletal-length, muscle spasticity, and impaired selective motor control. The Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) was developed to help clinicians identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP for use in any clinical setting.AimsThis study evaluated use and validity of the observational-based Clinical GENI to identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in children with spastic CP.MethodsPatients with spastic CP seen in 2023 for instrumented gait analysis and physical exam of neuromuscular impairments were evaluated using the Clinical GENI. Validity was assessed by agreement between identification of gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI compared to 3D gait kinematics. Severity of neuromuscular impairments associated with gait abnormalities listed on the Clinical GENI was compared, and severity of neuromuscular impairment was correlated with severity of gait abnormalities.ResultsParticipants included 12 children with spastic CP (4 GMFCS I, 8 GMFCS II; mean age 11.25 years). The most common gait abnormalities were forefoot/flatfoot initial contact (IC) (16/24), flexed-knee IC (19/24), hip-flexion in single limb stance (12/24), and reduced pre-swing ankle plantarflexion (19/24). Strong agreement (83\u2013100%) occurred between gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI and kinematic values. Severity of neuromuscular impairment was higher (p < 0.05) for those with gait abnormalities vs. without and correlated to severity of gait abnormalities in a majority of comparisons.ConclusionResults support clinical utility and validity of the Clinical GENI for evaluating gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP.",
