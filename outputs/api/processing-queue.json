      "title": "Tell HN: Regrets. Think carefully about how you spend your time",
      "content": "<p>I'm writing this 38 hours before I go into a surgery on Monday that I may not survive, and while I am told I have a better than 50/50 chance of making it to this time next year, I still feel, though I am too young (early 50s) to deal with these things, that I have wasted too much time. I'd like to impart some lessons.<p>1. A small number of accomplishments really mean something, but you often won't know which ones. I started three companies and two were successes, and even though they comprised more than two decades of my life, I feel like I remember a grand total of six important hours between them. Meanwhile, I still remember the shed I built for my father in the first summer after college. Whatever seems unimportant, you will care about the most.<p>2. The thing you do today, you will probably do tomorrow. I've wasted a lot of time, but most people I know have wasted lots of time, and it's because of the tendency to make an exception of the present day, which either excuses laziness or pathological busyness, which is a form of the same thing. \"I'll do it tomorrow.\" But tomorrow it will be today. It's always today.<p>3. Ethics matter. I don't believe there's any life after this one, but I find myself ruminating on what I've done. In 2015, I had a lot of interaction with a startup incubator you know well, and ended up sitting in the discussions and planning around banning and erasing a young programmer we considered a threat to our financial interests, due to his concerns about authoritarianism in technology. In retrospect, he was harmless, but an example had to be made. The decision was made to ban him here, try to get him fired though I don't know if we succeeded, and attack him with sockpuppets on Reddit, and it seems to have worked because you don't hear his name much.<p>Ten years later, I'm still stuck thinking about this. Am I the kind of person who does shitty things? I was. Am I still? How would I even know?<p>I don't believe that faith is an out, or that you can apologize or donate your way out of past behaviors. You will always be the person who has done what you have done.<p>4. Be kind to animals. There are few joys like having a dog. I always refused when my ex-wife wanted one, and she got one after we separated. For her, it was probably an upgrade.<p>5. I developed a knack for founding companies, but I never learned how to build communities. They aren't the same thing. You might have three hundred people at your company and you truly feel like they are your village, but they're not. Circumstances will change, and people will move, and in five years, most of them will not remember your name.<p>That's probably enough for now. My mind goes between periods of racing and long spells of languid acceptance. All humans end up in the place where I am, and I hope you reach it with fewer regrets than I have.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46092688\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46092688</a></p>\n<p>Points: 84</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>",

      "title": "Flexible selection of working memory representations to reduce cognitive cost",
      "content": "Across psychology, economics, and decision science, it is well established that choosing a good internal representation can make complex problems easier to solve. This idea, central to theories of bounded rationality and heuristics, suggests that intelligent behavior depends not only on what is stored in working memory, but on the format in which it is stored. Whether non-human animals flexibly select internal formats, and how such choices are implemented in neural circuits, has remained unclear. Here we show that rats adjust the format of working memory to reduce cognitive load. When a task encourages an action-based code, rats maintain the relevant information as a stable motor plan supported by frontal cortex. When the same task is reformulated to make this code costly, they instead store a sensory trace in auditory cortex. These strategy shifts are rapid and reliable, revealing that rats can switch between distinct neural circuits to store information in the most economical internal format. These results demonstrate that flexible representational selection is not unique to humans but is present in rodents and reflected in circuit-level reallocation of working memory. This establishes a neural basis for classic theories linking problem representation to computational efficiency and provides a path toward a neural circuit-level description of selecting internal formats to reduce cognitive costs.",

      "title": "High-Frequency Activity Encodes the Temporal Dynamics of Hierarchical Prediction Errors in Humans: An Electrocorticography Study",
      "content": "Prediction error refers to the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory input. Its hierarchical organization has been demonstrated through decomposed brain responses in the local-global paradigm, where temporal regularities are established locally at individual stimulus transitions and globally across multi-tone sequence structures. In macaques and marmosets, local and global prediction-error signals have both been found in high-frequency oscillations (60-150 Hz) recorded with ECoG. In humans, however, these signals have primarily been observed in a lower frequency range (30-100 Hz) using EEG. Here, we recorded human ECoG to achieve higher signal fidelity, enabling examination of neural oscillations above 100 Hz (high-frequency activity, HFA), which are believed to be closely linked to local spiking activity. Eight participants listened to auditory sequences that either followed their local and global regularities (local and global standards) or violated them (local and global deviants). Robust HFA responses were observed for the local deviants, but these responses were reduced when the deviants were expected based on the global regularity, indicating both levels of prediction-error processes contribute to the observed activity. Importantly, these HFA responses could be decomposed into two subcomponents: an early component reflecting local prediction-error signals localized to lateral auditory regions, and a late component reflecting global prediction-error signals prominent in both lateral auditory and frontal cortices. Together, these findings demonstrate that neural oscillations above 100 Hz encode hierarchical prediction errors not only in non-human primates but also in humans.",

      "title": "Top-down feedback can explain the existence of working memory traces in early visual cortex",
      "content": "The temporary storage of visual memories is known to engage early visual cortex (EVC), where mnemonic content is presumed to be stored in weak or latent states. Two mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this storage: Top-down feedback from anterior cortical sites, and short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) traces laid down by previous sensory inputs. Here, we tested if these mechanisms can account for two hallmarks of working memory, namely, the flexible selection of information from working memory, and the robustness of working memory against distraction. Simulating firing rates in a neural network model of working memory, we show that STSP cannot easily account for selection of information from within the working memory store, and is not robust to visual distraction. Rather, any input that passes through the visual system is briefly remembered, irrespective of its relevance. In contrast, top-down feedback can establish durable mnemonic signals in EVC that reflect currently task-relevant working memory contents and are robust to distraction. We argue that feedback is a parsimonious explanation for the existence of mnemonic signals in EVC, given that the storage of working memories is distributed across a hierarchy of cortical sites, which are known to have widespread feedback projections to visual cortex.",

      "title": "Predicting functional topography of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy at scale",
      "content": "Topographic organization is a fundamental principle of the brain, whereby adjacent cortical locations represent adjacent features in sensory or cognitive space. Current methodologies for obtaining individual-specific topographic maps either require resource-intensive functional neuroimaging data or, when using population atlases, lack precision for individual-level inference, limiting large-scale studies of individual differences. Here, we developed deepRetinotopy toolbox, a deep learning-based application for predicting topographic organization of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy. We show that our toolbox accurately predicts retinotopic organization using only standard structural MRI scans acquired under diverse conditions, including varying imaging sites and scanner types. We then demonstrate that predicted maps can be leveraged to automatically generate individual-specific visual area boundaries, overcoming common biases in manual annotations. Finally, we estimate age-related changes in visual cortex organization by retrospectively applying our method to 11,060 anatomical scans, revealing that group differences in primary visual cortex organization are predictable from cortical anatomy.",
