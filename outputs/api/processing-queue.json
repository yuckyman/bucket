      "title": "Data- and Physics-Driven Deep Learning Based Reconstruction for Fast MRI: Fundamentals and Methodologies",
      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "title": "Development of Mental Models in Human-AI Collaboration: A Conceptual Framework",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.08104v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence has become integral to organizational decision-making and while research has explored many facets of this human-AI collaboration, the focus has mainly been on designing the AI agent(s) and the way the collaboration is set up - generally assuming a human decision-maker to be \"fixed\". However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models (domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.",

      "title": "Quantifying Locomotion Differences Between Virtual Reality Users With and Without Motor Impairments",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.07987v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Today's virtual reality (VR) systems and environments assume that users have typical abilities, which can make VR inaccessible to people with physical impairments. However, there is not yet an understanding of how inaccessible locomotion techniques are, and which interactions make them inaccessible. To this end, we conducted a study in which people with and without upper-body impairments navigated a virtual environment with six locomotion techniques to quantify performance differences among groups. We found that groups performed similarly with Sliding Looking on all performance measures, suggesting that this might be a good default locomotion technique for VR apps. To understand the nature of performance differences with the other techniques, we collected low-level interaction data from the controllers and headset and analyzed interaction differences with a set of movement-, button-, and target-related metrics. We found that movement-related metrics from headset data reveal differences among groups with all techniques, suggesting these are good metrics for identifying whether a user has an upper-body impairment. We also identify movement-, button, and target- related metrics that can explain performance differences between groups for particular locomotion techniques.",

      "title": "Pre/Absence: Prompting Cultural Awareness and Understanding for Lost Architectural Heritage in Virtual Reality",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.07967v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Lost architectural heritage presents interpretive challenges due to vanished structures and fragmented historical records. Using Hanyuan Hall of the Tang dynasty's Daming Palace as a case study, we conducted a formative investigation with archaeologists, heritage administrators, and visitors to identify key issues in current interpretation practices. We found that these practices often compress complex cultural layers into factual summaries and rely on linear narratives that overlook the continuing reinterpretations following a site's disappearance. In response, we designed Pre/Absence, a virtual reality experience grounded in the presence-absence dialectic to interweave tangible and vanished aspects of heritage within a spatiotemporal narrative. A mixed-method study with 28 participants compared Pre/Absence to a paper-based experience. Both improved users' factual understanding, but the VR experience more strongly enhanced cultural awareness, evoked emotional engagement with loss, and encouraged critical reflection on the evolving social and political meanings of heritage. The findings suggest that VR can move beyond static reconstruction to engage users as co-constructors of cultural meaning, providing a nuanced framework for critical heritage narrative design in human-computer interaction.",
