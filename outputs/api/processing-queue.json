It provides three interfaces:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Web Interface</strong> \u2013 An interactive map-based UI (<code>niceGUI</code>) to visually search and filter satellite products by location, date range, and cloud cover. <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto/blob/main/docs/assets/vresto_demo.gif\">Demo here</a></li> <li><strong>Python API</strong> \u2013 Clean, programmatic access for automation and batch processing</li> <li><strong>CLI</strong> \u2013 Command-line tools for quick searches and downloads</li> </ol> <p>Key capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Search satellite products by name or geographic location</li> <li>Download individual spectral bands (RGB, infrared, etc.) for analysis and artifact detection</li> <li>Access metadata and quicklook previews</li> <li>Inspect and visualize Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A imagery (with support for more coming later)</li> <li>Handle S3 authentication securely</li> </ul> <h1>Why I built this</h1> <p>This came from a real need when exploring and cleaning large satellite datasets for ML model training: researchers and developers need a fast, intuitive way to find <strong>individual</strong> products, inspect their bands for quality issues, and download specific data\u2014without context-switching between multiple tools and programming languages.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li><strong>ML/AI researchers</strong> \u2013 Building datasets from satellite imagery and need to explore/clean individual products</li> <li><strong>Geospatial researchers &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Analyzing multispectral imagery for environmental monitoring, agriculture, or climate research</li> <li><strong>GIS developers &amp; engineers</strong> \u2013 Building Python applications that need streamlined satellite data discovery and access</li> <li><strong>Data analysts &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Working with remote sensing data for analysis and visualization</li> <li><strong>Hobbyists &amp; enthusiasts</strong> \u2013 Anyone curious about satellite data and earth observation</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>The most popular alternatives to searching Satellite products with Python (and offering a CLI) are <a href=\"https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag\">eodag</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/CDSETool/CDSETool\">CDSETool</a>. The former seems to be a quite mature project with a complete suite that goes beyond the scope of &quot;single products&quot;, while the latter focuses more on product downloads. Neither offers an intuitive web interface like that of vresto. However, an integration with <code>eodag</code> could be interesting in the future to combine the best of both worlds.</p> <h1>How It Works</h1> <p><code>vresto</code> is built on top of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem catalog, providing an intuitive Python-first interface for the most common tasks: finding individual products, examining their metadata and spectral bands, and downloading what you need. Whether you prefer clicking on a map, writing a few lines of Python, or using the CLI, <code>vresto</code> keeps you focused on the data rather than the infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udd17 <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto\">github.com/kalfasyan/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udcd6 <strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://kalfasyan.github.io/vresto\">kalfasyan.github.io/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udce6 <strong>PyPI:</strong> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/vresto/\">pypi.org/project/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f <strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/\">Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Free Copernicus account required (get one at dataspace.copernicus.eu).

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "A shared ensemble in the prelimbic cortex links impulsivity and anxiety-like behavior.",
      "content": "Mental health disorders often share overlapping behavioral and neural features, yet it remains unclear why these relationships emerge or whether they reflect common underlying neural processes. To explore this, we recorded prelimbic (PL) activity using endoscopic calcium imaging as rats completed a battery of tasks assessing impulsivity, distress tolerance, anxiety-like behavior, incentive salience (Pavlovian conditioned approach), and sensation-seeking in a novel environment (locomotor activity). By collecting neural and behavioral measures across all tasks within each animal, we were able to investigate whether PL activity tracked processes that were either unique to individual behaviors, shared across multiple behaviors, or both. We found that PL activity was significantly predictive of each of the behaviors except locomotor activity. Subsequent analyses revealed shared behavioral structure across tasks, with one latent dimension reflecting high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. Individual variability across this particular dimension was strongly predicted by a neural structure comprising shared PL activity across four of the behaviors. Furthermore, this relationship was driven by a subset of PL neurons that shared patterns of activity across multiple tasks, forming a shared neural ensemble. Importantly, animals with a greater tendency to share neural ensembles exhibited a stronger link between high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that a small, shared ensemble of PL neurons tracked activity across multiple clinically-relevant behaviors to predict an approach/avoidance phenotype characterized by high impulsivity and low anxiety. This points toward a targetable neural population that may help explain why diverse psychiatric symptoms often co-occur within individuals.",

      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "content": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in cellular development and differentiation across species. Although the importance of miRNAs in oligodendrocyte lineage cell (OLLC) differentiation has been extensively studied in rodent models, their roles in human OL development remain less understood. To address this gap, we used a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter system designed to study human OLs and OL progenitor cells (OPCs). Using an optimized differentiation protocol, we used the reporter hESCs to generate and isolate well-characterized OLLCs at specific developmental stages and performed next-generation sequencing-based miRNA profiling to identify stage-specific miRNAs enriched during OL lineage specification and maturation. In addition to canonical miRNAs known to be enriched at various stages of OL development, our study identified several lesser-known miRNAs with distinct stage-specific enrichment patterns that may serve as useful molecular markers for classifying human CNS cell types in future studies. Target analysis of OPC- and OL-enriched miRNAs revealed key genes, including transcription factors ZNF488 and DLX1, cytoskeletal regulator CSNK2B, and potassium channel gene KCNJ1, along with key signaling pathways such as AKT, SMAD2/3, estrogen receptor, and insulin signaling, which regulate OPC and OL lineage function. These findings advance our understanding of the OLLC-specific miRNAs, and miRNA-mediated regulatory networks governing human OL differentiation and maturation and provide promising therapeutic targets for future studies aimed at restoring myelin integrity and improving outcomes in demyelinating diseases.",

      "title": "Modeling Individualized Adolescent Mental Health through a Multifactorial Causal Framework to Identify Potential Intervention Strategies",
      "content": "Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of psychopathology. During this time, physiological changes and environmental exposures jointly shape brain development and influence cognitive and personality maturation, collectively heightening vulnerability to mental disorders. However, the complexity of interactions between these factors has hindered a systems-level understanding of mental health and the causal roles of cognition and personality in psychopathology. In this study, we proposed a multifactorial causal framework integrating brain, pubertal, environmental, and behavioral factors to characterize heterogeneity in adolescent mental health trajectories at the individual level. We then investigated latent causal pathways linking cognition and personality to mental health outcomes and identified potential personalized intervention targets. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset (N = 4,501), we analyzed 165 behavioral pairs connecting cognition and personality traits to mental health symptoms. Using cross-sectional multivariate mediation and longitudinal interaction-inclusive analyses, we identified 68 behavioral pairs showing significant causal relationships, with brain and environmental exposures contributing to most pathways, while pubertal factors exhibited limited involvement. Individualized interpretive analyses further revealed 23 pairs suggesting potential interventions with response rates exceeding 50%. Among these, behavioral inhibition, negative urgency, and processing speed emerged as the most common intervention targets, whereas psychosis symptoms and attention problems were the most likely issues to improve. Overall, our study advances a comprehensive framework capturing the multifactorial and heterogeneous nature of adolescent mental health, delineates specific causal pathways from cognitive and personality traits to psychopathology, and provides a principled basis for potential individualized intervention strategies.",
