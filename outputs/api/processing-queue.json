      "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
      "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

      "title": "Deep Learning-Based Saturation Compensation for High Dynamic Range Multispectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging",
      "content": "In multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm), achieving consistent imaging quality across all spectral channels is crucial for accurately identifying a wide range of fluorophores. However, these essential measurements are frequently compromised by saturation artifacts due to the inherently limited dynamic range of detection systems. To address this issue, we present SatCompFLImNet, a deep learning-based network specifically designed to correct saturation artifacts in multispectral FLIm, facilitating high dynamic range applications. Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements. By enabling reliable fluorescence lifetime measurements under a variety of saturation conditions, SatCompFLImNet paves the way for improved diagnostic tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes, making it a pivotal advancement for research and clinical diagnostics in tissue characterization and disease pathogenesis.",

      "content": "This study investigates a novel approach for analyzing Sit-to-Stand (STS) movements using millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar technology, aiming to develop a non-contact, privacy-preserving, and all-day operational solution for healthcare applications. A 60 GHz mmWave radar system was employed to collect radar point cloud data from 45 participants performing STS motions. Using a deep learning-based pose estimation model and Inverse Kinematics (IK), we calculated joint angles, segmented STS motions, and extracted clinically relevant features for fall risk assessment. The extracted features were compared with those obtained from Kinect and wearable sensors. While Kinect provided a reference for motion capture, we acknowledge its limitations compared to the gold-standard VICON system, which is planned for future validation. The results demonstrated that mmWave radar effectively captures general motion patterns and large joint movements (e.g., trunk), though challenges remain for more fine-grained motion analysis. This study highlights the unique advantages and limitations of mmWave radar and other sensors, emphasizing the potential of integrated sensor technologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of motion analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Future work will expand the scope to more complex movements and incorporate high-precision motion capture systems to further validate the findings.",

      "title": "Ventral Tegmental Area Dopamine Neural Activity Switches Simultaneously with Rule Representations in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus",
      "content": "<p>Multiple brain regions need to coordinate activity to support cognitive flexibility and behavioral adaptation. Neural activity in both the hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is known to represent the spatial context and is sensitive to reward and rule alterations. Midbrain dopamine (DA) activity is key to reward-seeking behavior and learning. There is abundant evidence that midbrain DA modulates HPC and PFC activity. However, it remains underexplored how these networks engage dynamically and coordinate temporally when animals adjust their behavior according to changing reward contingencies. In particular, is there any relationship between DA reward prediction change during rule switching and rule representation changes in mPFC and CA1? We addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of neuronal population activity from the hippocampal area CA1, mPFC, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in male TH-Cre rats performing two spatial working memory tasks with frequent rule switches in blocks of trials. CA1 and mPFC ensembles showed rule-specific activity both during maze running and at reward locations, with mPFC rule coding more consistent across animals compared with CA1. Optogenetically tagged VTA DA neuron firing activity responded to and predicted reward outcome. We found that the correct prediction in DA emerged gradually over trials after rule switching in coordination with transitions in mPFC and CA1 ensemble representations of the current rule after a rule switch, followed by behavioral adaptation to the correct rule sequence. Therefore, our study demonstrates a crucial temporal coordination between the rule representation in mPFC/CA1, the dopamine reward signal, and behavioral strategy.</p>",

      "title": "ACC Reward Location Information Is Carried by Hippocampal Theta Synchrony and Suppressed in a Type 2 Diabetes Model",
      "content": "<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for higher-order cognitive functions, emotional responses, and monitoring internal states. ACC dysfunction has been implicated in an array of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders which have a bidirectional relationship with the metabolic disorder Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances. To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task. We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (<i>n</i> = 5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets. Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (<i>n</i> = 3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location. Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding, and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward location representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits, a reduced post-reinforcement pause, and a differential change in spatial coding properties.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule and ventral striatum (VC/VS) is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder (trOCD). DBS initiation often produces acute improvements in mood and energy. These acute behavioral changes, which we refer to as \"approach behaviors,\" include increased social engagement and talkativeness. We investigated the relationship between stimulation amplitude, spectral power in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and speech rate in one male patient with trOCD implanted with bilateral VC/VS DBS leads and subdural electrodes adjacent to the orbitofrontal cortex and vlPFC. Several times over the first 24&nbsp;weeks of therapy, we conducted experiments where we recorded data during epochs of high-amplitude or zero-/low-amplitude stimulation. We found that both the speech rate and vlPFC power in a high beta frequency band (31 &plusmn; 1.5&nbsp;Hz, 1/<i>f</i> activity removed) increased during high-amplitude as compared with low-amplitude periods. The speech rate correlated with vlPFC high beta power. These effects were more consistent across time points in the left hemisphere than the right. At Week 24, we performed an experiment where stimulation was held constant, while the patient was asked to speak or remain silent. We showed that the presence or absence of speech was not sufficient to increase the vlPFC high beta power, suggesting stimulation is a key driver of the observed neurobehavioral phenomenon. Our results suggest vlPFC high beta power is a biomarker for approach behaviors associated with VC/VS DBS.</p>",

      "title": "Enhancing Human Navigation Ability Using Force-Feedback From a Lower-Limb Exoskeleton",
      "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

      "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Optimization of Perceived Realism of Multi-Modal Haptic Rendering Under Conflicting Sensory Cues",
      "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

      "content": "The growing need for human-machine interfaces (HMIs) underscores the importance of sensory feedback, with electrical stimulation offering efficient interaction in various applications. While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",
