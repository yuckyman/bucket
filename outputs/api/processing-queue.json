      "title": "Glucodynamic Network Transitions of the Human Brain",
      "content": "Variability in neuronal firing patterns enables the brain to flexibly transition between network states, a hallmark of adaptive information processing. Yet the energetic basis of this flexibility remains unknown. Here, we report that the capacity of the brain to shift between network states is contingent on the moment-to-moment variability of glucose metabolism. Using simultaneous resting-state functional FDG-PET and BOLD fMRI in 78 healthy adults (20 to 86 years), we quantified brain metabolic and haemodynamic variability, complexity, and dynamic network connectivity. Individuals with greater variability and complexity of glucose metabolism demonstrated a broader repertoire of network states, marked by globally connected and influential central hubs. Individuals who achieved a broader range of network states had better cognitive performance. In older adults, widespread reductions in dynamic metabolic connectivity were observed. Glucodynamic parameters predicted age and cognitive performance more robustly than haemodynamic measures. These findings reveal that functional network dynamics are emergent properties of the brain's metabolic architecture and that the organisation of large-scale neural circuits is constrained by energetic principles. This understanding may provide critical new insights into the metabolic basis of brain ageing, neurodegeneration and psychiatric conditions.",

      "title": "A Multimodal Framework for Understanding Perceptual Segmentation of Natural Scenes In Autism",
      "content": "Understanding how individuals segment complex natural scenes into perceptual segments is essential for explaining both typical and atypical sensory processing. In Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), differences in visual segmentation and integration are widely documented. However, existing paradigms often rely on simplified stimuli and do not capture the dynamic, naturalistic processes underlying real world scene segmentation. To overcome those limitations, in this work we present a novel, multimodal experimental framework. The framework combines precisely timed, trial-based perceptual measurements with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how neural activity aligns temporally with segmentation decisions and with eye-tracking to examine visual exploration strategies and attention allocation. Neurotypical (NT) participants and participants with ASD aged 16 years and above viewed natural scenes and textures and indicated whether two cued image regions belonged to the same or different perceptual segments. Responses to multiple pairs of cues enabled the estimation of subjectively perceived segmentation maps and the associated uncertainty. Across NT and ASD populations, we analyzed segmentation maps, reaction time distributions, gaze profiles, and trial-aligned neural responses. Behavioral results revealed slower and more idiosyncratic segmentation patterns in ASD. Eye-tracking analyses also demonstrated distinct gaze patterns suggesting broader exploration of the images during early viewing. EEG analyses demonstrated delayed & more diffuse occipital activation in ASD, accompanied by reduced global field power at several key time windows spanning stimulus presentation. Together, these findings establish a reproducible method for studying the temporal and spatial components of natural scene segmentation and indicate meaningful behavioral and neural distinctions in ASD. This framework provides a methodological bridge between controlled experimental stimuli and real-world perception in both neurotypical and neurodivergent populations.",

      "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

      "title": "Gender perception of pareidolia faces in emergency department patients: the influence of physician gender",
      "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "Altered Frontoparietal, Temporal and Sensorimotor Structure-Function Coupling and Its Genetic Underpinnings in Bipolar Disorder",
      "content": "Background: Structure-function coupling quantifies how strongly structural connectivity supports functional communication across brain regions. Investigating structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder, a condition marked by dysconnectivity, may elucidate underlying neural mechanisms. We examined regional structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder and its genetic underpinnings to characterize network-level disruptions. Methods: Regional structure-function coupling was estimated in UK Biobank participants using edge-wise regression between measures of structural connectivity and functional connectivity. Bipolar disorder (n=163) and controls (n=326) were age and sex-matched and compared using general linear models. To explore the genetic basis of these structure-function coupling alterations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in an independent UK Biobank sample (n=38,190) for regions showing significant group differences. Results: Structure-function coupling demonstrated a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient with highest coupling evident in visual regions (R^2=0.29) and lowest in the insula (R^2=0.03). The Bipolar disorder group showed higher structure-function coupling in the temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus (beta=0.269; beta=0.211) and lower coupling in the supramarginal, precentral, and postcentral gyri and the frontal pole (beta=-0.206 to -0.275). GWAS identified seven significant loci, with mapped genes (e.g., KAT6B, INPP5A, PLCE1) involved in neuronal development and cellular signaling. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder showed altered structure-function coupling across regions implicating multiple networks. These alterations suggest stronger structure-function alignment in limbic and attention networks and weaker alignment in sensorimotor, executive, frontoparietal, and salience regions relative to controls, potentially disrupting flexible polysynaptic communication. Altered coupling may relate to genetic variation affecting neurodevelopment, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings offer novel insight into the architectural contributions to the pathophysiology underlying bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow enables axon and dendrite development and maintenance",
      "content": "Distinct microtubule arrays form in axons and dendrites defining their functions in neurons. These arrays are thought to develop through separate processes. Here we challenge this view by showing that axons and dendrites develop by a unifying process: slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow (MT-RF), a recently discovered mechanism of microtubule dynamics. By integrating quantitative data of microtubule dynamics and distributions into a newly developed biophysical model of microtubules across developmental stages, we uncover that MT-RF interacts with microtubule stability and nucleation. Without MT-RF slowdown, this interaction suppresses development and maintenance of axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays. In axons, MT-RF slowdown enables microtubules to reach the tip, even at long distances, supporting axon growth. In dendrites, late MT-RF slowdown facilitates an efficient increase in stable microtubules. Thus, our data-integrated model reveals MT-RF slowdown as central for the development of distinct neuronal compartments, providing a unifying mechanism for microtubule-related physiology.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",
