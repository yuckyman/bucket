      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "title": "Plasmalogen-Independent Neuroprotection: Synthetic alkyl ether lipids activate signaling to mitigate neuroinflammation and enhance cognitive function",
      "content": "Neuroinflammation is a key driver of neurodegenerative disorders, with chronic activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway contributing to neuronal dysfunction and disease progression. In this study, we report that KIT-8, a synthetic alkyl ether lipid, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects despite its inability to be converted into plasmalogens within cells unlike its analog KIT-13, which is known to generate plasmalogens. Remarkably, KIT-8 activates key intracellular signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, and enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf') expression in Neuro2A cells, thereby mimicking the actions of both KIT-13 and natural plasmalogens. Furthermore, KIT-8 significantly improves memory function in mice, underscoring its inherent therapeutic potential. Importantly, the biological activity of KIT-8 suggests that plasmalogen synthesis is not required for its functional effects, introducing a novel concept in ether lipid biology. Supporting this notion, we identified additional alkyl ether lipid analogs, KIT-19 and KIT-20, which also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties despite lacking the ability to generate plasmalogens. These findings indicate that the ether bond structure alone may be sufficient to confer biological activity. To explore this further, we designed and synthesized a series of structurally distinct alkyl ether lipids (KIT compounds) retaining an ether bond at the sn-2 position. In an LPS-induced inflammatory model using mouse-derived microglial MG6 cells, selected compounds KIT-8, KIT-19, and KIT-20 significantly suppressed NF-{kappa}B signaling, reduced p65 nuclear translocation, and downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta} and NOS2. Given the cognitive benefits associated with plasmalogens in Alzheimer's disease, our findings position alkyl ether lipids as promising standalone bioactive molecules, capable of mitigating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuronal function independently of plasmalogen synthesis.",

      "title": "Automated assessment of tDCS electrode placement accuracy based on structural MRI",
      "content": "Purpose: Accurate electrode placement is essential for studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) since it determines whether - and to which extent - the intended brain region was modulated. Precise electrode placement also reduces between-subject variability. Using in-scanner tDCS, accuracy and precision of electrode placement can be determined. Previous studies manually segmented electrode positions from structural MRI, a process that is time-consuming and prone to error. We therefore developed an algorithm that automatedly extracts electrode coordinates from structural MRI. Methods: We applied this algorithm to 49 datasets acquired at different field strengths (3 T and 7 T), with two image resolutions and electrode montages (bifrontal or ring-shaped) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We validated its accuracy by comparing the automatedly extracted coordinates with manual annotations from two independent readers. We then used the actual and intended electrode coordinates to simulate how electrode placement deviations influenced the resulting electric field. Results: For all setups and scanners, the median localization error of the algorithm was 2.3 mm. It was within 1 mm of the variability between human readers (2.7 mm), indicating human-level reliability. Large deviations (> 20 mm) from intended positions led to substantial changes in the electric field - up to 35% for the ring-shaped montage - highlighting the need for placement verification in tDCS studies. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm obviates the need for manual electrode segmentation and allows an objective evaluation of electrode placement accuracy and precision for in-scanner tDCS. It may be used to relate electrode position errors to stimulation effects, thereby supporting reproducible tDCS research.",

      "title": "The circadian clock regulates scavenging of fluid-borne substrates by brain border-associated macrophages",
      "content": "Circadian disruptions perturb the brain and immune system and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD), yet whether this involves dysregulation of brain immunity remains less clear. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the brain immune compartment around the day-night cycle and identify brain border-associated macrophages (BAMs) as highly rhythmic cells. During the rest phase, we find that BAMs exhibit coordinated upregulation of endocytic genes and enhanced uptake of extracellular fluid-borne material including amyloid-beta. Rhythmicity in BAM scavenging is regulated by the clock gene Bmal1, mediated by the endocytic receptor CD206, and perturbed with age. In a mouse model of AD, we show that deletion of Bmal1 in BAMs worsens perivascular and leptomeningeal amyloid-beta plaque burden. Our results identify endocytosis as a specialized and rhythmic BAM function and identify perturbed timing of brain border immune functions as a potential mechanism by which circadian disruptions precipitate amyloidosis.",

      "title": "Systematic Errors in DC Offset Measurement and Mitigation at Neurostimulation Electrodes: Causes, Implications and Solutions",
      "content": "Objective: Neuromodulation therapies are becoming increasingly common as a therapeutic strategy to treat neurological disorders and deficits. Despite their widespread use, the frameworks used to evaluate device longevity and electrochemical safety are limited, producing variable results for platinum (Pt) electrodes across studies. In addition, next-generation neuromodulation electrodes like thin-film microelectrode arrays (TFMEAs) are more prone to failure by virtue of their smaller size, higher edge to bulk ratios, and greater sensitivity to electrochemical dissolution processes. Two potential contributors to the variability in reported electrochemical safety limits and device performance are particularly sensitive to scaling electrodes to smaller geometries, namely: 1) insufficient measurement device input impedance and 2) unmitigated stimulator leakage currents. Approach: To explore these effects, we first characterize the impact of electrode size (1.27 x 10-4 to 7.85 x 10-3 cm2) on apparent open circuit potential (VaOCP) and interpulse potential (VIPP) measurements at platinum electrodes across measurement instrumentation configurations. Next, we evaluated the effectiveness of commonly used DC mitigation strategies, including stimulation with capacitive coupling (CC), and with capacitive coupling combined with cathode/anode shorting after each pulse (CC+ES), as a function of electrode size. Main Results: Without proper DC mitigation, insufficient measurement input impedance leads to an underestimation of DC offsets ({Delta}VIPP) and, consequently, overestimation of charge injection limit (Qinj) at Pt electrodes. In contrast, when DC offsets are properly mitigated and the input impedance of the measurement device is sufficient, the experimentally derived charge injection limits for Pt electrodes are larger than what has been reported historically. Significance: By identifying the instrumentation-related confounds biasing measurements of electrochemical safety limits, this work provides a more consistent basis for the assessment of Qinj for safety, as well as a framework for identifying and mitigating DC offset as a potential source of variability in electrophysiological findings across studies using TFMEAs.",

      "title": "mkvDB - A tiny key-value store wrapper around MongoDB",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p><a href=\"https://patx.github.io/mkvdb\">mkvDB</a> is a unified sync + async key-value store backed by PyMongo that provides a dead-simple and super tiny Redis-like API (<code>set</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>remove</code>, etc). MongoDB handles concurrency so mkvDB is inherently safe across threads, processes, and ASGI workers.</p> <p>A long time ago I wrote a key-value store called pickleDB. Since its creation it has seen many changes in API and backend. Originally it used <code>pickle</code> to store things, had about 50 API methods, and was really crappy. Fast forward it is heavily simplified relies on <code>orjson</code>. It has great performance for single process/single threaded applications that run on a persistent file system. Well news flash to anyone living under a rock, most modern real world scenarios are NOT single threaded and use multiple worker processes. pickleDB and its limitations with a single file writer would never actually be suitable for this. Since most of my time is spent working with ASGI servers and frameworks (namely my own, <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/micropie\">MicroPie</a>, I wanted to create something with the same API pickleDB uses, but safe for ASGI. So mkvDB (MongoKeyValueDataBase) was born. Essentially its a very tiny API wrapper around PyMongo. It has some tricks (scary dark magic) up its sleave to provide a consistent API across sync and async applications.</p> <p>```</p> <h1>Sync context</h1> <p>db = Mkv(&quot;mongodb://localhost:27017&quot;) db.set(&quot;x&quot;, 1) # OK value = db.get(&quot;x&quot;) # OK</p> <h1>Async context</h1> <p>async def foo(): db = Mkv(&quot;mongodb://localhost:27017&quot;) await db.set(&quot;x&quot;, 1) # must await value = await db.get(&quot;x&quot;) ```</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>mkvDB was made for lazy people. If you already know MongoDB you definitely do not need this wrapper. But if you know MongoDB are lazy like me and need to spin up a couple different micro apps weekly (that DO NOT need a complex product relational schema) then this API is super convenient. I don't know if ANYONE actually needs this, but I like the tiny API, and I'd assume a beginner would too (idk)? If PyMongo is already part of your stack, you can use mkvDB as a side car, not the main engine.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>Nothing really directly competes with mkvDB (most likely for good reason lol). The API is based on <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/pickledb\">pickleDB</a>. <a href=\"https://dataset.readthedocs.io/\">DataSet</a> is also <em>sort</em> of like mkvDB but for SQL not Mongo.</p> <h3>Links and Other Stuff</h3> <p>Some useful links:</p> <ul> <li>Homepage: <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/mkvdb\">https://patx.github.io/mkvdb</a></li> <li>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mkvdb/\">https://pypi.org/project/mkvdb/</a></li> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/mkvdb\">https://github.com/patx/mkvdb</a></li> </ul> <p>Reporting Issues</p> <ul> <li>Please report any issues, bugs, or glaring mistakes I made on the Github issues page.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable_Ear3789\"> /u/Miserable_Ear3789 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pk11us/mkvdb_a_tiny_keyvalue_store_wrapper_around_mongodb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pk11us/mkvdb_a_tiny_keyvalue_store_wrapper_around_mongodb/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "The Oneiric Circle and the Misioneros del Temporal in Morelos, Mexico.",
      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",
