      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "content": "High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)-based gesture recognition serves as a critical interface for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, recognition accuracy exhibits a significant dependency on gesture complexity and electrode positioning. To address this, we systematically investigated the relationship between gesture types and sEMG electrode placement locations through intra-subject, inter-day, and inter-subject validation protocols. Two distinct gesture categories were analyzed, i.e., single-degree-of-freedom (single-DoF) gestures and daily-used multi-finger synergistic gestures. Using an open-access gesture dataset, HD-sEMG signals were acquired from three forearm regions: the distal wrist, mid-forearm, and proximal elbow, separately. Classification results using support vector machine (SVM) revealed that single-DoF gestures achieved peak accuracy with distal wrist signals (98.63% for intra-subject, 79.73% for inter-day, and 75.47% for inter-subject validation protocols), whereas daily-used gestures performed optimally with signals from the mid-forearm and proximal elbow regions. These findings demonstrate the specific relationship between electrode placement and gesture type, providing valuable insights for EMG-HCI design and sensor placement strategies based on the nature of the target gesture.",

      "title": "Show HN: Krowdovi \u2013 Video-based indoor navigation on a DePIN creator economy",
      "content": "<p>What is this?<p>Krowdovi is an open-source platform that lets anyone with a smartphone record first-person navigation videos of indoor spaces - hospitals, airports, malls, universities - and earn tokens for helping others find their way around. It's built on Solana using a burn-and-mint DePIN model.The project addresses two problems:<p>Indoor navigation is still broken. 30% of first-time hospital visitors get lost or arrive late to appointments, costing large hospitals $200K-$500K annually in staff time. Existing solutions like Google Live View require pre-captured Street View data (which barely exists indoors), and enterprise tools charge $10K-$50K/year per venue.<p>Videographers are losing work to generative AI. Tools like Sora can generate synthetic video, but they can't walk through your hospital's actual layout or film your venue's real routes. There's an economic opportunity for creators to own location-based visual content that AI can't replicate.<p>How it works<p>For users: Scan a QR code at a venue entrance, watch a first-person video showing the route from where you are to your destination, with overlay graphics and multi-language support.<p>For creators: Record navigation videos on your phone, upload to the platform, earn reputation tiers (Bronze \u2192 Diamond) based on quality and views, get paid when users burn $FIND tokens to unlock your routes.<p>Token mechanics: Users burn $FIND tokens to mint \"credits\" that unlock videos. 75% of burned tokens are permanently removed from circulation, 25% goes to a remint pool that rewards creators. The smart contract on Solana handles burn-and-mint logic, reputation tracking, and distribution.<p>Everything is MIT licensed - fork it, the code is yours.<p>Why I built this<p>I care deeply about making the world accessible for all. If this gets forked someone executes fantastically to make the world a more accessible place for people who have visual or mobility impairments - sweet!<p>Technical stack<p>Smart Contracts: Rust/Anchor on Solana (burn-and-mint engine, reputation tiers, treasury management)\nBackend: Node.js/Express + Prisma/PostgreSQL (venue metadata, video uploads, JWT auth)<p>Frontend: Next.js 14 (Creator Studio, overlay tooling, wallet integration via @solana/wallet-adapter-react)<p>Designed to be hostable on Railway/Vercel with minimal devops. \nThe smart contract is on devnet - needs a security audit before mainnet, but you can test token burns/mints now.<p>Current limitations<p>What works: Smart contract deployed on devnet, full-stack app ready to deploy, video upload workflow, wallet authentication.<p>What doesn't: No real content yet (I need to film 10-20 venues), no mainnet token launch (waiting on security audit + demand validation), quality verification is manual, no mobile app (web-only).<p>Next steps: Deep soulful reflection on anti-gaming, moderation, ZK proofs<p>Try it yourself!<p>GitHub repo has setup instructions. You'll need Solana CLI, Node.js + pnpm, and a Solana wallet for devnet testing.Interested in forking for a different vertical, contributing code, testing by filming routes, or discussing token economics? I'm around to discuss in the comments.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46484882\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46484882</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "Effectiveness of a teletherapy-based phonological short-term memory training in reducing phonological impairments in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia: a multiple case study",
      "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",
