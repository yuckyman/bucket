      "content": "Are there individuals who resist episodic memory decline into older age? Analyzing 728,000 memory tests from 80,000 participants with at least 4 assessments, we introduce a simulation-calibrated framework to identify genuine memory stability. Across cohorts and models, ~10% of adults [&ge;]70 years showed stable performance over a decade. In an MRI subgroup (n{approx}2,000), stable performers exhibited lower rates of brain atrophy across widespread regions, anchoring cognitive stability in structural brain maintenance. However, stability was often transient rather than trait-like: many individuals followed trajectories with extended plateaus of stable performance punctuated by episodes of accelerated decline. Accordingly, 54% showed at least one period of observed stability, averaging 10 years, whereas only 0.4% upheld stable performance over 24 years under the strictest definition. These findings are consistent with a complex-systems model of cognitive aging in which decline often reflects critical transitions rather than continuous erosion.",

      "title": "Opposite Effects of Alpha Oscillations on Mind-Wandering With Eyes Open and Closed",
      "content": "Spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity underlie mind-wandering, when mental experience sometimes becomes unrelated to what we are currently doing. Mind-wandering research has investigated ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha frequency band (7-14 Hz), thought to reflect changes in arousal and attention. However, studies disagree whether alpha power increases or decreases while mind-wandering compared to focused attention. We hypothesized that these opposite effects arise from differences in eye state across studies, as eye closure increases alpha power and can reverse its relationship to sleepiness, which is itself related to mind-wandering. To test this, we recorded EEG while male and female participants with eyes either open or closed were probed to report whether they were focused on the auditory attention task or mind-wandering, as well as how sleepy they were. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that increased alpha power made both mind-wandering and sleepiness reports more likely in the eyes-open group but less likely in the eyes-closed group. A systematic review of past literature largely replicated these opposite relationships across eye states in different paradigms. We propose that these results reflect an inverted-U relationship between alpha power and mind-wandering, formed by a positive relationship at low alpha power values typical of eyes-open states and a negative relationship at high alpha power values typical of eyes-closed states. By sampling alpha power across eye states in the same paradigm, this work reconciles contradictions in prior literature and clarifies how ongoing neural oscillations reflect the stream of mental experiences.",

      "title": "Perspectives of Global Standards on Validation of Blood Pressure Measuring Devices",
      "content": "Blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are essential tools across all areas of medicine, where BP is used as a vital sign for assessing cardiovascular status, guiding clinical decisions in acute medicine, critical care, and routine monitoring of hospitalized patients. International standards for BP measuring devices establish safety and accuracy criteria to ensure the reliability and usability of these instruments. The standardization of BP device validation protocols is vital to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of readings, which are crucial for effective medical decision-making. However, with the rapid advancements in the field of novel cuffless continuous or intermittent blood pressure monitoring devices, traditional validation standards for cuff-based devices are not applicable to cuffless systems. To address this, various organizations have established specific standards tailored for cuffless continuous blood pressure monitoring devices. Nevertheless, only 67 out of over 3,800 studies on the cuffless continuous BP devices (<2%) adopted the appropriate validation criteria, thereby compromising the accuracy and reliability of their reported results. This work presents a comparative analysis of validation protocols for BP measuring devices and provides guidance on the appropriate standards for different types of BP monitors, aims to highlight areas where standards might be strengthened or harmonized. The findings of this research are intended to contribute to the ongoing efforts to establish globally recognized, scientifically rigorous guidelines for the validation of BP measuring devices, fostering innovation and technological advances in this field over time.",

      "title": "Confidence-Driven Deep Learning Framework for Early Detection of Knee Osteoarthritis",
      "content": "Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder that severely impacts mobility and quality of life, particularly among older adults. Its diagnosis often relies on subjective assessments using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, leading to variability in clinical evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a confidence-driven deep learning framework for early KOA detection, focusing on distinguishing KL-0 and KL-2 stages. The Siamese-based framework integrates a novel multi-level feature extraction architecture with a hybrid loss strategy. Specifically, multi-level Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers are employed to extract features from varying network depths, ensuring comprehensive feature representation, while the hybrid loss strategy partitions training samples into high-, medium-, and low-confidence subsets. Tailored loss functions are applied to improve model robustness and effectively handle uncertainty in annotations. Experimental results on the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves competitive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, comparable to those of expert radiologists. Cohen's kappa values ($\\kappa$ $>$ 0.85)) confirm substantial agreement, while McNemar's test ($p$ $>$ 0.05) indicates no statistically significant differences between the model and radiologists. Additionally, Confidence distribution analysis reveals that the model emulates radiologists' decision-making patterns. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed approach to serve as an auxiliary diagnostic tool, enhancing early KOA detection and reducing clinical workload.",

      "title": "Intracortical Brain\u2013Machine Interfaces With High-Performance Neural Decoding Through Efficient Transfer Meta-Learning",
      "content": "Implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) have emerged as a groundbreaking neural technology for restoring motor function and enabling direct neural communication pathways. Despite their therapeutic potential in neurological rehabilitation, the critical challenge of neural decoder calibration persists, particularly in the context of transfer learning. Traditional calibration approaches assume the availability of extensive neural recordings, which is often impractical in clinical settings due to patient fatigue and neural signal variability. Furthermore, the inherent constraints of implanted neural processors\u2014including limited computational capacity and power consumption requirements\u2014demand streamlined processing algorithms. To address these clinical and technical challenges, we developed DMM-WcycleGAN (Dimensionality Reduction Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning based Wasserstein Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks), a novel neural decoding framework that integrates meta-learning principles with optimal transfer learning strategies. This innovative approach enables efficient decoder calibration using minimal neural data while implementing dimensionality reduction techniques to optimize computational efficiency in implanted devices. In vivo experiments with non-human primates demonstrated DMM-WcycleGAN's superior performance in mitigating neural signal distribution shifts between historical and current recordings, achieving a 3% enhancement in neural decoding accuracy using only ten calibration trials while reducing the calibration duration by over 70%, thus significantly improving the clinical viability of iBMI systems.",

      "title": "An Active Spring Mass Model With Biomimetic Ground Reaction Forces for Multiple Terrains",
      "content": "Common activities of daily living naturally blend walking on level ground, stairs, and slopes. Predicting human locomotion behavior across these environments is critical for control design in lower-limb assistive devices. One approach to achieving this goal is to use feedforward simulation of conceptual gait models that capture the whole body dynamics of human locomotion. So far, however, these models have mainly been developed to predict human walking and running dynamics on level ground. Objective: To develop a conceptual gait model that can walk on level ground as well as negotiate stairs and ramps of different inclinations (up to $\\pm 42^\\circ$) while producing biomimetic ground reaction forces (GRFs). Methods: We extended the passive bipedal spring mass model by incorporating active elements, introducing seven control parameters. These parameters were then tuned to match the human GRFs for stairs. Results: By optimizing these control parameters, we found that the resultant model's GRF correlates strongly with human data with median Pearson correlation coefficients $R_{x}>0.89$ and $R_{y}>0.96$ for stair walking. Furthermore, we observe its predictive capabilities are not limited to stairs, as it can also mimic the GRFs of human slope walking. Finally, we conducted a parameter analysis to assess how model parameters affect GRFs and identified a reduced, five parameter model that can reproduce human GRFs with a fidelity similar to the seven parameter model. Significance: The model may help to predict human locomotion behavior in more complex terrain, for instance, when planning foot placements in the interactive control of powered lower-limb exoskeletons and prostheses.",

      "content": "Objective: Harmonic Motion Imaging (HMI) is an ultrasound elasticity imaging method that measures the mechanical properties of tissue using amplitude-modulated acoustic radiation force (AM-ARF). Multi-frequency HMI (MF-HMI) excites tissue at various AM frequencies simultaneously, allowing for image optimization without prior knowledge of inclusion size and stiffness. However, challenges remain in size estimation as inconsistent boundary effects result in different perceived sizes across AM frequencies. Herein, we developed an automated assessment method for tumor and focused ultrasound surgery (FUS) induced lesions using a transformer-based multi-modality neural network, HMINet, and further automated neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) response prediction. HMINet was trained on 380 pairs of MF-HMI and B-mode images of phantoms and in vivo orthotopic breast cancer mice (4T1). Test datasets included phantoms (n = 32), in vivo 4T1 mice (n = 24), breast cancer patients (n = 20), FUS-induced lesions in ex vivo animal tissue and in vivo clinical settings with real-time inference, with average segmentation accuracy (Dice) of 0.91, 0.83, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. HMINet outperformed state-of-the-art models; we also demonstrated the enhanced robustness of the multi-modality strategy over B-mode-only, both quantitatively through Dice scores and in terms of interpretation using saliency analysis. The contribution of AM frequency based on the number of salient pixels showed that the most significant AM frequencies are 800 and 200 Hz across clinical cases. Significance: We developed an automated, multimodality ultrasound-based tumor and FUS lesion assessment method, which facilitates the clinical translation of stiffness-based breast cancer treatment response prediction and real-time image-guided FUS therapy.",

      "content": "<p>Author here. This came out of debugging a real Rails app running in a FIPS enabled container.<p>Everything looked correct. OpenSSL 3 with the FIPS provider enabled. Ruby built against it. A simple pg connection worked.<p>The app failed once ActiveRecord was involved. The error came from libpq. It turned out the pg gem had pulled in a prebuilt native dependency that was linked against different crypto. That path was always there. It just was not exercised until ActiveRecord hit it.<p>Forcing a source build fixed the issue because the extension then linked against the OpenSSL in the image.<p>The takeaway is that a FIPS base image does not mean your dependency graph respects the same boundary once native code is involved.<p>Curious how others have seen this play out in Ruby, Python wheels, Go with CGO, or Node native addons.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46726259\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46726259</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",

      "title": "Cryo-EM structure of pro-aggregant P301L/S320F double-mutant tau filaments formed in mouse brains following peripheral AAV delivery",
      "content": "Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau filaments, with disease-specific folds revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we delivered a recombinant human tau carrying the P301L/S320F double mutation into AppNL-G-F/MAPT double knock-in mice using a blood-brain-barrier-permeable AAV (AAV-PHP.eB), enabling rapid induction of tau aggregation in vivo. The mutant tau was systemically administered via retro-orbital injection, providing a minimally invasive approach for widespread neuronal transduction. Phosphorylated tau aggregation, as well as seeding activity, were observed without the need for exogenous seeds. Our cryo-EM analysis resolved a novel filament fold incorporating residues 279-329, in which the P301L and S320F mutations introduced stabilizing interactions that reinforced filament assembly. This conformation was distinct from previously reported folds, including Alzheimer and Pick tau filaments. Moreover, the filaments adopted a more compact architecture than those observed in patient-derived samples or other model mice. This finding demonstrates that P301L/S320F double-mutant tau adopts a structurally unique, highly aggregation-prone fold, and that this system provides a rapid platform for modeling tau filament formation.",

      "title": "Time-frequency embedding with contrastive pre-training allows sub-second seizure detection",
      "content": "Rapid and accurate detection of electrographic seizures is critical for both clinical diagnosis and neuroscience research. Although seizure identification is commonly performed in the time domain, analysis in the time-frequency domain provides a more comprehensive representation of seizure characteristics. In this study, we present a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporates a trainable continuous wavelet transform (CWT) layer, enabling adaptive time-frequency feature learning directly from raw EEG. To address common data challenges, we augment the 3D CNN for pre-training with contrastive learning, comparing contrastive predictive coding (CPC) against bidirectional contrastive learning (BiCL). On single-channel and multi-channel data, the standard 3D CNN outperformed both a 2D CNN with pre-computed CWT and a 1D CNN that processes raw signals, achieving >95% accuracy down to 0.5-second segments. Compared to the standard 3D CNN, the 3D CNN with BiCL pre-training showed superior performance in both low-data and class imbalance scenarios. Further experiments involving band-pass filtering and temporal shuffling revealed that classification is driven primarily by low-frequency patterns and statistical features rather than temporal dependencies. The proposed framework also maintained >90% accuracy with moderate noise and downsampling applied to inputs, as well as when cross-subject generalization was evaluated using held-out subjects. We show that a 3D CNN with a trainable CWT layer and BiCL pre-training enables accurate sub-second seizure detection and effectively mitigates data limitations common in clinical settings. This work demonstrates that time-frequency embedding within CNNs, augmented by self-supervised pre-training, offers a promising path toward architectures for sub-second seizure detection in the presence of practical limitations of real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Reduced GABAB receptor activation and post activation depression of proprioceptive afferents after spinal cord injury.",
      "content": "Despite a long history of studying presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferent synapse that produces the monosynaptic EPSP on motoneurons, recent evidence has upset the conventional idea that GABAA receptors mediate this inhibition and instead suggests that there are mainly GABAB receptors at this synapse. However, without targeted access to the GABAergic neurons that activate these receptors, quantifying their functional contribution to presynaptic inhibition has proven difficult. We demonstrate here that focal optogenetic activation of terminals of a subpopulation of GAD2+ GABAergic neurons that exclusively project ventrally to Ia afferent synapses produce long-lasting presynaptic inhibition that is entirely mediated by GABAB receptors and simultaneously produces a characteristic brief GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP on the motoneurons. These ventral GAD2 neurons are recurrently activated by Ia afferents, contributing to post-activation depression with repeated afferent reflex testing, with a similar long time-course to post-activation depression of the H-reflex induced in humans from either repetitive activation of the same Ia afferents or from antagonist nerve conditioning. In contrast, focal activation of dorsally projecting GAD2 neurons does not directly cause presynaptic inhibition or postsynaptic IPSPs but does produce primary afferent depolarization. Following chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), the expression of GABAB receptors on the Ia terminal is halved, and in mice and humans, is associated with a similar decrease of GABAB receptor-mediated post-activation depression of Ia-EPSPs transmission, which is reversed by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. In summary, GABAB receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition, but are down regulated with SCI, contributing to reflex hyperexcitability associated with spasticity.",

      "title": "Microstate Dynamics of Focused Attention Meditation",
      "content": "Focused-attention meditation provides a tractable model for examining how large-scale brain dynamics support attention and self-regulation. Using high-density EEG microstate analysis, we investigated how focused-attention meditation on the breath (Anapanasati) modulates intrinsic brain activity in 22 experienced practitioners, compared with baseline rest and deliberate mental imagery. Five canonical microstate classes (A-E) were identified. Meditation produced a robust reduction of Microstate C across coverage, duration, and occurrence, accompanied by increased presence of Microstates D and E (all Microstate x Condition interactions p < 0.0001). Source localization revealed that Microstate C was generated primarily in medial and lateral temporal regions including the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, whereas Microstate D involved posterior midline regions including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and Microstate E engaged frontoparietal and orbitolimbic networks. Together, these results indicate that focused-attention meditation reorganizes the temporal architecture of large-scale brain dynamics by downregulating microstate patterns associated with self-referential and memory-based processing while enhancing neural states supporting attentional stability and internal monitoring.",
