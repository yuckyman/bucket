      "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
      "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

      "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

      "title": "Closed-Loop Manual Control With Tactile or Visual Feedback Under Wireless Link Impairments",
      "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

      "title": "Measurement of Airborne Ultrasound Focus on Skin Surface Using Thermal Imaging",
      "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

      "title": "TexSenseGAN: A User-Guided System for Optimizing Texture-Related Vibrotactile Feedback Using Generative Adversarial Network",
      "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

      "title": "Neural responses to binocular in-phase and anti-phase stimuli",
      "content": "Binocular vision fuses similar inputs from the two eyes into a single percept, whereas incompatible inputs can produce rivalry, lustre, or diplopia. We measured neural responses to binocular stimuli with different phase relationships to test predictions from contemporary binocular combination models. Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded from 15 observers in response to monocular and binocular stimulation at 3 Hz, using either On/Off or counterphase flicker with varied spatial and temporal phase relationships. On/Off and counterphase flicker elicited responses at the expected fundamental frequency (3 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively) and their harmonics. Manipulating phase relationships modulated these response patterns, including a reduction in the fundamental amplitude for On/Off flicker. The data were modeled with a series of binocular combination algorithms, ranging in complexity from a simple linear sum to a two-stage binocular gain-control model with parallel monocular and binocular phase-selective channels. The model required parallel monocular channels to account for our data, whereas phase selectivity was not essential. Overall, the two-stage contrast gain-control model remains a powerful and flexible framework for describing binocular combinations across various experimental conditions and modalities.",

      "title": "Camera Seismocardiogram Based Monitoring of Left Ventricular Ejection Time",
      "content": "Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), reflecting the duration from the onset to the end of blood ejection by the left ventricle during each heartbeat, is a critical parameter for measuring cardiac pumping efficiency. Continuous and regular monitoring of LVET is particularly crucial in assessing cardiac health, valvular function, and myocardial contractility. Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can be utilized for LVET monitoring, as the temporal distance between the aortic valve opening (AO) and aortic valve closure (AC) in SCG signals can accurately depict LVET. This study proposes a novel way to extract LVET from laser speckle videos recorded by a remote camera based on the principle of defocused speckle imaging, thereby enabling non-contact monitoring of LVET. We extract both the low-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-LF), regarded as SCG signals, and the high-frequency components of laser speckle motion (LSM-HF) from recorded videos. We utilize LSM-HF to assist the detection of AO and AC markers in LSM-LF. We validated the effectiveness of our AO and AC detection algorithm on a self-made dataset comprising 21 participants with 9616 SCG cycles. The benchmark shows that the detection accuracy for AO and AC reached 98.16% and 97.94%, respectively, with an mean absolute error of 0.5571 ms for LVET estimation. The results demonstrate that camera-SCG has strong potential for cardiac health monitoring.",

      "title": "Biophysical Modeling of Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering",
      "content": "The increasing demand for wearables necessitates efficient energy harvesting and wireless power transfer solutions. Capacitive Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Powering (EQS-HBP) is a promising technology for wirelessly powering on-body devices, offering enhanced received power ($P_{rx}$) with full-body coverage. Unlike EQS Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which optimizes channel capacity, EQS-HBP focuses on maximizing ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, requiring a distinct biophysical model tailored to lower termination impedance ranges where ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ peaks. This paper presents comprehensive simulations\u2014finite element method (FEM), distributed circuit modeling\u2014and in-vivo experiments to characterize the body channel as a finite impedance wire, with impedance determined by body dimensions. Contact impedance between the body and receiver, inversely related to contact area, significantly affects ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, necessitating careful design for devices with small contact areas. Furthermore, the body cross-sectional area influences voltage recovery after the point of load, with smaller cross-sections yielding reduced recovery. A lumped circuit model is developed to encapsulate these findings with circuit techniques to maximize ${\\rm P_{rx}}$, demonstrating that series resonance in a ground-floated receiver reduces input impedance by over 65x and improves ${\\rm P_{rx}}$ by more than 25\u00d7 over parallel resonance. We also propose a method to approximate optimal loading impedance for various receiver configurations and analyze the impact of inductor Q factor. We prove that neither series nor parallel resonance can mitigate the transmitter return path capacitance. These insights enable the development of a much higher on-body wireless power transfer method, advancing wearable device technology for applications in healthcare, fitness, and beyond.",
