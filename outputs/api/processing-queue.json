      "content": "Community detection is a crucial task in network research, applicable to social systems, biology, cybersecurity, and knowledge graphs. Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited significant representational capability; yet, they frequently experience instability and erroneous clustering, often referred to as \u201dhallucinations.\u201d These artifacts stem from sensitivity to high-frequency eigenmodes, over-parameterization, and noise amplification, undermining the robustness of learned communities. To mitigate these constraints, we present F2-CommNet, a Fourier\u2013Fractional neural framework that incorporates fractional-order dynamics, spectrum filtering, and Lyapunov-based stability analysis. The fractional operator implements long-memory dampening that mitigates oscillations, whereas Fourier spectral projections selectively attenuate eigenmodes susceptible to hallucination. Theoretical analysis delineates certain stability criteria under Lipschitz non-linearities and constrained disturbances, resulting in a demonstrable expansion of the Lyapunov margin. Experimental validation on synthetic and actual networks indicates that F2-CommNet reliably diminishes hallucination indices, enhances stability margins, and produces interpretable communities in comparison to integer-order GNN baselines. This study integrates fractional calculus, spectral graph theory, and neural network dynamics, providing a systematic method for hallucination-resistant community discovery.",

      "title": "Towards robust probabilistic maps in Deep Brain Stimulation: exploring the impact of patient number, stimulation counts, and statistical approaches",
      "content": "IntroductionProbabilistic Stimulation Maps (PSMs) are increasingly employed to identify brain regions associated with optimal therapeutic outcomes in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). However, their reliability and generalizability are challenged by the limited size of most patient cohorts and the inherent variability introduced by different statistical methods and input data configurations. This study aimed to investigate the geometrical variability of Probabilistic Sweet Spots (PSS) as a function of both the number of patients (nPat) and the number of stimulations per patient (nStim), and to model a stability boundary defining the minimum data requirements for obtaining geometrically stable PSS.MethodsThree statistical approaches\u2013Bayesian t-test, Wilcoxon test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction, and Wilcoxon test with nonparametric permutation correction\u2013were applied to two patient cohorts: a primary cohort of 36 patients undergoing DBS for Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD), and a secondary cohort of 61 patients treated for Essential Tremor (ET), used to assess generalizability. Stimulation test data was collected intra-operatively for the first cohort and post-operatively for the second one. Geometric stability was evaluated based on variability in PSS volume extent and centroid location.ResultsThe analysis revealed a non-linear trade-off between nPat and nStim to yield stable PSS. A stability boundary was defined, representing the minimum combinations of nPat\u2013nStim required for anatomically robust PSS. Among the tested methods, the Bayesian t-test achieved stability with smaller sample sizes (\u223c15 patients) and demonstrated a consistent performance across both cohorts. In contrast, the Wilcoxon-based methods showed variable behavior between cohorts, which differed in symptom type and testing phase (intra-operative testing vs. post-operative screening).DiscussionThe proposed PSS stability boundary provides a practical reference for designing DBS studies and stimulation screening protocols aimed at probabilistic mapping. The Bayesian t-test emerged as a reliable method across both cohorts, supporting its potential in studies with limited sample sizes and scenarios where the method needs to be readily generalized to varying symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of considering both cohort size and stimulation count in probabilistic DBS mapping and call for further investigation into method-specific sensitivities to clinical and procedural factors.",

      "content": "Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a cognitive dysfunction of the brain caused by the tumor itself and antitumor treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and surgery. As a common complication of cancer, CRCI significantly affects patients\u2019 quality of life. In recent years, the neurobiological mechanisms of CRCI have garnered widespread attention. Research indicates that cancer-related therapies lead to CRCI by affecting brain structure, function, metabolism, and blood perfusion. Various neuroimaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and electroencephalography (EEG), have been extensively employed to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of CRCI. This article reviews recent advancements in neuroimaging research on CRCI, focusing on its influencing factors and the neural mechanisms underlying different cognitive domains, and summarizes findings from relevant animal model studies.",

      "content": "Prosthetic knee joints are essential assistive technologies designed to replicate natural gait and improve mobility for individuals with lower-limb loss. This study presents a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of a two-degree-of-freedom prosthetic knee joint and introduces three robust nonlinear control strategies: Integral Sliding Mode Control, Conditional Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control, and Conditional Adaptive Positive Semidefinite Barrier Function-based Sliding Mode Control. These controllers are designed to address the challenges associated with nonlinear joint dynamics, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties during locomotion. To optimize control performance, the gain parameters of each controller were fine-tuned using Red Fox Optimization, a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the intelligent hunting behavior of red foxes. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov theory, and control effectiveness is evaluated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and validated via hardware-in-the-loop testing using a C2000 Delfino F28379D microcontroller. Among the three controllers, the CoBA-based approach demonstrated the highest tracking accuracy, fastest convergence, and smoothest torque profile. The close agreement between simulation and experimental results confirms the practical applicability of the proposed control framework, offering a promising solution for intelligent and adaptive prosthetic knee systems.",

If you're interested\nin seeing all minor changes you can follow our\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/commits/main\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commits Page</a> on GitHub or\n<a href=\"https://redd.it/17f8msf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Updates Channel</a> in Discord.</p>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"wiki-updates\" tabindex=\"-1\">Wiki Updates <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#wiki-updates\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Added the <strong><a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/hx97zL3W/978676.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amoled Theme</a></strong> / <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/fMrnGmF.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> to our site as a <a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/pvkfg3hC/image.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Toggle</a> / <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/qF7exKw.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2</a> that can be turned on or off. Thank you to @Land for doing this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Built a <strong><a href=\"https://fmhy-search.dev.zenir.tech/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">External Search Engine</a></strong> that should work better in most cases than the built in VitePress search on our website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added a <strong><a href=\"https://fmhyclone.pages.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New Backup</a></strong> of FMHY with daily sync, hosted on GitLab. It also has a backup of the <a href=\"https://fmhyapi.wispy.qzz.io/single-page\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">raw markdown</a> page. We also added another <a href=\"https://a-fmhy.pages.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">backup</a> of our website that has the theme on from above on automatically.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Space section has become a bit hard to navigate (60+ lines,) so we've split it into its <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/educational#space\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">own head section</a>, with 2 new subsections: <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/educational#astronomy\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Astronomy</a> and <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/educational#spacecraft\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spacecraft</a>. Astronomy will cover things related to celestial objects or phenomena in the cosmos. Spacecraft will cover things like rockets, launches and the ISS. The head section will be for more general space related things, like NASAs website, news, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remakes / Ports in gaming had over 80 lines, and was pretty disorganized, so we've split it into 3 new sections to make it more comprehensible: <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/gaming#decomps-ports\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Decomps / Ports</a>, <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/gaming#remakes-recreations\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Remakes / Recreations</a> and <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/gaming#revival-projects\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Revival Projects</a>. Also turned Special Interest into its own head category to help organize TOC better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Re-ordered <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/reading#manga\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Manga Sites</a> based on poll results from our Discord. Weeb Central has been moved to #1 spot, and MangaFire + MangaNato have both been starred.

Note that they do expire and must be regenerated sometimes. Guide is listed next to <a href=\"https://fmhy.net/privacy#vpn\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Proton</a>.
