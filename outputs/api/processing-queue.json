      "title": "Retrograde transduction of dopaminergic cells in substantia nigra of rhesus monkey",
      "content": "Neuromodulatory systems regulate neural circuits across broad regions of the brain, and disruption of the dopaminergic system contributes to psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Engineered viral vectors have been used to target the neuromodulatory systems of the nonhuman primate brain (Y. Chen et al., 2023; El-Shamayleh et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2010; Lerchner et al., 2014; Perez et al., 2022). However, a conspicuous obstacle to the isolation and modulation of specific pathways is the inability of many retrogradely infecting viruses to transduce dopaminergic (DA) cells efficiently (Tervo et al., 2016; Cushnie et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2020). We compare the DA neuron retrograde transduction efficacy of four viral vectors after injection into the striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP). Selectivity was assessed by comparing the neuronal co-expression of fluorescent reporter protein and tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) antibody in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). The rabies pseudotyped lentiviral vector, FuG-B2, produced superior retrograde transduction of DA cells to FuG-C or FuG-E. AAV2.retro was the least effective.",

      "title": "A Joint Tau Propagation and Neuroinflammation Model Reinforces Inflammatory Modulation of Network-Driven Spread in Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia. Despite over a century of research, AD remains untreatable due to an incomplete understanding of its underlying mechanisms. While amyloid beta has dominated therapeutic efforts, tau pathology and neuroinflammation represent critical disease drivers and intriguing therapeutic targets. We developed an extended computational model building upon the open-source Aggregation Network Diffusion (AND) framework by coupling spatial tau propagation and aggregation with ordinary differential equations representing key inflammatory cascades. The model incorporates M1/M2 microglia and astrocytic activation, cytokine-mediated feedback loops, and neuronal loss, all modulated via region-specific genetic expression matrices of ApoE and TREM2 with variant-specific weighting. The model maintains biologically plausible tau dynamics while generating robust inflammatory marker trends, serving as a computational testbed for hypothesis generation and mechanistic exploration. The inflammatory components independently capture experimental observations and display a marked M1/M2 microglia divergence. The model demonstrates enhanced similarity to regional tau propagation patterns due to inflammatory and genetic components, reinforcing neuroinflammation's role in tau spread and highlighting the need to incorporate these processes in modeling efforts. Finally, through parsimony analysis, we identify microglia and pro-inflammatory rates (including microglia-facilitated tau spread) as key contributors to improved model accuracy, informing future modeling approaches.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size.

      "title": "Patterns of prefrontal cortical activity associated with attention-demanding and motor aspects of dual-task walking as measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.",
      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.
