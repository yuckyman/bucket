      "title": "A Diachronic Investigation of the Change in Form and Formational-Semantic Systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language Lexicon",
      "content": "It has been argued in previous research that several competing pressures guide the directions of language evolution (economy vs. redundancy; arbitrariness vs. systematicity). For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",

      "content": "High-density tactile sensor arrays that replicate human touch could restore texture perception in paralyzed individuals. However, conventional tactile sensor arrays face inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, sensitivity, and crosstalk suppression due to microstructure size limitations and signal interference. To address this, we developed a tactile sensor featuring 10 \u03bcm-scale pyramid tips that achieve ultra-high sensitivity (8.082 kPa^(-1) in 0.2-0.5 kPa range). By integrating a...",
