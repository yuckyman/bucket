      "content": "Neuropsychological tests are essential tools for evaluating dementia and related neurocognitive disorders, with their clinical utility determined mainly by their validity. This paper critically reviews the diverse evidence supporting the validity of neuropsychological tests in dementia assessment. Criterion validity is discussed in relation to the tests\u2019 ability to predict clinical diagnoses and underlying brain pathology, with a focus on their sensitivity to functional impairments and progressive neuropathological changes. Construct validity is explored through the lens of cognitive processes underlying test performance, using evidence from correlation structures and experimental paradigms. Furthermore, the paper examines the impact of emerging digital technologies on the evaluation of neuropsychological test validity, highlighting contrasts with traditional validation methods. The review identifies discrepancies between different types of validity evidence, emphasizing the need to contextualize validity within specific clinical and research applications. By addressing the conceptual limitations and trade-offs between validation approaches, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for interpreting validity evidence. Ultimately, it offers theoretical and practical implications for enhancing the robustness of neuropsychological tests in clinical practice and research.",

      "title": "Using vision transformers for electrographic seizure classification to aid physician review of intracranial electroencephalography recordings",
      "content": "We introduce a vision transformer (ViT)-based approach for automated electrographic seizure classification using time-frequency spectrogram representations of intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected from patients implanted with the NeuroPace\u00ae RNS\u00ae System. The ViT model was trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on a large-scale dataset of 136,878 iEEG recordings from 113 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, achieving an average test accuracy of 96.8%. Clinical validation was performed on an independent expert-labeled dataset of 3,010 iEEG recordings from 241 patients, where the model achieved 95.8% accuracy and 94.8% F1 score on recordings with unanimous expert agreement, outperforming both ResNet-50 and standard 2D CNN baselines. To evaluate generalizability, the model was tested on a separate out-of-distribution dataset of 136 recordings from 44 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), achieving over 75% accuracy and F1 scores across all expert comparisons. Explainability analysis revealed focused attention on characteristic electrographic seizure patterns within iEEG time-frequency spectrograms during high-confidence seizure predictions, while more diffuse attention was observed in non-seizure classifications, providing insight into the underlying decision process. By enabling reliable electrographic seizure classification, this approach may assist physicians in the manual review of large volumes of iEEG recordings.",

Innovations include frequency-domain feature decoupling, dynamic parameter optimization, and enhanced spatio-temporal feature focusing.ResultsExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.DiscussionExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.",

      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",
