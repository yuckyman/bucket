      "title": "Cerebral responses to famous face recognition as a potential functional biomarker of mild cognitive impairment",
      "content": "BackgroundSocial cognition impairments\u2014including difficulties in recognizing personally familiar faces\u2014occur early in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and can lead to social withdrawal, reduced motivation, and secondary depression. Face recognition is central to social cognition, yet its neural basis in MCI remains insufficiently understood. This study examined whether task-based fMRI during famous face recognition could capture early alterations in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), key nodes supporting semantic access and internally directed cognition within the default mode network (DMN).MethodsThirty-two participants (20 healthy controls, 12 MCI) completed two fMRI tasks: famous vs. non-famous face judgment and face vs. object categorization. A 2 \u00d7 2 factorial analysis assessed Group and Task effects, and small-volume correction was applied to PHG and PCC.ResultsBehavioral accuracy was comparable between groups; however, whole-brain analyses revealed markedly reduced activation in the left PHG and PCC in the MCI group during socially meaningful face processing. ROI analyses further demonstrated that the left PHG reduction remained significant after FWE correction, whereas PCC showed a weaker reduction that did not survive correction for multiple comparisons.ConclusionThese findings suggest early alterations in PHG\u2013PCC networks that precede observable behavioral decline in MCI. In particular, reduced activation in the left PHG may reflect early disruptions in semantic access and internally directed processing. Assessing these socially relevant neural circuits alongside established amyloid and tau biomarkers may provide complementary functional insight into early cognitive vulnerability in individuals at risk for dementia.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of transcranial electrical stimulation combined with dual-task training in stroke, mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson\u2019s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
      "content": "AimIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) combined with dual task training (DTT) on physical and cognitive functions in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and stroke disorders.MethodWe conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for English-language literature on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of tDCS, tACS, or tRNS combined with DTT in adults with MCI, PD, and stroke. The search covered studies from the inception of each database up to November 21, 2025. The initial screening of selected articles was conducted independently by two researchers (YLQ and WLW).ResultsA total of twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising individuals with stroke (n\u202f=\u202f4), MCI (n\u202f=\u202f3), and PD (n\u202f=\u202f5). Meta-analysis revealed that active tDCS+DTT yielded no significant overall improvement in global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): SMD\u202f=\u202f0.09, 95% CI [\u22120.49, 0.66], p =\u202f0.77, I2 =\u202f72%). A large, highly homogeneous benefit was observed for executive function (TMT-B: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.33, 95% CI [\u22122.39, \u22120.27], p =\u202f0.01), driven exclusively by the MCI subgroup (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22122.35, 95% CI [\u22123.20, \u22121.51], I2 =\u202f0%). Timed Up and Go cognitive-motor dual-task (TUG CMDT) cadence improved overall (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.58, 95% CI [0.09, 1.08], p =\u202f0.02, I2 =\u202f39%) in both MCI and stroke subgroups. TUG motor dual task (MDT) speed improved modestly (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.42, 95% CI [0.02, 0.83], p =\u202f0.04, I2 =\u202f34%), and CMDT speed showed a strong trend (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.49, p =\u202f0.09), only significant in stroke (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.42, p =\u202f0.002). However, this generalized finding must be nuanced by specific efficacy observed in individual PD studies, which reported significant gains in force-tremor decoupling, postural stability, and CMDT accuracy.ConclusionThe meta-analysis suggests that the effects of tDCS combined with DTT are remarkable in certain populations and for specific outcomes. While substantial improvements are confirmed for executive function and dual-task gait in MCI and stroke, the overall limited efficacy in PD highlights the critical influence of heterogeneity and intervention specificity. Future research should prioritize disease-specific electrode montages and the integration of tACS or tRNS to optimize outcomes across diverse neurological populations.",
