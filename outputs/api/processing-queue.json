      "title": "Convergent pathways with impaired inhibition at the frontal cortex are the outcome of differential alterations in the male and female schizophrenia model",
      "content": "Schizophrenia is associated with impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and disrupted synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), yet the biological mechanisms underlying these deficits may differ between sexes. Here, we used a double-hit rat model, combining perinatal NMDA receptor blockade and post-weaning social isolation, to dissect sex-specific alterations in inhibitory circuit maturation, synaptic plasticity, and prefrontal function. Male double-hit rats exhibited robust schizophrenia-like behaviors, reduced parvalbumin (PV), OTX2, and perineuronal net (PNN) expression, decreased GAD67 levels, and increased DNA damage in PV interneurons, together indicating impaired inhibitory maturation and weakened plasticity. In contrast, females showed milder behavioral deficits but displayed increased PV and OTX2 intensities, enhanced cFos activation in excitatory neurons, and transcriptomic upregulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and synapse assembly pathways, suggesting a state of heightened or dysregulated plasticity. Despite these divergent molecular trajectories, in vivo electrophysiology revealed a shared functional endpoint in both sexes: a shift from paired-pulse inhibition to facilitation during basolateral amygdala-evoked responses, reflecting impaired GABAB-mediated inhibitory feedback. Pharmacological blockade of GABAB, but not GABAA, receptors reproduced this phenotype, identifying GABAB signaling as a key mechanism underlying cortical disinhibition. Altogether, our findings reveal that males and females reach convergent prefrontal inhibitory deficits through sex-specific molecular pathways, underscoring the importance of sex as a biological variable in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Effects of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis on Bladder Function and Properties of Pelvic Ganglion Neurons",
      "content": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) has substantial impacts on autonomic function. In part, MS results in loss of normal autonomic activity that contributes to disease-associated pathology such as neurogenic bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Yet little is known of the impacts of MS on peripheral autonomic neurons that directly innervate these target organs. In this study, we measured changes in properties of neurons of the mouse major pelvic ganglion (MPG) associated with two different levels of severity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Our data show that bladder function and physiological properties of MPG neurons are altered in association with EAE, and differ between less and more severe clinical scores associated with disease progression. EAE results in decreased bladder function measured by decreased urine output and increased micturition pressures. In the most severely affected animals, action potentials (APs) show increased half-widths as a result of decreased maximum decay slopes leading to overall broader and longer APs and lower maximum firing frequency. These changes in AP properties are associated with differences in ion channel subunit expression as well. KCNA1-4, KCNN3, SCN2A1 and SCN3A mRNA levels in MPGs decreased with disease severity. Taken together, our data indicate that peripheral autonomic neurons are fundamentally altered in EAE, suggesting that longer-term therapeutic approaches for MS could target these neurons directly to potentially help ameliorate neurogenic target organ dysfunction.",

      "title": "Coordination of spike timing among the neurons of the cerebellum",
      "content": "We tend to think of neurons as either excitatory or inhibitory, but certain neurons chemically inhibit their downstream targets while electrically exciting their neighbors. For example, in the cerebellum, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) inhibit Purkinje cells (P-cells) via release of GABA but promote spiking in each other via gap junctions. What is gained by having an inhibitory neuron excite its neighbor? Here, we recorded activities of P-cells and MLIs as marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and found that spike timing in pairs of neighboring neurons of the same type exhibited a mathematical regularity: as firing rates increased, rate of spikes that were within 1ms of each other grew disproportionately while 2-4ms intervals were suppressed. To uncover the purpose of this coordination, during saccades we recorded thousands of neuron triplets in which two MLIs converged onto a single target P-cell. When the MLIs spiked within 1ms of each other, they produced superposition of their individual effects on their target; a deep inhibition followed by a post-inhibitory rebound. However, when the MLIs spiked 2-4ms apart, the two spikes interfered with each other, producing partial cancellation. Thus, electrical coupling between inhibitory neurons orchestrated their spike timing so that as firing rates increased, the temporal intervals that induced downstream superposition were promoted while the intervals that caused interference were suppressed.",

      "title": "Detection and quantification of planar traveling waves in the EEG using spherical phase fitting",
      "content": "Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the spatiotemporal dynamics of oscillatory brain activity. Recordings at various scales have shown oscillations propagating as waves over cortical space, both at small and large scales. The most common waves observed in the EEG are planar waves, formed by a synchronized wavefront propagating in a consistent direction (e.g., posterior-anterior). These waves have been linked to diverse perceptual and cognitive measures. However, their quantification has faced issues due to the inherently noisy EEG signal and its ambiguous spatial localization. Existing methods employ restrictive windows of analysis (e.g., lines of electrodes) or rely on wave motifs extracted from the data. A specific algorithm for detecting planar waves is still lacking. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis pipeline for this purpose, comprising three steps: first, genuine oscillatory activity is extracted from the EEG as clusters. The spatial phase gradient is then fit using a spherical wave model. Finally, stable waves are extracted from the time series of fits. We validate our method using simulations over a physiological range of parameters. Using a forward model, we test EEG wave detection for propagation along different pathways at the source level. Lastly, we apply our analysis to real EEG recordings, targeting alpha oscillations during visual stimulation and at rest. In summary, our method provides a reliable algorithm for detecting planar waves in the EEG. Given the emerging functional roles of traveling waves in perception and cognition, this could potentially be utilized in a wide range of future studies.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "We propose a protocol to detect and track cognitive drift caused by algorithmic curation. We confirm that the protocol is interpretable, sensitive, reproducible, and portable across domains. It is especially suited to cognitive and neurocognitive research. We build a Cognitive Drift Index (CDI), confirm its three dimensions, and use a small calibration run to set reasonable ranges. We then map CDI to governance action bands. Using health short videos as a case, we estimate path effects with a weighted least squares ANOVA and test robustness. The steps lead to the same pattern, which supports the protocol\u2019s design and practical use. We show each component alongside the composite and sort totals into action bands so practitioners and responsible-AI teams can choose proportionate actions. We also consider using the method, as a conceptual tool, with eye-tracking or EEG to enable multimodal validation.",

      "title": "Social isolation: an integrated molecular web that disrupts cellular homeostasis",
      "content": "Social isolation and perceived loneliness are increasingly recognized as serious public health concerns, with extensive evidence linking them to adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Defined, respectively, as the objective lack of social interactions and the subjective feeling of insufficient connection, both conditions are present across various age groups and are associated with elevated risks of cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders. Epidemiological studies have also identified a strong association between chronic social isolation and the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), potentially mediated by dysregulated stress responses, immune function, and endocrine signaling. Animal models of social deprivation have proven instrumental in elucidating the biological underpinnings of these effects, revealing disruptions in neurotransmitter systems and in the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, with important downstream metabolic alterations. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking social isolation to MetS and CVD, with a focus on oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy. A deeper understanding of these pathways is essential to guide the development of targeted interventions and to reduce the long-term health burden associated with social disconnection.",
