      "title": "DfE-DB: A systematic database of 3.8 million human decisions across multiple experience-based tasks",
      "content": "Learning from experience is central to human decision making, yet research on experience-based choice remains fragmented across paradigms and disciplines. We present the Decision-from-Experience Database (DfE-DB), a standardized, openly accessible resource comprising 3.8 million trial-level decisions from 11,921 participants across 168 studies and 13 paradigms. By harmonizing raw behavioral data and classifying studies along 13 key design features, the database enables quantitative comparisons previously obscured by heterogeneous task and data structures. Using this resource, we show that choice tendencies--toward higher risk, expected value, or experienced mean--vary substantially across paradigms and are strongly shaped by core design features such as feedback type, outcome structure, stationarity, and sampling. These features explain substantial cross-study variability and reveal underexplored paradigm variants. DfE-DB provides the empirical infrastructure necessary to test the generality of behavioral phenomena and computational models, fostering a more integrated science of decisions from experience.",

Unlike the Python standard library, third-party packages may introduce their own conventions, dynamic behaviors, and runtime logic that can be difficult to analyze statically.

      "content": "To some extent, humans can re-experience the sensations of past events and pre-experience the future. These capacities are inter-related. But there are substantial individual differences. At the extremes, small minorities of people report that they either cannot have imagined experiences at all, or that their imagined sensations are as real to them as their actual experiences of the physical world. We wanted to know if such individual differences are uniform across different types of imagined experience (e.g. vision, audio, taste and smell), or if people generally have idiosyncratic patterns of different types (vision, audio, taste and smell) of imagined experiences. We find that people report having idiosyncratic diets of different types of imagined sensation, characterised by differences in salience. One person might have more salient imagined visual than taste experiences, while another reports the reverse. Moreover, these propensities are consistent across peoples attempts to re-experience the past, and to pre-experience the future, and they predict peoples experience and usage of different types of imagined sensation in their everyday lives.",

      "title": "An Interactive Brain Atlas of Knowledge",
      "content": "Biomedical knowledge about the brain increases every day, with a rapidly growing number of scientific publications, datasets, and software tools. While this informational plethora is not merely comprehensible by human beings, recent developments in information science and computational linguistics aim to make this knowledge programmatically accessible by literature mining. However, integrating these semantic methods into neuroimaging standards remains insufficient, hindering researchers from unraveling their full potential. Therefore, we developed the semantic meta-analysis platform The Virtual Brain adapter of semantics (TVBase) that projects biomedical knowledge preserved in over 36 million scientific articles onto a 3D standardized brain. The literature-mining platform SCAIView was used to extract ontologically defined biomedical entities and their associations with brain anatomy from the PubMed database. By querying a specific concept, the association strength with each anatomical term was calculated using entropy. To project the data onto a standardized brain, we created a unique transformation matrix that links over 800 anatomical terms to voxel coordinates of a parcellated standard brain. This novel method of knowledge projection extracts region-specific information about biomedical concepts from the literature to support translational multi-scale approaches to computational neuroscience. The multi-purpose software framework TVBase is openly available as a Python library. It aims for hypothesis-free neuroimaging pattern interpretation, hypothesis generation, and applications in personalized medicine.",

      "title": "Projection-specific Routing of Odor Information in the Olfactory Cortex",
      "content": "Sensory processing in the mammalian cortex relies on extensive feedforward and feedback connections, yet how information is routed along these pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the functional properties of feedback and feedforward neurons in the mouse olfactory (piriform) cortex. We selectively labeled neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB, feedback) or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, feedforward) and recorded their activity during passive odor exposure and learning of an odor discrimination task. We found that odor identity and reward associations were encoded by OB-projecting ensembles early during odor exposure, whereas mPFC-projecting neurons encoded this information later, aligned with behavioral responses. Moreover, mPFC-projecting neurons maintained a stable representation of valence across days, while OB-projecting neurons exhibited pronounced plasticity. Together, these findings reveal that odor information is selectively routed through feedforward and feedback pathways and suggest that the functional properties of piriform neurons mirror the computational demands of their downstream targets.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",
