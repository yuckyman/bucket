      "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

      "title": "The speech reception threshold can be estimated using EEG electrodes in and around the ear",
      "content": "Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the speech reception threshold (SRT) can be estimated using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), referred to as SRTneuro. The present study assesses the feasibility of using ear-EEG, which allows for discreet measurement of neural activity from in and around the ear, to estimate the SRTneuro. Approach. Twenty young normal-hearing participants listened to audiobook excerpts at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) whilst wearing a 66-channel EEG cap and 12 ear-EEG electrodes. A linear decoder was trained on different electrode configurations to estimate the envelope of the audio excerpts from the EEG recordings. The reconstruction accuracy was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the actual and the estimated envelope. A sigmoid function was then fitted to the reconstruction-accuracy-vs-SNR data points, with the midpoint of the sigmoid serving as the SRTneuro estimate for each participant. Main results. Using only in-ear electrodes, the estimated SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the behaviorally measured SRT (SRTbeh) for 6 out of 20 participants (30%). With electrodes placed both in and around the ear, the SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants (95%) and thus on par with the reference estimate obtained from full-scalp EEG. Using only electrodes in and around the ear from the right side of the head, the SRTneuro remained within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants. Significance. These findings suggest that the SRTneuro can be reliably estimated using ear-EEG, especially when combining in-ear electrodes and around-the-ear electrodes. Such an estimate can be highly useful e.g. for continuously adjusting noise-reduction algorithms in hearing aids or for logging the SRT in the user\u2019s natural environment.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18672v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People with visual impairments often face significant challenges in locating and retrieving objects in their surroundings. Existing assistive technologies present a trade-off: systems that offer precise guidance typically require pre-scanning or support only fixed object categories, while those with open-world object recognition lack spatial feedback for reaching the object. To address this gap, we introduce 'NaviSense', a mobile assistive system that combines conversational AI, vision-language models, augmented reality (AR), and LiDAR to support open-world object detection with real-time audio-haptic guidance. Users specify objects via natural language and receive continuous spatial feedback to navigate toward the target without needing prior setup. Designed with insights from a formative study and evaluated with 12 blind and low-vision participants, NaviSense significantly reduced object retrieval time and was preferred over existing tools, demonstrating the value of integrating open-world perception with precise, accessible guidance.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18664v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI, which is capable of transforming static content into dynamic learning experiences, holds the potential to revolutionize student engagement in educational contexts. However, questions still remain around whether or not these tools are effective at facilitating student learning. In this research, we test the effectiveness of content transformations through Learn Your Way, an experimental research platform that transforms textbook chapters into dynamic visual and audio representations. Through a between-subjects, mixed methods experiment with 60 US-based students, we demonstrate that students who used Learn Your Way had a more positive learning experience and had better learning outcomes compared to students learning the same content via a digital reader. These findings indicate that AI-driven tools, capable of providing multiple, interactive representations of content, constitute an effective and promising method for enhancing student learning.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18662v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Strength training carries risk of injury when exercises are performed without supervision. While haptics research has advanced, there remains a gap in how to integrate on-body feedback into intelligent wearables. Developing such a design space requires experiencing feedback in context, yet obtaining functional systems is costly. By addressing these challenges, we introduce FlexGuard, a design space for on-body feedback to support injury prevention in strength training. The design space was derived from nine co-design workshops, where novice trainees and expert trainers DIY'd low-fidelity on-body feedback systems, tried them immediately, and surfaced needs and challenges encountered in real exercising contexts. We then evaluated the space through speed dating, using storyboards to cover the design dimensions. We followed up with workshops to further validate selected dimensions in practice through a proof-of-concept wearable system prototype. Our findings extend the design space for sports and fitness wearables in the context of strength training.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.18641v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: If 100 people issue the same search query, they may have 100 different goals. While existing work on user-centric AI evaluation highlights the importance of aligning systems with fine-grained user intents, current search evaluation methods struggle to represent and assess this diversity. We introduce BloomIntent, a user-centric search evaluation method that uses user intents as the evaluation unit. BloomIntent first generates a set of plausible, fine-grained search intents grounded on taxonomies of user attributes and information-seeking intent types. Then, BloomIntent provides an automated evaluation of search results against each intent powered by large language models. To support practical analysis, BloomIntent clusters semantically similar intents and summarizes evaluation outcomes in a structured interface. With three technical evaluations, we showed that BloomIntent generated fine-grained, evaluable, and realistic intents and produced scalable assessments of intent-level satisfaction that achieved 72% agreement with expert evaluators. In a case study (N=4), we showed that BloomIntent supported search specialists in identifying intents for ambiguous queries, uncovering underserved user needs, and discovering actionable insights for improving search experiences. By shifting from query-level to intent-level evaluation, BloomIntent reimagines how search systems can be assessed -- not only for performance but for their ability to serve a multitude of user goals.",

      "title": "null2: Boundary-Dissolving Bodies and Architecture towards Digital Nature",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.18498v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents a case study of the thematic pavilion null2 at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai, contrasting with the static Jomon motifs of Taro Okamoto's Tower of the Sun from Expo 1970. The study discusses Yayoi-inspired mirror motifs and dynamically transforming interactive spatial configuration of null2, where visitors become integrated as experiential content. The shift from static representation to a new ontological and aesthetic model, characterized by the visitor's body merging in real-time with architectural space at installation scale, is analyzed. Referencing the philosophical context of Expo 1970 theme 'Progress and Harmony for Mankind,' this research reconsiders the worldview articulated by null2 in Expo 2025, in which computation is naturalized and ubiquitous, through its intersection with Eastern philosophical traditions. It investigates how immersive experiences within the pavilion, grounded in the philosophical framework of Digital Nature, reinterpret traditional spatial and structural motifs of the tea room, positioning them within contemporary digital art discourse. The aim is to contextualize and document null2 as an important contemporary case study from Expo practices, considering the historical and social background in Japan from the 19th to 21st century, during which world expositions served as pivotal points for the birth of modern Japanese concept of 'fine art,' symbolic milestones of economic development, and key moments in urban and media culture formation. Furthermore, this paper academically organizes architectural techniques, computer graphics methodologies, media art practices, and theoretical backgrounds utilized in null2, highlighting the scholarly significance of preserving these as an archival document for future generations.",
