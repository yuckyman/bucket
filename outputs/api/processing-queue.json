      "title": "Task goals dynamically reconfigure neural working memory representations",
      "content": "A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly shift between tasks and modify our behaviour according to current goals and context. Working memory (WM) is thought to be critical for this cognitive flexibility. A key unanswered question is how neural representations of WM are configured to support different task goals. Thirty-four participants performed a shape WM task with different task rules in interleaved blocks: delayed match-to-sample (DMS) and delayed match-to-category (DMC), while electroencephalography (EEG) was collected. Our results show that stimuli from a circular shape space can be decoded from EEG across the memory delay. Neural stimulus patterns initially generalised across tasks but reconfigured to integrate task and category information and became task-dependent in the later delay. In the DMC task, neural patterns for shapes within a category became more similar than across categories, controlling for their physical distance. This category-dependent shift was associated with greater task-dependency in the neural stimulus representation. Together, our results reveal a dynamic reconfiguration of neural WM representations over the course of the delay period to support distinct task demands.",

      "title": "Oxytocin-dependent reorganization of social vs. food motivational hierarchy and corticostriatal neural activity by social isolation in rats",
      "content": "Social interactions are crucial for the survival and well-being of mammalian individuals. The social homeostasis theory proposes that mammals actively regulate social interactions to maintain an optimal set-point, similar to feeding behavior. Yet, how the social homeostatic drive interacts with competing fundamental needs remains unclear. Moreover, the brain mechanisms underlying social homeostasis are still elusive. A potential such mechanism is oxytocin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide regulating both social and feeding behaviors. We used chronic electrophysiological recordings from behaving rats to analyze local field potential (LFP) signals simultaneously recorded from a network of brain areas associated with reward, motivation, and decision making, while the animals chose between food and social investigation. These experiments were conducted across multiple conditions of social and food deprivation to explore the interplay between the competing needs for food consumption and social interaction. We found that group-housed rats shifted preference toward food under 24-hour food deprivation, whereas socially isolated rats maintained social preference despite equivalent metabolic need. Remarkably, isolation-induced social bias persisted even after one week of re-grouping the animals, indicating long-term reorganization of motivational priorities due to social isolation. LFP recordings revealed that isolated rats exhibited elevated theta power and enhanced network coherence, compared to group-housed rats while making a choice between food to social investigation, regardless of their metabolic state. Canonical correlation analysis demonstrated that metabolic state and housing condition are encoded in orthogonal neural dimensions, suggesting that social isolation creates distinct neural signatures rather than disrupting metabolic state encoding. Systemic administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist restored balanced social-food investigation in isolated rats and selectively suppressed theta oscillations in specific corticostriatal regions during social investigation. These findings establish oxytocin-regulated theta oscillations as a neural substrate through which social experience reorganizes motivational hierarchies. Our results thus demonstrate that social needs can override metabolic drives through oxytocin-dependent modulation of corticostriatal network dynamics.",

      "title": "The Neural Code of Neuroticism",
      "content": "High neuroticism is a risk factor for mental disorders. Understanding whether individuals share a common foundation in brain function underlying neuroticism is therefore an essential goal of neuroscience. We applied Inter-Subject Representational Similarity Analysis on data from 174 Human Connectome Project participants to investigate if their similarity in neuroticism is reflected in their similarity of fMRI-recorded brain activity during movie watching. To test behavioral personality theories that consider trait expression as dependent on situational context, we examined whether brain-trait representational similarity varied between trait-relevant and trait-irrelevant movie scenes (independently rated, N = 86). Higher neuroticism was associated with greater heterogeneity in brain responses, a pattern that was particularly pronounced during trait-relevant scenes. Our study informs dimensional conceptualizations of psychopathology viewing neuroticism as risk factor and extends behavioral personality theories to the neural level. Broadly, it highlights the value of naturalistic imaging and underscores the importance of stimulus selection when investigating brain-behavior associations.",

      "title": "A microcircuit model for initiation and reward-dependent termination of hippocampal replay",
      "content": "Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) serve as a key network state in which the hippocampus replays spatiotemporal patterns that reflect animals' experiences. However, how the hippocampal circuitry controls the generation, duration, and termination of these events remains unclear. To clarify how behaviorally salient locations are encoded into replay, we constructed a biologically plausible model of area CA3, including three classes of inhibitory neurons -- parvalbumin-positive basket cells, cholecystokinin-positive basket cells (CCKBC), and theta-OFF, ripple-ON cells (TORO). In our model, replay and SWRs emerge from TORO-mediated release of CCKBC inhibition onto pyramidal cells, as hypothesized by experiments. Furthermore, our model suggests that short-term depression at TORO-CCKBC synapses controls replay duration and identifies a mechanism through which replay overrepresents reward-associated locations. Our model predicts that replays terminating at these locations are shorter, which we confirm in experimental data. Overall, this study provides a mechanistic framework for SWRs and replay dynamics in the hippocampus.",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "The influence of the maternal microbiome on offspring neurodevelopment: a critical review of associations, controversies, and challenges",
      "content": "The role of the maternal microbiome in offspring neurodevelopment has become a prominent topic in neuroscience, yet its true causal status is under intense scrutiny. This critical review moves beyond conventional deconstructions of popular hypotheses in the field (e.g., \u201cprenatal programming\u201d \u201cwindows of opportunity\u201d) to challenge a more fundamental premise. We systematically argue that the currently observed associations along the \u201cmicrobiota-gut-brain axis\u201d may reflect complex confounding, with macroscopic social factors such as socioeconomic status (SES) being the true underlying drivers. The core thesis of this paper is that the maternal microbiome is, to a great extent, a \u201cbiological imprint\u201d of the mother\u2019s living environment, diet, and stress levels\u2014a highly sensitive \u201cproxy\u201d indicator acting as a biological mediator heavily shaped by the environment, rather than solely as an independent driver. By integrating evidence from social epidemiology, we contend that positioning the microbiome alongside factors like SES in a \u201cflattened\u201d network model is misleading. Instead, we propose a Hierarchical Causal Model where socioeconomic factors act as top-level \u201cmaster regulators,\u201d systematically shaping all downstream biological processes, including the microbiome. Through a critical analysis of interventions such as Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) and vaginal seeding, this review further exposes the translational predicaments that arise from neglecting this hierarchical structure. Ultimately, this review advocates for a paradigm shift: from searching for a single \u201cmicrobial panacea\u201d to understanding the microbiome\u2019s true position within the socio-biological system, and proposes a conceptual framework for future research that is more aligned with real-world complexity and endowed with greater sociological imagination.",

      "title": "Environmental enrichment as a mitochondria-targeting systems strategy across neurodegenerative diseases and retinal dystrophies",
      "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a central contributor to neurodegenerative disorders affecting both the central nervous system and the retina, where impaired energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and defective cellular resilience converge to drive progressive neuronal loss. Environmental enrichment (EE), a multimodal non-pharmacological paradigm, has emerged as a powerful modulator of brain and retinal plasticity in preclinical models, promoting adaptive responses that support mitochondrial function and neurotrophic signaling. This review synthesizes evidence indicating that EE influences mitochondrial quality control, redox homeostasis, synaptic resilience, and neuroimmune balance across a range of experimental models of neurodegeneration and retinal dystrophy. While these effects converge on shared downstream pathways, important disease-, cell-type-, and context-specific differences exist, and mechanistic generalization across systems requires caution. Human studies remain limited, heterogeneous, and often focused on functional outcomes rather than direct biological endpoints, resulting in modest and variable effect sizes. Rather than proposing EE as a stand-alone therapy, we frame it as a system-level, disease-modifying context that may enhance endogenous protective capacity and potentially complement pharmacological, genetic, or rehabilitative interventions, pending disease-specific validation. Forward-looking perspectives, including digitally mediated and AI-supported EE-inspired approaches, are discussed as conceptual strategies whose biological relevance will depend on future studies integrating functional outcomes with validated molecular and metabolic biomarkers. Together, the available evidence positions EE as a biologically grounded, non-invasive framework for promoting neuro- and retino-protective resilience, while underscoring the need for rigorously designed translational and clinical studies to define its therapeutic boundaries and mechanisms of action.",

      "title": "Characterization of vagus nerve active fibers during seizure in rats",
      "content": "Objective. Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million individuals worldwide. Vagus nerve activity is known to be modulated by seizures; however, the types of fibers that are activated during seizures remain unknown. This work compares the electrical activity of the vagus nerve before, during, and after seizures in epileptic rats. Approach. Six rats experiencing pentylenetetrazol-induced epilepsy seizures and two rats under saline solution were investigated. Action potentials (AP) identified by template matching were sorted according to the fiber type they are deemed to originate from. AP templates were based on a 3D COMSOL simplified model of the vagus nerve. Model templates were established for fibers of different diameters based on histology. Correspondences are thus established based on specific fiber diameters. Main results. During seizures, an increase in the percentage of occurrence of APs was observed for 2 \u03bcm and 3 \u03bcm fibers, while a decrease was observed for 4 \u00b5m, 5\u20136 \u00b5m, and 7\u201311 \u00b5m fibers. This was not observed in the rat group under saline solution. The increase in smaller diameter sizes is believed to be linked to an increase in autonomic activity. Significance. These findings contribute to a better understanding of vagus nerve dynamics during epileptic seizures and highlight the potential of vagus nerve activity as a physiological marker for seizure detection and monitoring. This would be of particular interest in vagus nerve stimulation to control any closed-loop form of therapy. This work provides a foundation for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in epilepsy management.",

      "title": "Pathophysiologic similarities between autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease: therapeutic possibilities",
      "content": "The comparison of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) through shared pathophysiologic features offers intriguing insights into the similarities between the two disease states. The authors suggest diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage through the lymphatic system, perivascular system, and nasal turbinates may occur in ASD and AD, and be an important contributing factor in the occurrence of both disorders. Obstruction of the CSF's normal nasal lymphatic drainage results in abnormal processing of the waste proteins tau and amyloid in the brain in both of these disease states. Reproducible research has shown that ASD and AD patients, when compared to normal controls, exhibit increased extra-axial CSF, enlarged perivascular spaces, magnetic resonance imaging evidence of glymphatic dysfunction, and olfactory dysfunction. Some comparisons between the two disease states are robust while others remain speculative. However, the recognition of overlapping pathophysiologic and genetic features between the two disease states not only furthers understanding of these complex conditions, but could also pave the way for novel therapeutic avenues. The goal of this article is to demonstrate the empirically known similarities between ASD and AD and to stimulate research investigating CSF lymphatic drainage through the nasal turbinates. The authors suggest various ways to confirm their findings and provide suggestions for new therapeutic approaches for these disease states aimed at increasing the movement of CSF originating in the brain through the glymphatic system to meningeal and nasal turbinate lymphatics.",

      "title": "Neural representation of action grammar structure in primate frontal cortex",
      "content": "Humans and other animals can solve new problems, even on the first attempt. This capacity to generate novel problem-solving behavior has been hypothesized to depend on brain mechanisms for recombining units of knowledge using systems of procedural rules, or grammars. Yet, whether and how the brain represents and implements grammars remains unclear, in large part due to the lack of neural recordings (typically performed in animal models) during grammar-based problem solving (typically studied in humans). Here, we address that gap, and in turn identify an underlying neural basis of grammatical behavior. We designed a visual-motor construction task in which macaque monkeys trace complex, often novel, geometric figures by generating a sequence of strokes, each a distinct shape, like a circle, dash, or chevron (action symbols [1]). Critically, sequencing was guided by a learned hierarchical action grammar AnBmCk, meaning \"repeat shape A, then repeat shape B, then repeat shape C\", where the number of repetitions (n, m, and k) varied across problems. Behavior was internally generated (no cues guiding stroke order), problem-directed (to construct a specific image), and exhibited zero-shot generalization (successful on the first trial for novel problems, including harder ones)--key hallmarks of grammar use. To identify underlying neural substrates, we recorded from multiple frontal cortical areas previously implicated in rule use or action sequencing. Activity during drawing encoded key structural properties of the action grammar: (i) shape index (A, B, C), (ii) abstract role (e.g., the role A independent of the specific shape), and (iii) ordinal position within a shape repeat. Moreover, all three properties were strongest in a single region, the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA). We suggest that this conjunction of representations is a signature of an implementation of an iterative algorithm resembling a \"for-loop\" program: internally tracking how many repetitions remain for each shape index and switching to the next when complete. Our study establishes a paradigm for studying the neural basis of grammar-guided novel behavior and identifies in preSMA a dynamic representation of grammatical structure supporting such behavior.",

      "title": "The Periaqueductal Gray Selectively Supports Reversal Learning During a Flexible Discrimination Task in Mice",
      "content": "Flexible, goal-directed behavior depends on the ability to update value representations in response to changing contingencies. This ability depends on distributed brain networks, calling for use of whole-brain imaging. Widely used in human research, whole-brain imaging in rodents has been a major challenge that has only recently been properly addressed. Using functional MRI in behaving mice performing a go/no-go odor discrimination task, we compared neural activity during initial cue-reward learning (acquisition) and subsequent contingency reversal. To link neural activity to underlying learning processes, we modeled value updating using a model-free reinforcement-learning algorithm. Trial-by-trial estimates of state-action values allowed us to dissociate acquisition from reversal-related signals, revealing that ventral striatal responses tracked expected value during acquisition, whereas reversal learning additionally recruited the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a midbrain structure classically linked to threat processing and aversive learning. PAG activity closely followed model-derived signatures of reversal learning, implicating it in the suppression of previously rewarded actions and in updating behavior in the absence of explicit punishment. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized computational role for the PAG in value-based decision-making and cognitive flexibility, and substantiate task-fMRI as a powerful tool to study the rodent brain at a mesoscale resolution.",
