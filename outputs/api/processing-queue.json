      "title": "Scaling Environments for Organoid Intelligence with LLM-Automated Design and Plasticity-Based Evaluation",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.04633v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.",

      "title": "Network Models of Neurodegeneration: Bridging Neuronal Dynamics and Disease Progression",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.05151v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the underlying biological mechanisms of disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, and glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden feeds back to disrupt circuit function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, we must develop integrated frameworks that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology. In this review, we survey the two modeling approaches and highlight efforts to unify them. We argue that such integration is necessary to address key questions in neurodegeneration and to inform interventions, from targeted stimulation to control-theoretic strategies that slow progression and restore function.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04454v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: My findings show, for the first time, what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioids induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow wave sleep. Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and other medial habenula activators slowdown respiration during SWS and anesthesia. Using DTI method I observed that human hippocampus is connected to MHb via posterior septum, while amygdala via anteromedial BNST. MHb projected to pineal gland and contralateral MHb (Vadovi\\v{c}ov\\'a, 2014). MHb has dense mu-opioids receptors (Gardon and Faget, 2014) and strong projections to IPN. Herkenham (1981) found increased glucose intake during anesthesia in MHb and IPN. The IPN projects to serotonergic MRN/DRN, and pain/interoception/arousal linked PAG. The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? This extended circuit model explains role of the dentate gyrus >posterior septum >MHb >IPN >MRN >hippocampus + BF + claustrum >cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) in memory replay, loss of awareness, anesthesia and SWS. It proposes new neural mechanisms for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN >MRN >claustrum >cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. This brain model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence and wanting. This model suggests that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, cannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, neuropeptide Y, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-proteins production-spines/synapses growth-anti-inflammatory state.",

      "title": "Computational analysis of optogenetic inhibition of CA1 neurons using a data-efficient and interpretable potassium and chloride conducting opsin model",
      "content": "Objective. Optogenetic inhibition of excitatory neuronal populations has emerged as a potential strategy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. However, achieving effective seizure suppression in animal models using optogenetic techniques has proven challenging. This difficulty can be attributed to a suboptimal stimulation method that involves numerous complex variables. This study aims to examine how various stimulation parameters and opsin characteristics influence the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition protocols. Additionally, a new opsin model is introduced that permits easy implementation of the experimentally derived parameters describing the opsin\u2019s opening and closing dynamics. Approach. The mathematical description of a chloride and potassium conducting opsin was combined with a conductance-based model of a pyramidal CA1 neuron. Simulations with varying parameters were conducted to explore the effects of the stimulation paradigm and the neuronal environment on inhibition. A simplified, adaptable opsin model was used to test the robustness of these results and explore the impact of variations in opsin characteristics. Main results. Stronger inhibition was achieved with higher illumination intensities, pulse repetition frequencies, and duty cycles. Potassium conducting opsins were found to be more stable than chloride conducting ones. These findings were independent of the opsin\u2019s parameters. Additionally, changes in the opsin\u2019s dynamics had negligible impact when the opening and closing time constants were varied by factors between 0.5 and 2. Significance. This study provides key insights into the stimulation and physiological parameters that affect optogenetic inhibition. The findings highlight the importance of choosing the right stimulation protocol and opsin for optimizing optogenetic strategies. The newly developed opsin model also offers a new, valuable tool that will facilitate future research into the development of an improved optogenetic modulation protocol for seizure suppression.",

      "title": "Towards a closed loop retinal prosthesis: measuring electrically evoked retinal responses using large electrodes",
      "content": "Objective. Sensory prostheses use arrays of electrodes to stimulate neural tissue and restore a sense of vision or hearing. At perceptible levels of stimulation, the current from each electrode spreads and causes overlapping regions of neural activation. This lack of specificity results in perceptual deficits. Methods to overcome this reduced specificity, such as a closed loop stimulation approach require measurement of the neural response to stimulation. This investigation tests the possibility of using the large stimulating electrodes such as those required by some subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal implants to measure the neural response to stimulation, an approach similar to Evoked Compound Action Potentials measurements used in cochlear implants. Approach. Ex vivo tissue samples from Long Evans rats with healthy retinas and Royal College of Surgeon rats with retinal degeneration were used to investigate both stimulating and recording from electrodes of the same array. A hexagonal array was used with 20 platinum electrodes with 500 \u03bcm diameter and 700 \u03bcm pitch. Post-stimulus voltage decay was reduced with appropriate tuning of a triphasic stimulation pulse and in post-analysis with a high-pass filter. A method using alternating polarities of biphasic pulses was also trialed. A cocktail of synaptic and ion channel blockers was used to block all neural response including action potentials and thus confirm the biological origin of the signal. Main Results. It was found that a neural signal was observable on electrode that were sufficiently distant from the stimulating electrodes. The signal appeared to be due to direct activation of ganglion cells or possibly mediated via inner retinal neurons. Significance. This result confirms that recording usable neural signals from large electrodes is possible, which is an essential step in implementing a closed loop stimulation strategy for a subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation-induced local evoked potentials outperform spectral features in spatial and clinical STN mapping",
      "content": "Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Yet, optimizing lead placement and stimulation programming remains challenging. Current techniques rely on imaging and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER), while programming relies on trial-and-error clinical testing, which can be time-consuming. DBS-induced local evoked potentials (DLEP), also known as evoked resonant neural activity, have emerged as a potential alternative electrophysiological marker for mapping. However, direct comparisons with traditional spectral features, such as beta-band, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and aperiodic component are lacking. Approach. We evaluated DLEP across 39 STN DBS leads in 31 subjects with PD undergoing DBS surgery, using both a single-pulse and high-frequency (HF) burst stimulation paradigms. We developed a novel artifact-removal method to enable monopolar DLEP recovery, including estimating the DLEP amplitudes at stimulated contacts, further enhancing spatial sampling of DLEP. We evaluated spectral features and DLEP in respect to imaging-based and MER-based localization, and its predictive power for post-operative programming. Main results. DLEP showed great spatial consistency, maximizing within STN with 100% accuracy for single-pulse and 84.62% for burst stimulation, surpassing spectral measures including beta (89.74%) and HFO (82.05%). DLEP better correlated with clinical outcomes (single-pulses \u03c1 = \u22120.33, HF bursts \u03c1 = \u22120.26), than spectral measures (beta \u03c1 = \u22120.25, HFO \u03c1 = 0.05). Furthermore, single-pulses at low-frequencies are sufficient for DLEP-based mapping. Significance. We show how DLEP provide higher STN-spatial specificity and correlation with postoperative programming compared to spectral features. To support clinical translation of DLEP, we developed two methods aimed to recover artifact-free DLEP and estimating DLEP amplitudes at stimulating contacts. DLEP appear distinct from beta and HFO activity, yet strongly tied to aperiodic spectral components, suggesting that DLEP amplitude reflects underlying STN excitability. This study highlights that DLEP are a robust and clinically valuable marker for DBS targeting and programming.",

A less-common target is ``higher-order\" representations (HORs), which are ``about\" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs\" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation\" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.",

      "title": "The dynamic interplay between in-context and in-weight learning in humans and neural networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2402.08674v5 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of \"in-context learning\" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.",

      "content": "arXiv:2208.09677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.",

      "title": "Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning",
      "content": "arXiv:2508.13846v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05041v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We show that asymmetric deep recurrent neural networks, enhanced with additional sparse excitatory couplings, give rise to an exponentially large, dense accessible manifold of internal representations which can be found by different algorithms, including simple iterative dynamics. Building on the geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap between AI and computational neuroscience.",
