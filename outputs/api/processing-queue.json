      "title": "Functional and Structural Plasticity in Cocaine-Seeking Ensembles of the Nucleus Accumbens Core",
      "content": "Relapse vulnerability in substance use disorder (SUD) is primarily driven by cue-induced activation of neurons within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), among other contributing factors. Neuronal ensembles within the NAcore, defined here as selectively co-activated neurons during specific behavioral experiences, are essential during cocaine sensitization and recall. While transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP) has been widely observed in general neuronal populations within the NAcore during reinstatement, its ensemble-specific dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used c-Fos-TRAP2-based tagging to identify cocaine-seeking ensembles in mice following cocaine intravenous self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement. Structural spine plasticity was assessed via confocal microscopy, and functional changes were measured using whole-cell electrophysiology across multiple reinstatement time points. Ensemble neurons exhibited enhanced dendritic spine head diameter (dh) and AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratios following cue exposure, consistent with t-SP. Notably, spine classification revealed a reduction in mature spines during reinstatement, suggesting morphological remodeling rather than new spine formation in both ensemble and non-ensemble cells. Non-ensemble neurons exhibited classical functional transient synaptic plasticity, characterized by increased A/N ratios but no significant changes in dh. To begin assessing if presynaptic vesicle release impacts t-SP, paired-pulse ratio analysis indicated no differences in population or time point. Importantly, ensemble neurons displayed elevated A/N ratio following cocaine exposure, suggesting prior silent synapse maturation. These findings demonstrate that t-SP is not uniformly distributed across NAcore neurons but differs significantly between ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. By linking ensemble identity to both structural and functional plasticity, this study refines our understanding of cue-induced relapse mechanisms.",

      "title": "Iron Deficiency Impairs Mitochondrial Energetics and Early Axonal Growth and Branching in Developing Hippocampal Neurons",
      "content": "Each stage of neuronal development (i.e., proliferation, differentiation, migration, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation) requires functional and highly coordinated metabolic activity to ultimately ensure proper sculpting of complex neural networks. Energy deficits underlie many neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases implicating mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target. Iron is necessary for neuronal energy output through its direct role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Iron deficiency (ID) reduces mitochondrial respiratory and energy capacity in developing hippocampal neurons, causing permanently simplified dendritic arbors and impaired learning and memory. However, the effect of ID on early axonogenesis has not been explored. We used an embryonic mixed-sex primary mouse hippocampal neuron culture model of developmental ID to evaluate mitochondrial respiration and dynamics and effects on axonal morphology. At 7 days in vitro (DIV), ID impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity and stunted growth of both the primary axon and branches, without affecting branch number. Mitochondrial motility was not altered by ID, suggesting that mitochondrial energy production --- not trafficking --- underlie the axon morphological deficits. These findings provide the first link between iron-dependent neuronal energy production and early axon structural development and emphasize the importance of maintaining sufficient iron during gestation to prevent the negative consequences of ID on brain health across the lifespan.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

I flat out just don't know where I want to go next, even applying to sales roles has fallen flat.<p>I have good contacts for law school, but the notion of burning $200k on the chance that law is still a viable career with AI seems like an even worse decision than logic I applied in my 20s.<p>Cheers.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45599308\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45599308</a></p>\n<p>Points: 17</p>\n<p># Comments: 11</p>",

      "title": "Electrical synapses mediate visual approach behavior",
      "content": "Detecting salient visual objects and orienting toward them are commonplace tasks for animals, yet the underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. The fruit fly is an ideal model for a comprehensive analysis of feature detection mechanisms given its complete synaptic wiring diagrams, robust behavioral assays, and cell-type-specific gene expression datasets. We previously showed that columnar visual neurons T3 are required for saccadic orientation toward landscape features during flight. Here, we examine how signals downstream of T3 are processed in the central brain. We identify the LC17 type of visual projection neurons as key postsynaptic targets: they receive strong excitatory input from T3, project to premotor brain regions, and are thus positioned to support visual approach. Using in vivo optical physiology and virtual reality behavior, we demonstrate that LC17 neurons are indeed necessary for object tracking during flight. Furthermore, we find that electrical synapses in LC17 are also required for tracking behavior. Accordingly, we show that the innexin Shaking B (shakB) is highly expressed in LC17 dendrites, and genetic perturbations confirm an essential role for gap junctional coupling in this circuit. Our findings reveal mechanisms underlying visual approach, and highlight the interplay between electrical and chemical neurotransmission for rapid object detection and action selection.",

      "title": "Region-specific human brain organoids reveal synaptic and cell state drivers of glioblastoma invasion",
      "content": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly heterogenous and malignant brain tumor, in part because it disrupts normal brain circuits to fuel its own growth and invasion. Thus, there is a need to identify the molecular features of invasive GBM cells and their regulators in the neural microenvironment. To address this in a fully human model, we engrafted patient-derived GBM cells (total n=15 independent samples) from three sources - fresh neurosurgical resections, cell lines, and whole GBM organoids - into human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids patterned to forebrain, midbrain, and spinal cord identities. GBM cells from all sources infiltrated brain organoids within 2 days post-engraftment, reaching maximal invasion by day 14. Across organoids of distinct spatial and maturational milieu, GBM cells showed a consistent reduction in astrocyte-like states and an enrichment in neuron/glia progenitor-like (NPC-like) states. These NPC-like GBM cells expressed neuronal and synaptic machinery, and tumors enriched in this transcriptomic state prior to engraftment achieved greater organoid coverage, suggesting enhanced infiltration and synaptic integration of this GBM cell type. Although GBM cell states converged across organoid types after engraftment, infiltration was greater in the forebrain than spinal cord. This is likely reflective of synaptic input from deep-layer TBR1 excitatory neurons in the forebrain, as demonstrated by a combination of rabies-based monosynaptic tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. In contrast, inhibitory neurons were the predominant synaptic partners of GBM in the spinal cord. Together, this fully human model of the neural-GBM connectome reveals how neuron-like GBM states and regionally distinct synaptic inputs cooperatively shape tumor invasion.",

      "title": "Auditory Stimulus Information Entropy Modulates Inter-Brain Synchronization: Evidence from Wireless EEG Hyperscanning",
      "content": "Inter-brain synchronization (IBS) -- reflecting inter-individual correlated neural activity during interaction -- marks shared experiences like music listening. The ability of complex auditory stimuli (e.g., music) to induce IBS links to their information dynamics, notably the uncertainty they evoke, which challenges the nervous system's predictive coding. Based on mutual prediction theory (interacting individuals simultaneously process their own behavior and predict their partner's; accurate mutual predictions lead to convergent neural representations and thus IBS), this study hypothesized that higher stimulus uncertainty enhances IBS (heightened uncertainty reduces independent predictability, promoting convergent representations and stronger IBS). Using information entropy to quantify uncertainty, the study conducted hyperscanning, manipulated entropy across Resting State and 6 Hz auditory stimuli (ASSR, MMN, AHER, Dream Wedding), and measured IBS via phase-locking values (PLV). Results showed frequency specificity: 6 Hz PLV increased with entropy (DW {approx} AHER > MMN {approx} ASSR > Resting State); Alpha band had highest PLV in Resting State. Critically, PLVs differed significantly between any two conditions, and each experimental condition's PLV was also significantly different from that of the Resting State. Findings confirm a 6 Hz-specific positive association between auditory uncertainty and IBS, suggesting musical elements may facilitate social interaction by modulating entropy, with entropy-IBS relations showing frequency dependence.",

      "title": "AAV-mediated overexpression of Prdm12 in knee-innervating afferents reduces inflammatory joint pain and neuronal hyperexcitability in mice",
      "content": "Inflammatory joint pain features in numerous musculoskeletal disorders that affect millions globally. The Prdm12 gene encodes a conserved zinc finger transcriptional regulator expressed selectively in the nervous system. In humans, PRDM12 mutations can cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) or midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES). Prdm12 is prominently expressed in developing somatosensory ganglia, where it plays a crucial role in nociceptive neuron development, its expression being maintained in mature C-LTMRs (C-low threshold mechanoreceptors) and nociceptive neurons. Despite enhanced understanding of Prdm12's role in neuronal excitability and pain behavior, the impact of Prdm12 overexpression in mature nociceptive neurons has not been explored. Here, we conducted intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.S viral vectors encoding Prdm12-GFP (Prdm12-AAV) or GFP alone (Control-AAV), observing no overt changes in mouse behavior. When examining the properties of Prdm12 overexpressing sensory neurons in vitro, we observed an increase in rheobase alongside decreased neuronal responses to capsaicin and ATP, indicating a downregulation of TRPV1 and P2X ion channels activity, respectively. We next conducted intraarticular administration of viral constructs in female mice to determine how Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating sensory neurons alters their excitability and influences inflammatory joint pain induced by intraarticular administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating neurons decreased inflammation-induced changes in digging and weight bearing, prevented inflammation-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, and decreased macroscopic voltage-gated ion channel conductance. Our findings illustrate that Prdm12 overexpression strongly modulates neuronal excitability in adult animals, highlighting its importance in pain perception and its potential as an analgesic target.",

      "title": "The impact of the serotonergic psychedelic DOI on active vision in freely moving mice",
      "content": "Psychedelic compounds have the ability to generate altered states of consciousness and profoundly distort perception, often resulting in visual hallucinations. While psychedelics have recently regained attention for their potential cognitive and therapeutic effects, how these drugs affect visual processing to generate visual distortions and hallucinations is not as well characterized. Furthermore, studies investigating the effect of psychedelics on visual function have all been done using head-fixed preparations, preventing animals from engaging in the natural visual behaviors that the visual system evolved to support. To determine the impact of psychedelics on active vision, we recorded neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of mice during free movement, while simultaneously recording eye and head position, before and after administration of the serotonergic psychedelic DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine). We find that DOI increases the frequency of visual active sensing behaviors during free movement and leads to a net reduction in the visually-evoked activity that these behaviors generate in V1. The effect of DOI was highly diverse across the population of V1 neurons, driving suppression and facilitation of visual responses in a laminar specific manner. Finally, the effects of DOI were dependent upon both visual input and the statistics of the stimulus. We found a striking dissociation between impact on gaze shift responses and flashed sparse noise presented during head-fixation, which may reflect predictability of the stimulus. These findings provide insights into how psychedelics disrupt sensory processing and the neural mechanisms underlying these altered perceptual states.",

      "title": "Adolescent Alcohol Exposure Disrupts Astrocyte-Synaptic Structural And Functional Coupling In The Male Dorsal Hippocampus",
      "content": "Adolescence is a window of heightened vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of binge ethanol exposure. Adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure has been shown to induce long lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments in patients and rodent models that increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). Our previous work shows that these behavioral deficits coincide with persistent dysfunction of astrocytes. Here, we aim to understand how astrocyte synaptic structural and functional crosstalk are disrupted following AIE to provide better mechanistic understanding of why behavioral impairments persist into adulthood. Male Sprague Dawley rats received AIE, a variety of adeno-associated viruses encoding astrocyte specific sensors, and fiber implantation in the dorsal hippocampal (dHipp) for in vivo photometry. A subset of rats received hM3D(Gq) to chemogenetically activate astrocytes. Following AIE and a forced abstinence period that allowed growth into adulthood, rats underwent assessment in the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task with simultaneous fiber photometry recordings. By combining immunohistochemistry (IHC), Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and slice physiology, we show that AIE induces structural and functional decoupling of astrocytes from synapses and astrocyte dysregulation that persists into adulthood. Remarkably, stimulating astrocytic calcium signaling via chemogenetic activation attenuates heightened fear responding and restores gliotransmitter availability. These findings highlight a critical role for astrocyte synaptic crosstalk in regulating fear learning and underscore the untapped therapeutic potential of targeting astrocytes to improve behavioral outcomes following substance use.",

      "title": "ARHGEF17 Deficiency Induces Endothelial Dysfunction and Intracranial Aneurysm Formation via RhoA/ROCK2/MLC Signaling Pathway",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility critically contributes to intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture, but the mechanisms linking genetic variants to vascular dysfunction remain unclear. ARHGEF17, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulating RhoA activation and cytoskeletal dynamics, has been identified as a potential IA risk gene. METHODS: CRISPR-Cas9-generated ARHGEF17-/- mice and morpholino-based ARHGEF17-deficient zebrafish were used to assess in vivo vascular effects. An elastase/DOCA-induced IA model evaluated aneurysm formation, rupture, and survival. Vascular remodeling of the Circle of Willis was analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence. Endothelial function was examined in HUVECs with lentiviral ARHGEF17 knockdown. Activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling was assessed by G-LISA and Western blotting, with Y-27632 used to test ROCK2 dependence. RESULTS: ARHGEF17 deficiency increased IA incidence and rupture, accompanied by elastic fiber fragmentation, VSMC dedifferentiation, and inflammatory activation. Zebrafish lacking ARHGEF17 exhibited intracranial hemorrhage and vascular instability. In endothelial cells, ARHGEF17 silencing impaired proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and barrier integrity while activating the RhoA/ROCK2/MLC pathway. ROCK inhibition with Y-27632 restored endothelial function and cytoskeletal organization. CONCLUSIONS: ARHGEF17 maintains cerebrovascular integrity by regulating RhoA/ROCK2/MLC-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics. Its deficiency drives endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and IA formation, while ROCK inhibition reverses these effects, identifying the RhoA/ROCK2 axis as a therapeutic target for ARHGEF17 mutation-associated IAs.",
