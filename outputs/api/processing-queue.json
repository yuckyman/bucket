      "content": "<p>Yesterday my production app went down. The cause? DigitalOcean's managed PostgreSQL update broke private VPC connectivity to their managed Kubernetes.<p>Public endpoint worked. Private endpoint timed out. Root cause: a Cilium bug (#34503) where ARP entries go stale after infrastructure changes.<p>DO support responded relatively quickly (<12hrs). Their fix? Deploy a DaemonSet from a random GitHub user to ping stale ARP entries every 10 seconds. The upstream Cilium fix is merged but not yet deployed to DOKS. No ETA.<p>I chose managed services specifically to avoid ops emergencies. We're a tiny startup paying the premium so someone else handles this. Instead, I spent late night hours debugging VPC routing issues in a networking layer I don't control.<p>HN's usual advice is \"just use managed services, focus on the business.\" Generally good advice. But managed doesn't mean worry-free, it means trading your failure modes for the vendor's failure modes. You're not choosing between problems and no problems. You're choosing between problems you control and (fewer?) problems you don't.<p>Still using DO. Still using managed services. Just with fewer illusions about what \"managed\" means.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46596075\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46596075</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "fMRI-Based Prediction of Eye Gaze During Naturalistic Movie Viewing Reveals Eye-Movement-Related Brain Activity",
      "content": "Eye gaze and eye movements provide important indices of perceptual and cognitive processes, particularly under naturalistic conditions such as movie viewing. However, concurrent eye tracking is often unavailable in functional MRI (fMRI) studies due to technical and logistical constraints. Recent deep learning approaches have made it possible to estimate eye gaze directly from eyeball signals in fMRI data, offering a potential alternative to camera-based eye tracking. Here, we applied a pre-trained fMRI-based deep neural network model (DeepMReye) to estimate eye gaze during movie watching across three independent fMRI datasets. Model performance was evaluated by comparison with camera-based eye-tracking data when available, as well as by assessing inter-individual correlations, a commonly used benchmark in naturalistic fMRI research. At the individual level, predicted gaze showed modest correspondence with measured data (r ranged from 0.38 to 0.67). In contrast, group-averaged gaze predictions exhibited substantially higher correlations (r ranged from 0.7 to 0.8), indicating improved reliability at the group level. We further derived eye-movement-related time series from the predicted gaze signals and examined their associated brain activity. Consistent with differences in prediction accuracy, individual-level analyses yielded activation patterns largely restricted to visual cortex, whereas group-averaged predictions revealed more widespread activation, including established oculomotor control regions such as frontal and parietal eye fields. Exploratory analyses indicated age-related effects on gaze prediction accuracy and eye-movement-related brain activity, although these effects were not consistent across datasets. Together, these findings demonstrate that group-averaged fMRI-based gaze estimation can support the investigation of eye-movement-related brain activity in naturalistic paradigms, while highlighting current limitations for individual-level inference. The results provide a methodological assessment of fMRI-based gaze prediction and inform its appropriate use in future neuroimaging studies.",

      "title": "Inflammatory signaling differentially changes chromatin accessibility and gene expression of the PD- associated kinase LRRK2 between human and mice",
      "content": "The genomic locus that encodes the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene is highly pleiotropic, being associated with both Parkinsons disease (PD) and Crohns disease (CD). Coding variants associated with risk of PD and CD act as gain of function kinase mutations increasing phosphorylation of RAB substrates, and non-coding variants in the promoter region of LRRK2 increase expression of the gene, notably in immune cells. If regulation of LRRK2 expression is a causal contributor to age-related diseases, it is important to understand the mechanism(s) by which LRRK2 is regulated, particularly in the context of inflammation. Here, we show that interferon-gamma exposure induces robust LRRK2 activation in human iPSC derived microglia through signaling of the Janus-activated Kinase complex to phosphorylate STAT1, which then binds to the LRRK2 promoter and is associated with remodeling of chromatin structure in this genomic locus. Additional regulatory mechanisms include the stress-induced transcription factor and long non-coding RNA encoded at the same locus, resulting in increased LRRK2 mRNA levels. We also show evidence of the same effect in acutely cultured human brain slices. While we were unable to demonstrate any induction of Lrrk2 mRNA in the mouse brain, the introduction of a human bacterial artificial chromosome transgene into the mouse genome recapitulated sensitivity to interferon-gamma in microglia. A comparative genomic analysis across mammals suggests that these species differences are driven by regulatory regions upstream of LRRK2 that are specific to anthropoid primates. These results demonstrate that there are differences between species in how genes associated with human diseases are regulated and provide important information that should be incorporated in disease modeling.",

      "title": "Location and mapping of the human rostromedial tegmental nucleus and associated midbrain inhibitory nuclei regulating dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Background: Animal experiments reveal distinct GABAergic cell clusters within the dopaminergic midbrain regions in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) and retrorubral fields (RRF) that have yet to be clearly defined in humans. These neurons send prominent inhibitory projections to dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area that impact motor, reward and threat processing. Objective: To identify GABergic RMTg and RRF cell clusters in the human brain. Methods: Ten m formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded transverse human brainstem sections from ten control cases were obtained from the Sydney Brain Bank and immunohistochemistry for GABA and tyrosine hydroxylase was used to determine the location and cell size of RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons. These cell populations were further mapped in transverse 50m thick cresyl violet stained serial midbrain sections (every 750m) from previously published controls (Halliday et al. 1990a). Results: GABAergic neurons were cytoarchitecturally distinct, with the largest GABAergic neurons in the RRF, followed by RMTg neurons which were larger than GABAergic neurons in the interpedunclular nucleus (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.0001). RMTg and RRF GABAergic neurons first appear in caudal transverse midbrain sections approximately 38mm above the obex. RMTg moves rostrally and medially from underneath the decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncle to just lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus. The RRF cluster also moves rostrally and medially to the parabrachial pigmented nucleus (PBP) just under the red nucleus. Conclusion: The GABAergic neurons in RMTg and RRF/PBP that modulate dopamine neuronal excitability have distinct morphologies in humans. Identifying these inhibitory neurons is key to evaluating their role in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Loss of contractile pericytes and their impaired calcium dynamics exacerbate brain ischemic stroke of awake mice in acute and chronic phases",
      "content": "Ischemic stroke frequently results in persistent neurovascular uncoupling, whereby neuronal activity fails to evoke appropriate microvascular responses despite restoration of upstream blood flow. The cellular mechanisms governing this dysfunction along the arteriolar-capillary continuum remain poorly understood. Using two-photon microscopy and laser speckle imaging in awake Acta2-GCaMP8 mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, we examined calcium signaling and contractile function of vascular smooth muscle cells, precapillary sphincters (PS), and contractile pericytes during stroke progression. During acute phase, PSs exhibited pronounced calcium elevations and strong constriction, amplifying downstream capillary constriction through spatially localized calcium signaling. Following reperfusion, excessive calcium elevations persisted without proportional diameter changes, indicating calcium signaling dysregulation and early uncoupling between mural cell calcium dynamics and vascular responses. In the chronic phase, ischemia induced PS-associated loss of contractile pericytes, leading to capillary dilation and sustained impairment of neurovascular coupling. Although pericyte coverage and calcium signaling partially recovered from second week post stroke, whisker-evoked vascular responses and calcium sensitivity remained compromised. At the network level, blood flow responses became spatially heterogeneous, with pericyte-lost regions exhibiting prolonged hyporesponsiveness during functional hyperemia. These findings identify PSs as key regulators of ischemia-induced microvascular dysfunction and highlight mural cell calcium dysregulation and pericyte loss as drivers of persistent neurovascular uncoupling after stroke.",

      "title": "ANKS1B in the Nucleus Accumbens controls escalated cocaine self-administration via regulating CBP-FoxO3 complex",
      "content": "The transition from controlled to escalated drug intake is a core feature of cocaine use disorder (CUD), yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavioral escalation remain poorly defined. Our prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified ANKS1B as a significant shared genetic risk factor for heroin, methamphetamine, and alcohol dependence, suggesting a broad role in addiction vulnerability. However, the specific function of ANKS1B in cocaine addiction and its associated neural mechanisms were unknown. Here, we found that ANKS1B expression level in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) was downregulated after extended cocaine use, and manipulating ANKS1B could selectively influence the escalation of cocaine intake and the subsequent cocaine-seeking behavior in the long-access cocaine self-administration rat model. Molecular experiments reveal that ANKS1B interacts with the histone acetyltransferase CBP to control H3K27 acetylation and extended cocaine intake, via epigenetically repressing the transcription factor FoxO3. Overall, these findings suggest that ANKS1B is a crucial factor influencing the escalation of cocaine use. The ANKS1B-CBP-FoxO3 signaling pathway presents a promising target for potential therapeutic interventions for controlling extended cocaine use.",

      "title": "A Quantitative Benchmark of Visual Information in Human Brain Recordings Across fMRI, MEG, and EEG",
      "content": "Noninvasive human brain recordings such as fMRI, MEG, and EEG are widely used to study visual representations, yet their relative information content has never been quantitatively benchmarked under matched experimental conditions. Here, we develop a unified decoding framework that enables fair cross-modal comparison using identical naturalistic stimuli (THINGS) and a common decoding analysis. Using a matched stimulus set, we first quantify modality performance via object-category decoding accuracy. Under these conditions, fMRI yielded the highest accuracy (mean 87%), MEG showed intermediate performance (mean 35%), and single-subject EEG achieved lower accuracy (mean 7%), while remaining reliably above chance level (1%). Notably, EEG performance improved substantially when decoding outputs were aggregated across participants in the form of a stimulus-level relational structure, yielding a group-level EEG measure (28%) with accuracy comparable to MEG. We then examined how decoding performance scales with the number of training stimuli and effective measurement time. These analyses revealed distinct efficiency-precision trade-offs across modalities: MEG and group-level EEG were most efficient for short measurement times, whereas fMRI achieved the highest asymptotic performance when sufficient data were collected. Together, these findings demonstrate that modality performance differs systematically even under tightly matched conditions and that decoding provides a principled way to assess the information content of fMRI, MEG, and EEG. The proposed unified framework offers practical guidelines for modality selection, experimental design, and data collection planning in neuroscience.",
