      "title": "The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis: How predictive coding of CT-touch explains Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response and its therapeutic applications.",
      "content": "Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) is a pleasant tingling sensation felt across the scalp and neck, widely reported to reduce anxiety and improve sleep. The Proximity Prediction Hypothesis (PPH) is the first comprehensive predictive coding model explaining ASMR's underlying neural mechanism. PPH posits that near-field acoustic cues from common ASMR triggers (e.g., brushing sounds, whispered speech) engage the audio-tactile Peripersonal Space Network, generating a top-down prediction of gentle C-tactile (CT) touch on CT fibre-rich skin of the scalp and neck. This prediction suppresses locus coeruleus (LC) arousal and increases vagal output, offering a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon's therapeutic benefits. In a subjective-experience survey (N = 64), ASMR-labelled trials were rated significantly more pleasant but only slightly more arousing than controls. Pleasantness predicted both the presence and intensity of tingles, supporting PPH's core claim that hedonic value, rather than sympathetic activation, drives the graded somatosensory response. PPH situates ASMR within the Neurovisceral Integration framework, predicting measurable Central Nervous System-Autonomic Nervous System (CNS-ANS) markers (beta-band desynchronisation in the posterior insula and proportional increases in high-frequency heart rate variability with tingle intensity). It further predicts reduced LC activity during ASMR, stronger effects in individuals with high interoceptive prediction error (e.g., anxiety, autism), and attenuation of tingles when spatial proximity cues are removed. By integrating auditory proximity, CT-touch anticipation, and autonomic regulation into a single predictive-coding account, PPH provides a unified, testable framework for explaining ASMR, offering a blueprint for translating this sensory phenomenon into targeted, evidence-based interventions for anxiety and sleep disorders.",

Antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), a cost-effective intervention recognized for its potential to improve maternal and neonatal health, reduces risks of low birth weight, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and stillbirth while offering a $37 return for every $1 invested. Despite...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Atropine (0.05%) use disrupted accommodation significantly over 10 days and increased convergence at near. While near heterophoria shifted towards esophoria, participants' ability to counteract this was also diminished by a reduction in NFV. This suggests that the near heterophoria and fusional reserves of children using 0.05% atropine for myopia control should be monitored closely.",

For example, high-pitched (vs low-pitched) sounds are commonly associated with elevated (vs low) positions in space, and rounded (vs angular) shapes tend to be linked to the term 'Bouba' (vs 'Kiki'). There is still some debate about the role of immediate sensory experience versus conceptual colour understanding in crossmodal correspondences. In...",

Edible berries of blackcurrant (BC) and its extracted anthocyanins (BCAs) have beneficial effects on human eyes. However, the effect of BCAs on the perception of moving objects and other dynamic visual patterns remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether BCAs improve visual movement perception in aging mice. The aging mice were fed either a standard diet or a standard diet containing BC....",
