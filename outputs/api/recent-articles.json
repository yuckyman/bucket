      "title": "A Pilot Study on Fabric-Based Pneumatic Soft Gloves for Assisting Patients With Severe Brachial Plexus Injury",
      "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

      "content": "The open-source development model has been successfully applied to consumer and enterprise software, and recently to consumer hardware. Medical devices may become a beneficiary of this trend, as open-source medical device development has the potential to reduce costs, democratize patient access, and provide continued support to abandoned devices from failed companies. Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology. This review of open-source medical device development explores the current state of development in research and clinical products and suggests best practices for creating sustainable and effective open-source medical devices.",

      "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
      "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Distinctive Functionality of Semantic Hubs: Evidence from Semantic Dementia",
      "content": "Semantic cognition relies on a distributed network with multiple candidate hub regions that bind multimodal conceptual information. While the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) is widely regarded as a core semantic hub, the roles of other candidate regions such as the fusiform gyrus (FFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) remain debated, particularly regarding verbal and non-verbal semantic processing within the same sensory modality. This study examined 33 patients with semantic dementia and 20 healthy controls using a comprehensive behavioral battery (word and picture versions of the Pyramid and Palm Trees Test and a word picture verification task) combined with multimodal neuroimaging, including voxel based morphometry, diffusion-weighted imaging, and resting-state fMRI. Partial correlation and commonality analyses revealed that (1) the left ATL selectively underpins abstract verbal semantic processing, (2) the left FFG contributes to general semantic processing across verbal and non-verbal stimuli, (3) and the left pMTG plays a critical role in integrating verbal and non verbal semantic information. White matter tracts linking the left ATL and FFG to the right ATL significantly predicted semantic integration performance, underscoring the importance of inter hemispheric structural connectivity. Functional measures in contralateral regions, including amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the right FFG and degree centrality (DC) in the right pMTG, also predicted integration outcomes, suggesting compensatory network reorganization. These findings highlight functional specialization among semantic hubs and underscore the importance of multimodal, cross-hemispheric approaches for understanding the neural architecture of semantic representation.",

      "title": "Metabolic Dysfunction Underlying Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Elevated Lactate and Impaired Post-Exercise Creatine Response in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex",
      "content": "Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is characterised by altered brain metabolism and increased chronic perceived fatigue. However, the relationship between brain metabolites, fatigue, and physical task effects in MS remains unclear. This study investigated brain metabolite concentrations (glutamate + glutamine (Glx), lactate, and total creatine (tCr)) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a region involved in interoceptive processing, before and after a physical task. Methods: Twenty-two people with MS (pwMS) and 22 controls underwent Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy before and after fatiguing wrist extension tasks. Linear mixed models analysed group differences and exercise-induced metabolite changes. Results: PwMS showed higher ACC lactate concentrations than controls at rest and post-exercise (F = 7.08, p = 0.011, 95% CI[0.033, 0.228]). No significant Glx differences were observed. A significant group x exercise interaction for tCr occurred (F = 4.63, p = 0.037, 95% CI[0.027, 0.581]), with tCr decreasing post-exercise in controls (t = 3.09, p = 0.02) but remaining stable in pwMS. Changes in lactate correlated moderately with perceived effort in pwMS (r = 0.51, p = 0.04). Conclusions: This study provides novel evidence of metabolic differences in pwMS, characterised by elevated lactate and stable post-exercise tCr, suggesting altered energy metabolism potentially linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.",
