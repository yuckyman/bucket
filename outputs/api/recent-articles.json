      "title": "Odor-induced Sustained Neural Activity during Memory Encoding",
      "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

      "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
      "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

      "title": "On the Causal Role of the Right Lateral Prefrontal Cortex in Active Forgetting",
      "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

      "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
      "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

      "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
      "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

      "title": "Representing Visual Objects, Attention, and Load in Human Occipito-temporal and Posterior Parietal Cortices",
      "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

      "title": "Bilateral Field Advantage of Spatial Attention in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex",
      "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

      "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

      "content": "Sex hormone fluctuations modulate structural and functional brain dynamics, yet little is known how sex steroid levels map onto the expression of sex differences in the brain. Here, we trained machine learning models for brain sex classification based on anatomical structures in cross-sectional data of N = 1090 individuals (50% females, age matched). Applied to dense sampled data of one male and two females in different hormonal states (naturally cycling, oral contraceptive user, pregnancy), we linked inter- and intra-individual fluctuations in brain sex to neuroendocrine modulation. We found lower variation in brain sex across time in the male compared to the female subjects. Oral contraceptive use was associated with a more female-like brain, while (inverted) U-shaped brain sex trajectories emerged across menstrual cycle phases and pregnancy trimesters. Overall, our findings suggest that changes in brain sex capture hormone-related plasticity over time in dense sampled individuals.",

      "content": "Microglia are highly plastic cells that are capable of integrating subsequent insults. As the majority of Alzheimers Disease (AD) patients also show cerebrovascular pathology, we here aimed to dissect the interactions between AD and ischemic brain injury on the microglial response to amyloid beta pathology. Surprisingly, we find that ischemic stroke in the presence of cerebral amyloid beta-amyloidosis results in the generation of a novel neuroprotective microglial phenotype. These microglia drive a rapid accumulation of highly dense amyloid beta plaques that exhibit a relatively benign nature and are strikingly similar to Amyloid beta plaques observed in patients that are resilient to AD pathology. Thus, our data do not only highlight the impact of a co-morbid state of brain ischemia and amyloid beta pathology on the microglial phenotype but also identify novel molecular pathways that may serve to promote beneficial microglial functions in AD.",
