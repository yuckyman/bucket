      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I come from a data science background, I wanted a project to learn better software engineering practices. After days of coding and debugging, I\u2019m happy with <code>whai</code>, a fast terminal assistant built in Python.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>whai is a CLI assistant you call on-demand when you're stuck in your terminal. You can ask it why a command failed or how to do something (<code>whai speed up this video</code>). It reads your recent terminal activity for context, suggests a command, explains it, and waits for your approval.</p> <h1>Why It\u2019s Different</h1> <p>Most AI terminal tools I tried didn't suit me: they either take over your entire shell (forcing you into a REPL) or run commands without supervision.</p> <p><code>whai</code> takes a different approach. It works inside your native shell, never interrupts you, and never runs a command without your explicit approval. The goal is to act as a helpful expert you can ask for help and learn from.</p> <h1>My Learning Experience</h1> <p>This was my first time building a distributable Python app, and the journey was a change from my typical data science workflow. And I got to leverage and adopt some new packages.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> I fell in love with <code>uv</code> for its speed (bye <code>conda</code>) and extensive <code>pytest</code> testing. Combining this with with <code>nox</code> to automate testing across multiple Python versions feels like magic.</li> <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Setting up an automated CI/CD using tags pipeline is so nice to have. Having it use <code>uv</code>, <code>pytest</code> and <code>nox</code> really simplified publishing and gave me peace of mind.</li> </ul> <p>If you spend a lot of time in the terminal, you can check it out here:</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/gael-vanderlee/whai\">https://github.com/gael-vanderlee/whai</a></p> <p>You can install it with <code>uv tool install whai</code> (or <code>pipx</code> or <code>pip</code>) or try it without installing using <code>uvx whai &quot;your question&quot;</code>.</p> <p>Would love any feedback, ideas, or bug reports.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gueleric\"> /u/Gueleric </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxz29u/i_took_a_break_from_data_science_to_build_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxz29u/i_took_a_break_from_data_science_to_build_my/\">[comments]</a></span>",
