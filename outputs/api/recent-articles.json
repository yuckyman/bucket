      "title": "Motor Intention Drives Corticospinal Facilitation during Interception Planning",
      "content": "Intercepting a moving target requires integrating visual motion information with motor preparation, yet how action intention and gaze strategy jointly shape corticospinal excitability during interception planning remains unclear. We applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex to probe corticospinal excitability while participants either prepared to intercept a moving target or passively viewed its motion. Targets moved at one of two speeds, and participants judged target speed relative to a reference after each trial. Across blocks, participants were instructed to either smoothly pursue the target or fixate their eyes on the interception zone. Motor-evoked potentials were elicited at baseline, after task instruction, early during target motion, or shortly before target arrival. Task goal and gaze strategy interacted to influence both perceptual judgments and corticospinal excitability. Passive viewing led to overestimation of target speed and was associated with sustained suppression of corticospinal excitability, particularly during fixation. In contrast, preparing to intercept produced a robust facilitation of corticospinal excitability immediately before movement onset, regardless of gaze strategy. Smooth pursuit improved perceptual accuracy and reduced interception timing error compared with fixation but did not independently influence corticospinal facilitation. These findings demonstrate that the intention to act is the primary determinant of the transition from corticospinal suppression to facilitation during interception planning, whereas eye movements modulate perceptual estimates and support behavioral performance.",

      "title": "Pupil size reflects moment-to-moment fluctuations in mental imagery, but not (or hardly) individual differences in imagery",
      "content": "Previous research has shown that the eyes' pupils are larger when imaging dark as compared to bright objects or scenes. Based on this, it has been claimed that pupil size is a sensitive marker of mental-imagery vividness. We investigated this claim in three experiments, conducted in two countries (Norway and The Netherlands; Ntotal = 115), in which participants read, listened, or freely imagined stories that evoked a sense of darkness or brightness. In addition, participants rated their imagery vividness after each story, as a measure of moment-to-moment fluctuations in imagery; and their imagery vividness in general, as a measure of individual differences in imagery. Overall, we found that darkness-evoking stories induced larger pupils than brightness-evoking stories, although this effect was highly variable and only statistically reliable for longer (> 1 min) audio stories. Importantly, we consistently found that this pupil-size difference (dark - bright) was largest for vividly imagined stories. Finally, we did not find any relationship between this pupil-size difference and individual differences in general in imagery. We conclude that the strength of pupil-size changes in response to imagined darkness or brightness reflects moment-to-moment fluctuations in imagery vividness within an individual rather than individual differences in imagery vividness as a personal trait.",
