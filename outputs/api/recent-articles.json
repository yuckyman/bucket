      "content": "IntroductionThe accumulation of genomic and brain data opens new opportunities for resource friendly, data driven brain exploration. A key challenge is to develop versatile and accessible strategies that integrate and mine multimodal datasets for novel neuroscientific insights. Here, we optimized an integrated workflow for mapping multigenic evolutionary traits in the human brain across cognitive, cellular, and molecular levels.MethodsAt the input stage, the workflow fuses an evolutionary genetic dataset with searchable synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) databases that are pre clustered into concise psychological domains for improved interpretability. At its core, a Genetic Algorithm for Generalized Biclustering (GABi) mines gene sets under evolutionary selection that also show high expression correlation with fMRI networks.ResultsApplying this workflow, we identified evolutionary patterns spanning cognitive traits, brain cell types, and molecular mechanisms. Focusing on socio affective traits, the algorithm highlighted peaks in adaptive selection in networks for social interaction (language) and social concepts (theory of mind) across hominid, early hominin, and anatomically modern human (AMH) ancestry. These traits emerge from a broad spectrum of excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neuronal, as well as non neuronal, cell types. The associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched for cell signaling, synaptic organization, and neuronal morphology.DiscussionTogether, these findings demonstrate an integrated workflow for molecular to systems level exploration of the brain and provide new perspectives on the evolutionary history of human socio affective functions. This approach can be adapted to screen for functional traits in the context of mental disorders or applied to the brains of other phylogenies in a similar manner.",

      "title": "Diagnostically competitive performance of a physiology-informed generative multi-task network for contrast-free CT perfusion",
      "content": "Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment. While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood flow in the brain. However, CTP can be expensive with limited accessibility, and the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic reactions and adverse side effects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall, MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.",
