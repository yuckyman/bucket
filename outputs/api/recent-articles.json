      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "content": "Purpose: To generate a comparative spatial proteomic atlas of the human and mouse retina using a refined highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique called Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX). Methods: We refined the IBEX workflow by integrating an antibody removal option alongside chemical bleaching. This dual strategy enabled removal of the entire antibody complex allowing for the flexible use of antibodies from the same host species across iterative cycles. Spatial proteomic data were crosscorrelated to existing scRNAseq datasets. We also coupled this workflow with super-resolution imaging via deconvolution and applied it to the retina of healthy human, mouse and the Crb1rd8 mouse model. Results: We successfully imaged over 25 protein markers on human and mouse tissue sections, to generate spatial atlases of the major retinal cell populations. Cross-species protein expression was compared to scRNAseq datasets to identify protein and transcript disparities. Super-resolution IBEX delineated the ultrastructural features of the outer limiting membrane (OLM), identifying CD44 as a core structural component tightly co-localised with a highly organised F-actin belt within Muller glial endfeet. Using the Crb1rd8 mouse model, disruption of this complex was spatially associated with rosette formation and OLM structural failure. Conclusion: Spatial proteomic atlases of the human and mouse retina were generated and correlated to transcriptional data, revealing insights into the arrangement of major retinal cell populations and OLM structure.",

      "title": "Explosive shock wave exposure leads to age-accelerated motor and sensory decline in C. elegans",
      "content": "Background: Military and law enforcement personnel are routinely exposed to shock waves from weapon systems and explosive devices during training and operations. Even when such shock wave exposure results in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) without abnormalities on routine imaging, persistent neurological symptoms may occur. Yet, the biological processes that link an acute blast wave insult to progressive neuronal dysfunction remain poorly defined. Methods: We established Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes as a genetically accessible animal model for blast-related mTBI (br-mTBI). Animals were exposed in gelatin to shock waves generated by a custom-built shock wave generator (SWG), which produces explosive shock waves with an abrupt overpressure peak followed by a negative pressure phase. The resulting pressure-time curves are very similar to the profiles of conventional explosives in free-field setups. To enable mechanistic studies under controlled laboratory conditions, we developed a complementary platform using a medical radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) device. Motor behavior, mechanosensory function, neuronal morphology and cytoskeletal integrity were analyzed during aging. Results: SWG-derived shock waves induced immediate but reversible motor and sensory deficits, followed by an accelerated age-dependent decline in movement and touch sensitivity. The rESWT platform accurately reproduced these phenotypes. Touch receptor neurons showed progressive structural abnormalities, including degeneration, alongside acute PTL-1/Tau mislocalization consistent with cytoskeletal injury. Conclusions: Defined shock wave exposure is sufficient to provoke long-term neuronal functional decline in C. elegans, accompanied by structural deterioration and premature neurodegeneration. This tractable model enables lifelong phenotyping and mechanistic dissection of how an acute shock wave insult progresses to chronic neuronal dysfunction, and provides a scalable platform for identifying molecular and pharmacological modifiers that promote resilience.",

      "title": "Material perception relies on context-dependent active sensing strategies",
      "content": "Material perception is typically studied under passive and highly constrained viewing conditions, thus leaving it unclear whether humans rely on active sampling strategies to resolve perceptual ambiguities. In everyday vision, however, observers naturally move their heads and manipulate objects with their hands to obtain informative cues, thus raising the question of how such exploratory actions contribute to material recognition. We used immersive virtual reality to examine whether viewpoint changes and object manipulations support the discrimination of visually challenging materials, specifically metal versus glass, whose appearances depend strongly on the associated illumination and viewing geometry. On the basis of three experiments, we revealed that observers systematically increased their exploration tendencies when the identity of a material was ambiguous and that this increased movement was associated with higher discrimination accuracy. By independently manipulating head- and hand-based motions, we identified the context-dependent contributions of each modality, revealing that viewpoint changes dominated when multiple objects could be compared simultaneously, whereas object manipulation was more effective when only a single target was available. Moreover, the participants differed in terms of the efficiency of their sampling strategies, and those who employed more informative exploration patterns exhibited both higher accuracy and greater performance gains across different trials. These results demonstrate that material recognition depends on flexible, context-dependent active sensing rather than passive evaluations of static images. Our findings introduce a new framework, according to which material perception emerges from an adaptive perception-action loop, thus highlighting the functional role of exploratory behaviors in complex visual environments.",

      "content": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling is a major driver of post-ischemic neuroinflammation, yet the cell- and isoform-specific roles of the two major IL-1 receptor type 1 agonists, IL-1 and IL-1{beta}, remain incompletely defined in the context of stroke.

Here, we investigated for the first time the specific contribution of microglial-derived IL-1{beta} to acute injury and post-stroke neurorepair after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in male and female mice, through microglial-specific tamoxifen-inducible Cre-loxP-mediated recombination. Deletion of microglial IL-1{beta} improved acute neurological outcome, reduced neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic brain and dampened systemic inflammatory cytokines. These effects were most evident during the acute phase and in female in mice. In contrast, long-term functional recovery was largely unaffected. However, microglial IL-1{beta} deletion differentially regulated post-stroke neurogenesis, enhancing subventricular zone neurogenic responses and ectopic neuroblast migration while limiting hippocampal neurogenesis. Together, these findings identify microglial IL-1{beta} as a key amplifier of early inflammatory injury after stroke, exerting region-specific effects on neurogenic niches, and highlight distinct, non-redundant roles for microglial IL-1 isoforms in ischemic brain injury and repair.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",
