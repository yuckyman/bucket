      "title": "From generative AI to the brain: five takeaways",
      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "A System for Live Sorting of Neuronal Spiking Activity from Large-scale Recordings",
      "content": "Online monitoring and quantification of neural signals has tremendous value both for neurofeedback experiments and for brain-computer interfaces. Unfortunately, established methods of online monitoring primarily involve the use of thresholded neural activity rather than sorted single-neuron spikes. The recent introduction of large-scale, high-density electrophysiology has enabled the recording of activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in both model organisms and human participants. This development highlights the need for a robust and easily implementable system for sorting spikes during data collection for live analyses of neuronal signals. Here, we describe a system for live sorting of neuronal activity (LSS) based on the widely used Kilosort platform. The LSS workflow utilizes an initial period of recorded neural data to identify waveform templates using Kilosort. LSS then interfaces with the SpikeGLX API to retrieve small batches (e.g. 50 ms) of data and for processing online. We measured the similarity of single-neuron activity sorted live by LSS to that sorted offline in neurophysiological recordings from macaque visual cortex using Neuropixels probes. We show that LSS closely replicates the post-stimulus time histograms and visual response tuning curves of single-neurons obtained using offline sorting. Furthermore, we show that decoding neural signals online with LSS consistently outperforms online decoding of thresholded activity, and that LSS can achieve the same performance as that obtained with offline sorting.",

      "title": "The Role of Synchronization of Neural Modules in Pattern Processing inthe Visual System",
      "content": "Key operations in modeling visual processing in living systems are those that process a pattern as a holistic object, for example, in pattern recognition to ensure invariance to translation and rotation. In this article, we describe a neural module we synthesized for moving a pattern along a cortical layer without losing its shape. The module has the form of a three-layer neural network with two types of inhibitory neurons, one of which is a universal prohibition logic element. Modeling showed that such operations can be implemented using the proposed neural module by additionally synchronizing its operation using endogenous pacemakers with a gamma rhythm frequency. The mechanism of such synchronization is similar to the clock sweep mechanism in electronics. We believe we have clearly demonstrated the possible role of gamma-based brain activity as a mechanism for synchronizing computations in living neural networks for the first time. This opens up new possibilities for constructing neuromorphic architectures for real-time visual recognition.",
