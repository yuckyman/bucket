      "title": "The vermian-crest angle: a prediction model for foetal cystic posterior fossa anomalies",
      "content": "BackgroundAccurate categorisation of the upward rotation of the foetal cerebellar vermis continues to pose diagnostic challenges in prenatal medicine. Recently, a new parameter of the posterior fossa (PF), known as the vermian-crest angle (VCA), has been evaluated using three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) and prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the performance of the VCA in categorizing PF anomalies using 3D-US and to determine its level of agreement with MRI.Study designWe conducted a cohort study involving confirmed cases of PF anomalies. We measured the VCA using 3D-US and compared our data with previously published reference values obtained through both 3D-US and MRI. For statistical analysis, we employed univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).ResultsWe identified 53 foetuses at a mean gestational age (GA) of 24.5 (SD 5.45) weeks with Blake\u2019s pouch cyst (BPC) (n =\u202f11), Dandy\u2013Walker malformation (DWM) (n =\u202f9), mega cisterna magna (MCM) (n =\u202f22), and vermian hypoplasia (VH) (n =\u202f11). Compared to published reference values, the VCA was significantly increased in DWMs (mean 130.6\u00b0, SD 16.75\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.01) and BPCs (mean 91.00\u00b0, SD 19.73\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.05). A VCA\u202f>\u202f80.1\u00b0 distinguished BPCs and DWMs from other PF anomalies, while a VCA\u202f>\u202f107\u00b0 differentiated BPCs from DWMs. When comparing subgroups with published MRI data, we found good agreement between 3D-US and MRI (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.71) (95% CI: 0.55\u20130.87).ConclusionThe VCA may be helpful in categorising PF anomalies using 3D-US, particularly BPC and DWM. The good agreement with MRI measurements reinforces the synergy of these tools in the diagnostic work-up.",

      "title": "Adrenergic signals influence proteomic responses in breast cancer cells",
      "content": "IntroductionBreast cancer remains a major health challenge due to its molecular heterogeneity and complex interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Adrenergic signaling, mediated by stress hormones such as noradrenaline, has emerged as a potential regulator of cancer progression, influencing cell proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.MethodsThis study investigates the effects of adrenergic modulation on breast cancer spheroids from basal-like (MDA-MB-231, BT549) and luminal-like (T47D, MCF7) cell lines, using 3D culture systems as a more physiologically relevant model compared to traditional 2D monolayer cultures. The 3D spheroid model better recapitulates the structural complexity of tumors, providing insights into cell\u2013cell and cell-matrix interactions that influence signaling pathways and drug responses.ResultsNoradrenaline treatment significantly reduced spheroid size, invasion capacity, and the expression of EMT-related markers and integrins in MDA-MB-231 cells. These effects were partially reversed by propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Luminal-like spheroids, characterized by low ADRB2 abundance, displayed limited responsiveness to adrenergic modulation. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct subtype-specific responses, with basal-like spheroids showing pronounced alterations in pathways related to proliferation, cytoskeletal dynamics, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metabolism, whereas luminal-like spheroids exhibited minimal changes.DiscussionOur findings reveal heterogeneity in adrenergic receptor signaling across basal-like and luminal-like breast cancer cell lines, and also within the basal-like subgroup. This diversity underscores the complexity of adrenergic signaling in breast cancer and highlights the advantages of 3D culture systems. These results provide valuable insights into the subtype-specific patterns of response to adrenergic signaling that contribute to tumor progression and may inform future studies including evaluation of therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

      "title": "Personalized beta band HD-tACS over the left SMA improves speech and limb movement by modulating prefrontal delta oscillations in neurotypical young adults",
      "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Optimal visual resolution during MS lens wear is achieved when fixating through the clear, central area of the lens. Under these circumstances, objects at 20-50 degrees from fixation are seen through the lenslet-covered region of the carrier which produces a low-pass spatial frequency filtering effect. Here, visual resolution is limited to a few cycles per degree so that any growth control mechanism must rely on low spatial frequency information.",
