However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

Multicenter validation and targeted oversampling of rare refractive subgroups are required, however, before robust clinical implementation of the models.",

Near visual acuity and spectacle independence was higher in the Isopure-HP group. Low incidence of photic phenomena and high patient satisfaction highlight the long-term effectiveness of both mix-and-match strategies.",

      "content": "Conventional computer vision pipelines typically treat low-level enhancement and high-level semantic tasks as isolated processes, focusing on optimizing enhancement for perceptual quality rather than computational utility, neglecting semantic task requirements. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an integrated joint optimization architecture that aligns the objectives of enhancement tasks with the practical needs of semantic tasks. Specifically, the architecture ensures that medical image...",
