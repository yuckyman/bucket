      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
