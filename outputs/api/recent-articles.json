      "title": "Short Excitatory Projections Promote Burst Activity and Modular Functional Organization in Neural Networks",
      "content": "Physical constraints in the brain favor short, distance-dependent connections. However, short-range projections are not merely a compromise imposed by these constraints; they also serve essential functional roles. Here, we explore networks with balanced excitation and inhibition, demonstrating that short excitatory projections fundamentally increase the number of common presynaptic inputs, thereby enhancing the correlations of neural responses. Strengthened recurrent correlations can lead to bursting states, amplifying postsynaptic neuronal activity and supporting signal propagation over long distances within the network. Moreover, even without an explicitly imposed modular structure, short excitatory connections can give rise to functional clustering and support a broad spectrum of modular functions. Therefore, this structural principle provides a mechanistic basis for functional column formation and dynamic burst propagation, suggesting that the brain transforms structural wiring constraints into opportunities for complex computation and distributed processing. These findings pave the way for a deeper understanding of how the brain transforms structural limitations into opportunities for complex computation.",

      "title": "EEG Reveals Robust Within-Person but Unstable Between-Person Neural Encoding of Pain",
      "content": "The perception of pain varies both within and between individuals, even when sensory input remains constant. Understanding how the brain encodes these intra- and interindividual variations is essential for elucidating the neural mechanisms of pain in health and disease. Yet, previous findings have been inconsistent, and their robustness, in terms of both repeatability and replicability, has remained unclear. Here, we used electroencephalography (EEG) in 161 healthy participants to re-investigate the neural correlates of intra- and inter-individual variations in the perception of brief painful stimuli, independent of stimulus intensity. Using Bayesian multivariate multi-model regression, we related pain ratings to evoked (N1, N2, P2) and induced oscillatory responses (alpha, beta, gamma). To assess the robustness of our findings, the experiment was repeated after four weeks in the same participants and replicated in an independent cohort (n = 111). This design allowed us to examine within-person variability at both short (moment-to-moment) and long (day-to-day) timescales. Inter-individual differences in pain were primarily associated with the P2 response, an effect that was repeatable in the same but not replicable in the independent cohort. In contrast, intra-individual variations were explained by a multicomponent EEG pattern that was both repeatable across time and replicable across cohorts. These findings demonstrate that intra- and inter-individual variability in pain is differentially encoded in the human brain and reveal greater robustness of within-person brain-behavior associations. EEG markers may therefore be more suitable for tracking longitudinal changes in pain within individuals than for comparing pain sensitivity across individuals.",

      "title": "A frontal motor circuit for economic decisions and actions",
      "content": "Flexible behaviour requires transforming abstract cognitive representations, such as value preferences, into concrete motor actions. During economic decision-making, individuals evaluate options to guide choices and then transform these choices into specific actions to obtain rewards, yet the neural circuit mechanisms linking abstract choices to spatial actions remain unclear. Here we show that a frontal motor network performs this transformation through dynamic circuit reconfiguration across decision stages. Using a mouse task that temporally dissociates value-guided decisions from spatial action planning, cortex-wide optogenetic perturbations revealed that a specific frontal motor circuit was causally required for both abstract and motor stages of choice. Electrophysiological recordings during abstract decision-making showed that frontal motor neurons encoded option values and economic choices independently of sensorimotor contingencies, and unilateral silencing impaired decisions without spatial bias. During spatial planning, value and spatial signals were integrated to guide action selection, and unilateral silencing produced an ipsilateral bias. A dynamical model captured this transformation, predicting a shift from distributed interhemispheric maintenance of economic choice to lateralized control of actions, which we validated with simultaneous bilateral recordings. These findings demonstrate how frontal motor circuits reconfigure their interactions to convert cognitive decisions into motor actions, providing a circuit-level mechanism for flexible, value-guided behaviour.",

      "title": "Measuring mild cognitive impairment whole-brain electroencephalography phase-amplitude coupling connectivity using polar mutual information",
      "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "Evaluating the effects of regularization and cross-validation parameters on the performance of SVM-based decoding of EEG data",
      "content": "Regularization has been extensively used in multivariate pattern classification (MVPA; decoding) of EEG data to mitigate the risk of overfitting. N-fold cross-validation is also used to mitigate this risk, and it is often combined with averaging across trials to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. However, the impact of different regularization and cross-validation parameters on decoding performance remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of variations in the support vector machine (SVM) regularization parameter (C) and the number of crossfolds (and the number of trials per average) on the performance of SVM-based decoding analyses. To achieve this, we examined the decoding performance in relatively simple binary classification tasks from seven commonly used event-related potential paradigms (N170, mismatch negativity, N2pc, P3b, N400, lateralized readiness potential, and error-related negativity). Additionally, we evaluated the decoding performance in more challenging multiclass tasks, including decoding face identity, facial expression, stimulus location, and stimulus orientation. The results revealed that both decoding accuracy and effect size were highest when the regularization strength was equal to or greater than 1. Furthermore, using between 3 and 5 folds with at least 10 trials per average yielded optimal decoding performance in most cases. Researchers applying SVM-based decoding to datasets similar to those examined here-in terms of population, recording systems, class numbers, and paradigms-might benefit from using the parameters that we found to be optimal here.",

      "title": "Intrinsic persistent firing in CA1 encodes elapsed time across behaviorally relevant scales",
      "content": "The ability to encode and maintain temporal relationships is crucial for learning, predicting, and forming episodic memories. While hippocampal time cells and entorhinal temporal context cells are well-established in vivo, it remains unclear whether single neurons can sustain representations of elapsed time over multi-second intervals, independent of synaptic drive. Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rodent hippocampal CA1 slices under synaptic blockade, we show that following a brief current pulse, many neurons exhibit exponentially decaying firing rates with a broad distribution of time constants extending to tens of seconds. This indicates that single neurons possess intrinsic mechanisms capable of covering behaviorally relevant temporal scales. These results highlight that single neurons can encode temporal information over more than an order of magnitude, providing a potential cellular substrate for temporal coding in the brain.",

      "title": "Systematic comparison of color representations between humans and deep neural networks: towards predicting human color perception in a vast color space",
      "content": "The representational structure of human color perception, particularly within vast color spaces, remains incompletely understood. While representational structures for dozens of colors have been studied, exploring structures spanning hundreds or thousands of colors has been infeasible due to the time costs of psychophysical experiments. Given these constraints, deep neural networks (DNNs) have attracted attention as a promising tool for providing proxies or predictions of human perception beyond the scope of psychophysical experiments. However, it remains unclear which DNN models possess internal representations that geometrically align with human color perception. Furthermore, it is unclear which learning paradigm enables DNNs to acquire a color representation that is geometrically aligned with that of humans. Here, we systematically investigate which learning paradigm enables DNNs to produce a color representation that is structurally congruent with that of humans, with a focus on three types: self-supervised learning (SSL) that trains on images alone, supervised learning (SL) that trains on images with category labels, and contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) that trains on image-text pairs. We compared internal representations of DNNs with the human similarity judgments of 93 colors using a rigorous unsupervised method termed Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (GWOT), which reveals whether the representational structures of humans and models align at the fine-item level. Our results show that only the CLIP paradigm acquires color representations that strongly align with human data at the fine-item level. Furthermore, when we leveraged a key advantage of DNNs and investigated a substantial representational structure of 4096 colors, the human-aligned CLIP models consistently converged on a non-trivial distorted ring-like structure, which presents a plausible prediction for the large-scale human color representation. Our work demonstrates an approach for exploring unknown territories of human perception through the use of computational models validated in a limited empirical space, and provides predictions for future large-scale psychophysical experiments.",
