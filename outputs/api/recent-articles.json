      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Does spatialized audio enhance the creation of mental representations?",
      "content": "Navigating unfamiliar environments without vision is a considerable challenge for blind individuals, as it requires constructing accurate cognitive maps. Binaural audio feedback, which delivers spatialized auditory cues, has been proposed as a means of enhancing spatial navigation by leveraging the auditory system's natural ability to localize sounds in three dimensions. This study investigated whether binaural audio feedback offers measurable advantages over non-spatialized feedback in supporting spatial perception and mental representation. Fourteen participants, seven blind individuals and seven blindfolded sighted individuals, explored controlled environments under both feedback conditions and reconstructed the layouts using LEGO models. Performance was evaluated through spatial correlation analysis and distance accuracy measures. Results revealed no significant differences between binaural and non-spatialized conditions for either group. These findings indicate that spatialization of descriptive audio alone may not be sufficient to enhance spatial representations, suggesting that factors such as prior training, task design, and integration with other sensory cues may be critical for unlocking the full potential of binaural audio in assistive navigation.",
