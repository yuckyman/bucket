      "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

      "title": "Individuals with aphasia generate larger adaptive and corrective responses to suddenly introduced auditory perturbations",
      "content": "IntroductionPersons with aphasia (PWA) experience changes to feedback and feedforward speech motor control, though the impact on these subsystems has not yet been explored using different perturbation schedules. Here, we examine the magnitude of auditory-motor adaptive and corrective responses together in PWA using gradually and suddenly applied perturbation schedules.MethodsNine PWA and 12 neurotypical adults of similar age to the PWA (NT) completed gradual and sudden altered auditory feedback (AAF) paradigms to measure adaptive and corrective responses to formant perturbation (formants of/\u03b5/shifted toward formants of/\u00e6/). As a measure of the feedforward system, we calculated adaptive responses using the formant changes in the first 100 ms of production. As a measure of the feedback system, we calculated corrective responses based on the differences between the later portion of the production (200\u2013300 ms) and the early portion of the vowel (0\u2013100 ms). Our analyses revealed significant interactions between group and perturbation schedule.ResultsAdaptive and corrective responses of PWA were more similar to those of the NT group in the sudden perturbation schedule. Single-case comparisons of each PWA to the NT group identified different impairment patterns in adaptive and corrective responses during gradual and sudden AAF paradigms within PWA.DiscussionThese findings suggest that measuring adaptive and corrective responses using an adaptation paradigm in PWA is both viable and informative, as the PWA exhibited different impairments in adaptive and corrective responses across the two perturbation schedules. Outcome differences in response to sudden versus gradual perturbations for the PWA may be explained by difficulties with the detection of auditory errors during speech. Perhaps a sudden perturbation schedule improves the adaptive and corrective abilities of PWA by increasing their agency over their speech errors. More studies are needed to further elucidate the critical mechanisms of auditory-motor adaptive and corrective responses in PWA.",

      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide. The design and complete source-code of the stimulator are freely available online in a public repository: https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXstim",

      "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
      "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",

      "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
      "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

      "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I'm making this post to share a package I've been working on for a while: <a href=\"https://github.com/100nm/python-injection\"><code>python-injection</code></a>. I already wrote a post about it a few months ago, but since I've made significant improvements, I think it's worth writing a new one with more details and some examples to get you interested in trying it out.</p> <p>For context, when I truly understood the value of dependency injection a few years ago, I really wanted to use it in almost all of my projects. The problem you encounter pretty quickly is that it's really complicated to know where to instantiate dependencies with the right sub-dependencies, and how to manage their lifecycles. You might also want to vary dependencies based on an execution profile. In short, all these little things may seem trivial, but if you've ever tried to manage them without a package, you've probably realized it was a nightmare.</p> <p>I started by looking at existing popular packages to handle this problem, but honestly none of them convinced me. Either they weren't simple enough for my taste, or they required way too much configuration. That's why I started writing my own DI package.</p> <p>I've been developing it alone for about 2 years now, and today I feel it has reached a very satisfying state.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Here are the main features of <code>python-injection</code>: - DI based on type annotation analysis - Dependency registration with decorators - 4 types of lifetimes (transient, singleton, constant, and scoped) - A scoped dependency can be constructed with a context manager - Async support (also works in a fully sync environment) - Ability to swap certain dependencies based on a profile - Dependencies are instantiated when you need them - Supports Python 3.12 and higher</p> <p>To elaborate a bit, I put a lot of effort into making the package API easy and accessible for any developer.</p> <p>The only drawback I can find is that you need to remember to import the Python scripts where the decorators are used.</p> <h2>Syntax Examples</h2> <p>Here are some syntax examples you'll find in my package.</p> <p>Register a transient: ```python from injection import injectable</p> <p>@injectable class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Register a singleton: ```python from injection import singleton</p> <p>@singleton class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Register a constant: ```python from injection import set_constant</p> <p>@dataclass(frozen=True) class Settings: api_key: str</p> <p>settings = set_constant(Settings(&quot;&lt;secret_api_key&gt;&quot;)) ```</p> <p>Register an async dependency: ```python from injection import injectable</p> <p>class AsyncDependency: ...</p> <p>@injectable async def async_dependency_recipe() -&gt; AsyncDependency: # async stuff return AsyncDependency() ```</p> <p>Register an implementation of an abstract class: ```python from injection import injectable</p> <p>class AbstractDependency(ABC): ...</p> <p>@injectable(on=AbstractDependency) class Dependency(AbstractDependency): ... ```</p> <p>Open a custom scope:</p> <ul> <li>I recommend using a <code>StrEnum</code> for your scope names.</li> <li>There's also an async version: <code>adefine_scope</code>. ```python from injection import define_scope</li> </ul> <p>def some_function(): with define_scope(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;): # do things inside scope ... ```</p> <p>Open a custom scope with bindings: ```python from injection import MappedScope</p> <p>type Locale = str</p> <p>@dataclass(frozen=True) class Bindings: locale: Locale</p> <pre><code>scope = MappedScope(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;) </code></pre> <p>def some_function(): with Bindings(&quot;fr_FR&quot;).scope.define(): # do things inside scope ... ```</p> <p>Register a scoped dependency: ```python from injection import scoped</p> <p>@scoped(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;) class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Register a scoped dependency with a context manager: ```python from collections.abc import Iterator from injection import scoped</p> <p>class Dependency: def open(self): ... def close(self): ...</p> <p>@scoped(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;) def dependency_recipe() -&gt; Iterator[Dependency]: dependency = Dependency() dependency.open() try: yield dependency finally: dependency.close() ```</p> <p>Register a dependency in a profile:</p> <ul> <li>Like scopes, I recommend a <code>StrEnum</code> to store your profile names. ```python from injection import mod</li> </ul> <p>@mod(&quot;&lt;profile_name&gt;&quot;).injectable class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Load a profile: ```python from injection.loaders import load_profile</p> <p>def main(): load_profile(&quot;&lt;profile_name&gt;&quot;) # do stuff ```</p> <p>Inject dependencies into a function: ```python from injection import inject</p> <p>@inject def some_function(dependency: Dependency): # do stuff ...</p> <p>some_function() # &lt;- call function without arguments ```</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>It's made for Python developers who never want to deal with dependency injection headaches again. I'm currently using it in my projects, so I think it's production-ready.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>It's much simpler to get started with than most competitors, requires virtually no configuration, and isn't very invasive (if you want to get rid of it, you just need to remove the decorators and your code remains reusable).</p> <p>I'd love to read your feedback on it so I can improve it.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for reading my post.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/100nm/python-injection\">https://github.com/100nm/python-injection</a> PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/python-injection\">https://pypi.org/project/python-injection</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Skearways\"> /u/Skearways </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pc77j2/i_spent_2_years_building_a_deadsimple_dependency/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pc77j2/i_spent_2_years_building_a_deadsimple_dependency/\">[comments]</a></span>",
