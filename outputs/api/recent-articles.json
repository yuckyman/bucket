      "title": "Estimating the Mean: Behavioral and Neural Correlates of Summary Representations for Time Intervals",
      "content": "Our behavior is guided by the statistical regularities in the environment. Prior research on temporal context effects has highlighted the dynamic processes through which humans adapt to the environment's temporal regularities. Whereas earlier approaches have focused on the adaptation to traces of previous individual events, real-world performance often requires extracting and retaining summary statistics (e.g., the mean) of temporal distributions. To investigate these summary representations for temporal distributions and to test their sensitivity to distributional changes, we explicitly asked participants to extract the mean of different distributions of time intervals, which shared the same mean but varied in their variability specifically operationalized by the width and presentation frequency of the intervals. Our findings showed that the variability of the estimated mean increased with the distributions' variability, even though the actual mean remained constant. We further examined how such learning of temporal distributions modulates EEG signals during subsequent temporal judgments. An analysis revealed that the contingent negative variation, predictive of single-trial RTs, was correlated with how much individuals' estimates of the mean were affected by the distributions' variability. Conversely, the postinterval P2 was not modulated by the distributions but predicted participants' responses, suggesting that P2 reflects the perceived duration of an interval. Taken together, our results demonstrate not only that humans can accurately estimate the mean of a temporal distribution but also that the representation of the mean becomes more uncertain as the variability of the distribution increases, as reflected neurally in the preparation-related contingent negative variation during temporal decisions.",

      "title": "The Role of Syntactic and Semantic Cues in Preventing Temporary Illusions of Plausibility",
      "content": "Unexpected words within a context elicit large N400 brain potentials. However, sometimes the N400 at an unexpected word is small when stereotypical agent and patient roles are reversed, such as at \u201carrested\u201d in \u201cthe cop that the thief arrested.\u201d In a study of 74 native German speakers, we demonstrate evidence that readers can avoid this so-called N400 semantic illusion if the verb is delayed with neutral information such as \u201cthat evening,\u201d but are less able to do so if the delay contains cues that could further strengthen the canonical interpretation, such as \u201cwith handcuffs.\u201d In doing so, we provide a conceptual replication of a relatively new finding and extend previous research by showing that the semantic content of the delay is important. Moreover, we demonstrate evidence that the effect of only the neutral delay increases as the experiment progresses. We propose an interpretation of these findings with reference to the Sentence Gestalt model [Rabovsky, M., Hansen, S. S., & McClelland, J. L. Modelling the N400 brain potential as change in a probabilistic representation of meaning. Nature Human Behaviour, 2, 693, 2018], which accounts for the initial illusion as resulting from uncertainty and an erroneous interpretation based on a strong semantic attractor. Two additional, novel contributions of the work are a demonstration that the illusion can be elicited in German, despite its explicit subject\u2013object case marking, and an exploration of illusion effect among individual readers.",

      "title": "Do Corollary Discharges Contain Information About the Volume of Inner Speech? An ERP Study",
      "content": "When we move our articulator organs to produce overt speech, the brain generates a corollary discharge that acts to suppress the neural and perceptual responses to our speech sounds. Recent research shows that inner speech\u2014the silent production of words in one's mind\u2014is accompanied by a corollary discharge that contains information about the timing and content of inner speech. The aim of the present study was to determine whether this corollary discharge contains information about the volume of inner speech. To investigate this, participants watched an animation that provided them with precise knowledge about when they should produce a \u201cloud\u201d or \u201cquiet\u201d inner sound. At the same time, they heard an audible sound that was either similar or dissimilar to the volume of the inner sound. We found that producing the inner sound attenuated the N1\u2014an ERP signature of auditory processing\u2014and enhanced the slow negative wave\u2014an ERP signature of anticipation and motor preparation\u2014compared with listening, regardless of whether the volume of the inner sound was similar or dissimilar to the audible sound. We also found that the volume of the inner sound did not differentially modulate the N1 or slow negative wave. We speculate that this might be because one of the functions of corollary discharge is to protect our auditory receptors from desensitization caused by audible sounds, and this might be redundant in the context of inner speech because inner speech does not produce an audible sound. We conclude that there might be a functional difference between the neural processes that underlie the production of inner and overt speech.",

      "content": "Contralateral delay activity (CDA) is a measure used to assess the amount of information being stored in visual working memory (VWM). However, it has also been suggested that CDA reflects the current focus of spatial attention, as seen in the multiple object tracking task. This study aimed to determine whether the CDA observed in the multiple object tracking task is driven by VWM storage demands, potentially stemming from the feature (cue) masking of target features. To test this, we manipulated whether participants needed to remember the tracked items under masked or unmasked conditions during the tracking phase. Our experiment revealed that CDA occurred in both conditions; the amplitude of CDA was sensitive to the tracking load only in the masked condition. These findings suggest that CDA reflects both sustained attentional activation and representational storage, with the tracking load influencing CDA only when storage in VWM is required. These results support the conclusion that CDA is primarily sensitive to VWM storage rather than the current focus of spatial attention.",

      "content": "This study investigates the role of theta frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) in enhancing the consolidation of newly acquired semantic knowledge. Although postencoding theta oscillatory power increase has been reported to benefit episodic memory consolidation, its influence on semantic memory retention has not been examined. In this experiment, 175 participants were taught fundamental immunology concepts and were then randomly assigned to receive either theta or beta tACS, applied through midline frontal, left parietal, or bilateral parietal montages, or sham stimulation as a passive control condition. Memory for that newly acquired knowledge was assessed before and shortly after the intervention, 24 hr later, and 1 week later, to evaluate both acute and longer-lasting effects of the stimulation. Results indicated that theta tACS significantly enhanced memory consolidation compared with both sham and beta conditions, especially when applied using a parietal montage targeting the area of the left angular gyrus. The resulting improved performance was consistent across all stages of assessment, indicating a robust effect of postencoding theta stimulation on the persistence of semantic memory. This suggests that some processes and substrates of early memory consolidation are common to episodic and semantic memories. These findings hold practical implications for educational and therapeutic contexts, suggesting that theta tACS might be used to reinforce learning, in both healthy and memory-challenged individuals.",

      "content": "Homologous ion channels are expressed in sensory neurons across species where they shape responses to varied sensory stimuli, on a wide range of timescales. In grasshoppers, visual detection of looming stimuli which simulate an approaching predator involves the sub-cellular expression pattern of a newly characterized Shaker channel in a single identified neuron, discovered using a newly sequenced genome and single cell RNA sequencing. This channel shapes selectivity for approaching threats and was characterized with electrophysiological recordings, RNA interference, pharmacology and biophysical compartmental simulations. Our results explain how a slowly activating and inactivating potassium conductance common in neuronal dendrites contributes to visual object segmentation and implements a complex neural computation within a single neuron.",

      "title": "Exploring Brain State Changes Through Reaction Time in a Simultaneity Judgment Task: A Pilot Study on Multisensory Integration",
      "content": "Problem statement: Multisensory Integration (MSI), the brains ability to merge information from different sensory modalities, relies on the Temporal Binding Window (TBW)-the interval during which stimuli are most likely to be perceived as simultaneous. Beyond its role in perception, MSI may also reflect changes in brain state as task difficulty evolves. In this pilot study, we aimed to explore whether behavioral metrics, particularly reaction time (RT), can capture these brain state changes during a Simultaneity Judgment (SJ) task. Understanding this relationship is critical for developing adaptive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that rely on real-time cognitive and perceptual feedback. Approach: To assess how temporal alignment influences both perception and underlying brain state, we employed a Two-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) SJ task using audiovisual stimuli. After estimating individual simultaneity thresholds, we implemented an adaptive task that gradually increased difficulty by manipulating the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) closer to the TBW. We hypothesized that as perceptual uncertainty increased, RTs would reflect evolving cognitive states, serving as an observable indicator of underlying neural activity shifts. Materials and Methods: Two participants were tested with consistent auditory (500 Hz tone) and visual (faded white circle) stimuli. The TE phase used a staircase procedure to determine personalized TBWs. In the subsequent adaptive test phase, SOAs were progressively modulated around these thresholds to induce varying levels of perceptual ambiguity. Behavioral responses were analyzed using psychometric curve fitting, confusion matrices, and detailed RT evolution across trials. Results and Discussion: Participant 1 showed clear RT modulation near the TBW, suggesting heightened cognitive load and decision uncertainty - a potential signature of brain state transitions. In contrast, Participant 2 exhibited less sensitivity, possibly due to suboptimal thresholding. These preliminary findings suggest that RT holds promise as a behavioral correlate of perceptual state; however, further refinement and standardization of the task are needed before it can be reliably scaled to larger and more controlled studies of MSI-linked brain dynamics.",

      "content": "Understanding the molecular composition of the brain at cellular level is essential for deciphering the metabolic alterations associated with brain diseases. Furthermore, the different prevalence of some neurological diseases between males and fe-males highlight the importance of incorporating gender factor in such studies. Here, we demonstrate that using imaging mass spectrometry in negative polarity it is possible to isolate and characterize the lipidome of specific neuronal populations in the mouse brain, including the locus coeruleus (LC), mesencephalic neurons and the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Neuronal identity was validated through immunofluorescence on adjacent serial sections. Comparative analysis revealed that each neuronal population presents a distinct and well-defined lipidic profile, with differences extending across all lipid classes analyzed. Regarding sex-based differences, we found discrete differences in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine-ether, phosphatidylinositol and sphingomyelin LC neurons. Lipidomic differences were more pronounced in mesencephalic neurons, whereas no significant sex-defendant differences were observed in SNc lipid composition. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies aimed at identifying lipid metabolic dysregulations in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Using the complete electron-microscopy connectome of the adult male Drosophila ventral nerve cord (MANC v1.2.1), we charted every axo-axonic input onto the 1,314 descending neurons that carry brain commands to the body. Only 1.0 % of the 861,591 possible Descending-Descending neuron pairs form such contacts, but when present, synaptic weight grows linearly with partner number regardless of transmitter identity. High-degree neurons integrate the network without forming a rich-club core. Large-scale simulations singled out an octet of ascending neurons (AN08B098) whose axo-axonic input to the Giant Fiber descending neurons (DNp01) predicted modulation of escape control. Immunostaining confirms their cholinergic identity, while optogenetic activation confirmed that this excitatory cohort increases Giant Fiber excitability, validating connectome-derived rules. Our work delivers the first map of axo-axonic wiring and constraints for models of fast motor control.",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
