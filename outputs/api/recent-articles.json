      "title": "Dormant viral pathways underlie space-induced neural senescence: a neuroprotective strategy for spaceflight and neurological diseases",
      "content": "Long duration spaceflight is associated with neurological symptoms in astronauts, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using human brain organoids cultured aboard the International Space Station, we analyzed three independent spaceflights to demonstrate that exposure to the space environment triggers Space Induced Neural Senescence (SINS), characterized by chromatin remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of viral-like transcriptional programs in the absence of infection. Multiomics analyses identified upregulation of endogenous LINE-1 (L1) retroelements, whose activity was markedly enhanced in organoids lacking MECP2, a known L1 repressor implicated in Rett syndrome. The resulting accumulation of cytoplasmic L1 DNA elicited an IL6 mediated inflammatory and neurotoxic response, which was reversed by reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTi) such as lamivudine or stavudine. Parallel preclinical experiments in Mecp2-deficient mice confirmed that RTi treatment restored neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis, function, cognition, and survival. These findings reveal that the space environment reactivates dormant genomic retroelements, providing an unexpected mechanistic insight into astronaut neurobiology and identifying a potential therapeutic strategy for both space-induced and terrestrial neurological conditions. Our pioneering study demonstrates the value of space-enabling research in accelerating drug discovery and the treatment of diseases on Earth.",

      "title": "Network modularity reveals context and state-dependent reorganization of time-varying functional connectivity in single-cell resolved neural activity recordings",
      "content": "An important goal of neuroscience is to understand how biological neural networks organize activity at multiple scales to enable complex information processing and behavioral output. To address this challenge, large-scale neural activity datasets with increased resolution and wider coverage have become more prevalent across many model systems. However, bridging the gap in scale between changes in pairwise functional connectivity between neurons and changes in brain-wide organization of activity remains a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate application of modularity-based community detection and network modularity to single-cell resolved recordings, for the first time, as a method to summarize complex changes in time-varying functional connectivity, facilitating comparisons across multiple time windows, recordings, and conditions. We apply these methods to both single-cell resolved multi-cell and whole-brain activity recordings. In the multi-cell recordings, we find that food odor changes functional connectivity between existing network modules in a C. elegans locomotory interneuron network, rather than reorganizing them. In spontaneous whole-brain activity, we identify several key hub neurons and combinations that significantly destabilize module assignments when silenced. Together, these results demonstrate community detection and modularity as a method for detecting context and network state-dependent changes in functional connectivity at the intermediate scale of network modules in single-cell resolved neural activity. Results from these analyses facilitate future investigation of mechanisms that mediate organization of neural activity at intermediate scales.",

      "title": "Accessing Meaning During Encoding Shapes Subsequent Memory Reactivation in the Brain",
      "content": "Semantic access can occur in many forms, ranging from retrieving specific exemplars to linking concepts with related meanings. We hypothesized that accessing meaning at different levels during encoding would lead to distinct neural reactivation patterns during later memory retrieval. Human participants learned novel word-image associations through prompts that queried item-specific, categorical, or thematic features, while undergoing fMRI. Multivariate pattern analysis shows that encoding histories leave distinct neural signatures even when behavioral performances is equivalent. Encoding history could be decoded by classifiers from recognition activity across the ventral visual stream and higher-order regions. Category-based encoding reduced item-specific reinstatement in perceptual regions, while item-based encoding modified cross-phase item-level similarity in the anterior temporal lobe, suggesting a transition from detailed to integrative conceptual representations. Together, these findings demonstrate that semantic access during encoding shapes how memories are neurally reinstated to integrate perceptual and conceptual information across systems supporting semantic and episodic memory.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

The absence of association with other traditional risk factors may reflect underlying genetic differences or distinct gene-environment interactions. As DNA samples were collected, further investigation incorporating genetic data is warranted to better understand ARMD susceptibility in this population.",

      "content": "Due to their utility in replacing workers in tasks unsuitable for humans, unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have become increasingly common tools in the fish farming industry. However, earlier studies and anecdotal evidence from farmers imply that farmed fish tend to move away from and avoid intrusive objects such as vehicles that are deployed and operated inside net pens. Such responses could imply a discomfort associated with the intrusive objects, which, in turn, can lead to stress and...",
