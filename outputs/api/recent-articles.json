      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "YCB-Handovers Dataset: Analyzing Object Weight Impact on Human Handovers to Adapt Robotic Handover Motion",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20847v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper introduces the YCB-Handovers dataset, capturing motion data of 2771 human-human handovers with varying object weights. The dataset aims to bridge a gap in human-robot collaboration research, providing insights into the impact of object weight in human handovers and readiness cues for intuitive robotic motion planning. The underlying dataset for object recognition and tracking is the YCB (Yale-CMU-Berkeley) dataset, which is an established standard dataset used in algorithms for robotic manipulation, including grasping and carrying objects. The YCB-Handovers dataset incorporates human motion patterns in handovers, making it applicable for data-driven, human-inspired models aimed at weight-sensitive motion planning and adaptive robotic behaviors. This dataset covers an extensive range of weights, allowing for a more robust study of handover behavior and weight variation. Some objects also require careful handovers, highlighting contrasts with standard handovers. We also provide a detailed analysis of the object's weight impact on the human reaching motion in these handovers.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.20714v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Generative AI enables personalized computer science education at scale, yet questions remain about whether such personalization supports or undermines learning. This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation. The evidence supports generative AI as a mechanism for precision scaffolding when embedded in audit-ready workflows that preserve productive struggle while scaling personalized support.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.20679v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The 2024 U.S. Presidential Election unfolded within an information environment of unprecedented volatility, challenging citizens to navigate a torrent of rapidly evolving, often contradictory information while determining what to believe. This study investigates the cognitive mechanisms underlying epistemic self-efficacy - the perceived ability to distinguish accurate news from misinformation - across different information channels during this high-stakes election cycle. Drawing on data from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (Wave 155, September 2024, N = 9,360), we test three hypotheses: (H1) whether reliance on social media predicts lower epistemic self-efficacy compared to mainstream news sources; (H2) whether perceived exposure to inaccurate information mediates this relationship; and (H3) whether information fatigue moderates the cognitive burden of verification across platforms. Contrary to expectations rooted in algorithmic filtering theory, we find no significant differences in reported difficulty determining truth between social media and mainstream news users. Instead, epistemic burden is driven by demographics (age, education) and universal information fatigue, suggesting a \"leveling\" of the information landscape during periods of extreme volatility. This finding challenges platform-deterministic theories and suggests that interventions to support informed citizenship must address cognitive resilience and attention management rather than platform choice alone.",

      "title": "Learning Factors in AI-Augmented Education: A Comparative Study of Middle and High School Students",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.21246v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The increasing integration of AI tools in education has led prior research to explore their impact on learning processes. Nevertheless, most existing studies focus on higher education and conventional instructional contexts, leaving open questions about how key learning factors are related in AI-mediated learning environments and how these relationships may vary across different age groups. Addressing these gaps, our work investigates whether four critical learning factors, experience, clarity, comfort, and motivation, maintain coherent interrelationships in AI-augmented educational settings, and how the structure of these relationships differs between middle and high school students. The study was conducted in authentic classroom contexts where students interacted with AI tools as part of programming learning activities to collect data on the four learning factors and students' perceptions. Using a multimethod quantitative analysis, which combined correlation analysis and text mining, we revealed markedly different dimensional structures between the two age groups. Middle school students exhibit strong positive correlations across all dimensions, indicating holistic evaluation patterns whereby positive perceptions in one dimension generalise to others. In contrast, high school students show weak or near-zero correlations between key dimensions, suggesting a more differentiated evaluation process in which dimensions are assessed independently. These findings reveal that perception dimensions actively mediate AI-augmented learning and that the developmental stage moderates their interdependencies. This work establishes a foundation for the development of AI integration strategies that respond to learners' developmental levels and account for age-specific dimensional structures in student-AI interactions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.21105v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) represent a novel but underexplored modality for emotion recognition. This paper presents a systematic evidence synthesis and exploratory investigation of VOC-based affective computing using low-cost sensors. Study 1, a systematic scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, analyzed 16 studies from 610 records across breath, sweat, skin, and urine biosources. Evidence indicates that stress and affective states are reflected in VOC signatures (aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids, sulfur compounds), though with considerable heterogeneity. Current research relies predominantly on laboratory-grade GC-MS or PTR-MS, while wearable sensors provide pattern-level outputs without compound-specific identification - a critical gap for practical systems. Study 2 (n=25) investigated whether low-cost TVOC sensors (BME688, ENS160) combined with physiological monitoring (HR, HRV, GSR) can detect laboratory-induced stress. Exploratory analysis revealed that high cardiovascular reactors exhibited elevated TVOC during arithmetic stress (d=1.38), though requiring replication in larger samples. Substantial interindividual variability emerged (CV>80%), with coupling patterns moderated by baseline emission levels and temporal lags of 30-80 seconds. Random Forest-based multimodal classification achieved 77.3% accuracy (5-fold CV). SHAP analysis indicated VOC sensors contributed 24.9% of model performance. Leave-one-subject-out validation yielded 65.3% accuracy, highlighting the need for individual calibration. This work provides three contributions: (1) comprehensive mapping of VOC biomarker evidence and technological gaps, (2) initial demonstration that low-cost sensors can capture stress-related VOC patterns in multimodal fusion, and (3) identification of key implementation challenges. Findings require replication in larger samples (n>=50).",

      "title": "When LLMs fall short in Deductive Coding: Model Comparison and Human AI Collaboration Workflow Design",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.21041v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With generative artificial intelligence driving the growth of dialogic data in education, automated coding is a promising direction for learning analytics to improve efficiency. This surge highlights the need to understand the nuances of student-AI interactions, especially those rare yet crucial. However, automated coding may struggle to capture these rare codes due to imbalanced data, while human coding remains time-consuming and labour-intensive. The current study examined the potential of large language models (LLMs) to approximate or replace humans in deductive, theory-driven coding, while also exploring how human-AI collaboration might support such coding tasks at scale. We compared the coding performance of small transformer classifiers (e.g., BERT) and LLMs in two datasets, with particular attention to imbalanced head-tail distributions in dialogue codes. Our results showed that LLMs did not outperform BERT-based models and exhibited systematic errors and biases in deductive coding tasks. We designed and evaluated a human-AI collaborative workflow that improved coding efficiency while maintaining coding reliability. Our findings reveal both the limitations of LLMs -- especially their difficulties with semantic similarity and theoretical interpretations and the indispensable role of human judgment -- while demonstrating the practical promise of human-AI collaborative workflows for coding.",
