      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "Response of accommodation and vergence systems to low dose atropine",
      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Atropine (0.05%) use disrupted accommodation significantly over 10 days and increased convergence at near. While near heterophoria shifted towards esophoria, participants' ability to counteract this was also diminished by a reduction in NFV. This suggests that the near heterophoria and fusional reserves of children using 0.05% atropine for myopia control should be monitored closely.",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy may improve schisis cavity volume in XLRS, with a tolerable safety profile observed in a small number of studies. However, the relatively low single-surgery success rate for XLRS-RD highlights the complex anatomy in these eyes. These findings should be considered when assessing anatomic outcomes from novel therapies that require PPV, including subretinal gene therapy.",

For example, high-pitched (vs low-pitched) sounds are commonly associated with elevated (vs low) positions in space, and rounded (vs angular) shapes tend to be linked to the term 'Bouba' (vs 'Kiki'). There is still some debate about the role of immediate sensory experience versus conceptual colour understanding in crossmodal correspondences. In...",

Edible berries of blackcurrant (BC) and its extracted anthocyanins (BCAs) have beneficial effects on human eyes. However, the effect of BCAs on the perception of moving objects and other dynamic visual patterns remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether BCAs improve visual movement perception in aging mice. The aging mice were fed either a standard diet or a standard diet containing BC....",

While recent large-scale vision models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP offer potential, SAM is trained on natural images, lacking medical domain knowledge, and its decoder struggles with accurate tumor segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose the Medical SAM-Clip Grafting...",
