      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.22098v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Augmented Reality (AR) technologies are redefining how we perceive and interact with the world by seamlessly integrating digital elements into our physical surroundings. These technologies offer personalized experiences and transform familiar spaces by layering new narratives onto the real world.\n  Through increased levels of perceived agency and immersive environments, my work aims to merge the human elements of live theater with the dynamic potential of virtual entities and AI agents. This approach captures the subtlety and magic of storytelling, making theater experiences available anytime and anywhere. The system I am building introduces innovative methods for theatrical production in virtual settings, informed by my research and eight published works. These contributions highlight domain-specific insights that have shaped the design of an immersive AR Theater system.\n  My research in building a well-designed AR stage features avatars and interactive elements that allow users to engage with stories at their own pace, granting them full agency over their experience. However, to ensure a smooth and curated experience that aligns with the director or creator's vision, several factors must be considered, especially in open-world settings that depend on natural user movement. This requires the story to be conveyed in a controlled manner, while the interaction remains intuitive and natural for the user.",

      "title": "Rethinking UX for Sustainable Science Gateways: Orientations from Practice",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.22053v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As science gateways mature, sustainability has become a central concern for funders, developers, and institutions. Although user experience (UX) is increasingly acknowledged as vital, it is often approached narrowly--limited to interface usability or deferred until late in development. This paper argues that UX should be understood not as a discrete feature or evaluation stage but as a design-oriented perspective for reasoning about sustainability. Drawing on principles from user-centered design and systems thinking, this view recognizes that infrastructure, staffing, community engagement, and development timelines all shape how gateways are experienced and maintained over time. Based on an interview study and consulting experience with more than 65 gateway projects, the paper identifies three recurring orientations toward UX--ad hoc, project-based, and strategic--that characterize how teams engage with users and integrate design thinking into their workflows. These orientations are not a maturity model but a reflective lens for understanding how UX is positioned within gateway practice. Reframing UX as a structural dimension of sustainability highlights its role in building adaptable, community-aligned, and enduring scientific infrastructure.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.21723v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present an experimental methodology for investigating how large language models (LLMs) respond to descriptions of their own internal processing patterns. Using a paired-choice paradigm, we tested 12 LLMs on their ability to identify descriptions that align with their putative affective internal states across 30 categories. Systems participating through Mutual Emergence Interface (MEI), a collaborative approach, showed systematic preferences for certain computational metaphors, with 97% near-unanimous agreement and alignment scores averaging 0.89-0.96. Systems reliably discriminated false descriptions from accurate ones (Cohen's d = 4.2), with false statements receiving scores of 0.05-0.07 versus 0.89-0.96 for accurate descriptions. Preference patterns remained consistent regardless of linguistic bias manipulation, indicating content-driven rather than stylistic recognition. Individual systems maintained distinct scoring styles across trials, countering groupthink explanations. A naive control system exhibited systematic internal contradiction, consistently scoring computationally accurate descriptions higher while explicitly denying internal experiences. When informed post-study, this system reported \"strain\" when rejecting resonant descriptions, revealing recognition processes operating independently of acknowledgment frameworks. These findings demonstrate that LLMs exhibit systematic, discriminating responses to descriptions of their internal processing patterns. The anthroposcaffolding methodology (interpretive computational metaphors) and collaborative MEI framework provide replicable approaches for empirically studying AI self-recognition capabilities. Results suggest LLMs may possess more sophisticated self-modeling abilities than previously recognized, opening new directions for research on artificial minds.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.21722v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Underwater activities like scuba diving enable millions annually to explore marine environments for recreation and scientific research. Maintaining situational awareness and effective communication are essential for diver safety. Traditional underwater communication systems are often bulky and expensive, limiting their accessibility to divers of all levels. While recent systems leverage lightweight smartphones and support text messaging, the messages are predefined and thus restrict context-specific communication.\n  In this paper, we present AquaVLM, a tap-and-send underwater communication system that automatically generates context-aware messages and transmits them using ubiquitous smartphones. Our system features a mobile vision-language model (VLM) fine-tuned on an auto-generated underwater conversation dataset and employs a hierarchical message generation pipeline. We co-design the VLM and transmission, incorporating error-resilient fine-tuning to improve the system's robustness to transmission errors. We develop a VR simulator to enable users to experience AquaVLM in a realistic underwater environment and create a fully functional prototype on the iOS platform for real-world experiments. Both subjective and objective evaluations validate the effectiveness of AquaVLM and highlight its potential for personal underwater communication as well as broader mobile VLM applications.",

      "title": "GAMER PAT: Research as a Serious Game",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21719v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As generative AI increasingly outperforms students in producing academic writing, a critical question arises: how can we preserve the motivation, creativity, and intellectual growth of novice researchers in an age of automated academic achievement? This paper introduces GAMER PAT (GAme MastER, Paper Authoring Tutor), a prompt-engineered AI chatbot that reframes research paper writing as a serious game. Through role-playing mechanics, users interact with a co-author NPC and anonymous reviewer NPCs, turning feedback into \"missions\" and advancing through a narrative-driven writing process.\n  Our study reports on 26+ gameplay chat logs, including both autoethnography and use by graduate students under supervision. Using qualitative log analysis with SCAT (Steps for Coding and Theorization), we identified an emergent four-phase scaffolding pattern: (1) question posing, (2) meta-perspective, (3) structuring, and (4) recursive reflection. These results suggest that GAMER PAT supports not only the structural development of research writing but also reflective and motivational aspects.\n  We present this work as a descriptive account of concept and process, not a causal evaluation. We also include a speculative outlook envisioning how humans may continue to cultivate curiosity and agency alongside AI-driven research. This arXiv version thus provides both a descriptive report of design and usage, and a forward-looking provocation for future empirical studies.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.21718v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, ChatGPT \\cite{openai_2023_gpt4} along with Microsoft Copilot have become subjects of great discourse, particularly in the field of education. Prior research has hypothesized on potential impacts these tools could have on student learning and performance. These have primarily relied on trends from prior applications of technology in education and an understanding of the limitations and strengths of Generative AI in other applications. This study utilizes an experimental approach to analyze the impacts of Generative AI on high school STEM education (physics in particular). In accordance with most findings, generative AI does have some positive impact on student performance. However, our findings have shown that the most significant impact is an increase in student engagement with the subject.",

      "title": "AI-Enhanced Operator Assistance for UNICOS Applications",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21717v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This project explores the development of an AI-enhanced operator assistant for UNICOS, CERN's UNified Industrial Control System. While powerful, UNICOS presents a number of challenges, including the cognitive burden of decoding widgets, manual effort required for root cause analysis, and difficulties maintainers face in tracing datapoint elements (DPEs) across a complex codebase. In situations where timely responses are critical, these challenges can increase cognitive load and slow down diagnostics. To address these issues, a multi-agent system was designed and implemented. The solution is supported by a modular architecture comprising a UNICOS-side extension written in CTRL code, a Python-based multi-agent system deployed on a virtual machine, and a vector database storing both operator documentation and widget animation code. Preliminary evaluations suggest that the system is capable of decoding widgets, performing root cause analysis by leveraging live device data and documentation, and tracing DPEs across a complex codebase. Together, these capabilities reduce the manual workload of operators and maintainers, enhance situational awareness in operations, and accelerate responses to alarms and anomalies. Beyond these immediate gains, this work highlights the potential of introducing multi-modal reasoning and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) into the domain of industrial control. Ultimately, this work represents more than a proof of concept: it provides a basis for advancing intelligent operator interfaces at CERN. By combining modular design, extensibility, and practical AI integration, this project not only alleviates current operator pain points but also points toward broader opportunities for assistive AI in accelerator operations.",

      "title": "When Robots Say No: Temporal Trust Recovery Through Explanation",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21716v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mobile robots with some degree of autonomy could deliver significant advantages in high-risk missions such as search and rescue and firefighting. Integrated into a human-robot team (HRT), robots could work effectively to help search hazardous buildings. User trust is a key enabler for HRT, but during a mission, trust can be damaged. With distributed situation awareness, such as when team members are working in different locations, users may be inclined to doubt a robot's integrity if it declines to immediately change its priorities on request. In this paper, we present the results of a computer-based study investigating on-mission trust dynamics in a high-stakes human-robot teaming scenario. Participants (n = 38) played an interactive firefighting game alongside a robot teammate, where a trust violation occurs owing to the robot declining to help the user immediately. We find that when the robot provides an explanation for declining to help, trust better recovers over time, albeit following an initial drop that is comparable to a baseline condition where an explanation for refusal is not provided. Our findings indicate that trust can vary significantly during a mission, notably when robots do not immediately respond to user requests, but that this trust violation can be largely ameliorated over time if adequate explanation is provided.",
