      "title": "Odor-induced Sustained Neural Activity during Memory Encoding",
      "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

      "title": "Incidental Encoding of Objects during Search Is Stronger Than Intentional Memorization due to Increased Recollection Rather Than Familiarity",
      "content": "Most memory is not formed deliberately but as a by-product of natural behavior. These incidental representations, when generated during visual search, can be stronger than intentionally memorized content (search superiority effect). However, it is unknown if the search superiority effect is purely quantitative (stronger memory) or also driven by differences in the degrees of recollection and familiarity, two hallmark processes supporting recognition memory. Here, we use signal detection modeling, introspective judgments, event-related EEG potentials, and eye tracking measures to answer this question. In a preregistered study, 30 participants searched for objects in scenes and intentionally memorized others before completing a surprise recognition memory test. Behavioral data from remember\u2013know judgments and receiver operating characteristics indicate that search targets were more often recollected compared with intentionally memorized objects, whereas the two tasks did not lead to differences in familiarity. Surprisingly, the neural signatures did not fully align with the behavioral findings regarding recollection and familiarity. That is, both search targets and intentionally memorized objects elicited a more positive-going mid-frontal negativity peaking at around 400\u2009msec post stimulus onset (FN400), which is associated with familiarity, as well as a more positive-going parietal late component (LPC), indicative of recollection. Both components showed no differences between tasks, indicating equal contributions of recollection and familiarity to remembering searched and memorized objects. Furthermore, the LPC was, as expected, sensitive to differences between recollected and familiar objects when these were intentionally memorized, but it was not affected by these differences for searched objects. Overall, our findings indicate that search superiority relies predominantly on increased recollection. The fact that established neural markers of recollection (LPC) behaved as anticipated for intentionally memorized objects but carried no predictive power for incidentally memorized objects implies that memories established in more ecologically valid tasks might involve neural processes different from those activated in commonly used settings that are more reductionist.",

      "title": "On the Causal Role of the Right Lateral Prefrontal Cortex in Active Forgetting",
      "content": "Extensive research has demonstrated that people can intentionally forget by inhibiting the retrieval of unwanted memories, a phenomenon known as suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Although neuroimaging studies have linked retrieval suppression to the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), direct evidence for the causal role this region plays in supporting SIF is still lacking. In this registered report, our aim is putting to a strong empirical test such an idea by using cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation in a standard think/no-think procedure. Across two experiments, we will compare the SIF achieved by participants receiving cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the right LPFC\u2014which has been shown to disrupt prefrontally mediated inhibitory control\u2014with those receiving sham stimulation or cathodal stimulation over a control site. In addition, we will examine the lateralization of this effect by comparing stimulation of the right and left LPFC. Our results will provide novel and critical insights into the brain mechanisms of inhibitory control.",

      "title": "Attention Modulates Stimulus Representations in Neural Feature Dimension Maps",
      "content": "Computational theories posit that attention is guided by a combination of spatial maps for individual features that can be dynamically weighted according to task goals. Consistent with this framework, when a stimulus contains several features, attending to one or another feature results in stronger fMRI responses in regions preferring the attended feature. We hypothesized that multivariate activation patterns across feature-responsive cortical regions form spatial \u201cfeature dimension maps,\u201d which combine to guide attentional priority. We tested this prediction by reconstructing spatial maps from fMRI activation patterns across retinotopic regions of visual cortex while participants performed a feature-selective attention task. Participants viewed a peripheral visual stimulus at a random location that always contained moving colored dots. On each trial, participants were precued to report the predominant direction of motion or color of the stimulus or to attend fixation. Stimulus representations in reconstructed maps based on a spatial inverted encoding model were selectively enhanced in color-selective regions when color was attended and in motion-selective regions when motion was attended. Whereas enhancement was localized to the stimulus position in color-selective regions, modulations in motion-selective regions were consistent with a more global enhancement when motion was task relevant. These results suggest feature-selective cortical regions support \u201cneural feature dimension maps\u201d: spatial maps of different visual features that are dynamically reweighted based on task demands to guide visual behavior to the most relevant locations based on important features.",

      "title": "Modeling the Role of the Alpha Rhythm in Attentional Processing during Distractor Suppression",
      "content": "Recent experimental results suggest that alpha oscillations in brain neuroelectrical activity do not merely represent an idling phenomenon but actively participate in attention to suppress distractors and reduce cognitive workload. However, the exact mechanism responsible for this attentional processing is still a matter of research. In this work, we propose a simple mechanism for distractor suppression using a neural mass model of oscillating, interconnected cortical regions, based on alpha oscillations and their interaction with the gamma rhythm. Essentially, the model distinguishes between certain \u201csensory\u201d areas, where stimuli are coded and represented via gamma oscillations, a downstream \u201cdetection\u201d area dedicated to processing these stimuli, and a \u201ccontrol\u201d region that generates the alpha rhythm. Unattended stimuli in a sensory area can be suppressed by simply imposing an alpha rhythm that is out of phase compared with the detection layer. A sensitivity analysis performed on a simple paradigmatic model emphasizes the robustness of the proposed mechanism versus parameter changes. Moreover, a more complex example (concerning spatial attention, where objects are represented through a Gestalt proximity rule) supports the capacity of the mechanism to suppress distractors in multi-unit networks. The model aligns with several experimental results and can be further utilized to investigate cognitive alterations in pathological conditions, such as schizophrenia, characterized by dysfunction in the gamma rhythm.",

      "title": "Representing Visual Objects, Attention, and Load in Human Occipito-temporal and Posterior Parietal Cortices",
      "content": "Stability and adaptability are two essential components of everyday vision, enabling us to maintain an object's identity as we attend to different features under varying task loads. We hypothesize that these two components of vision are supported by the interactions among object, attention, and load representations, and the interplay between the human occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), given its visual representation invariance, and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), an adaptive visual processing center. To test this, human participants performed four tasks on the same stream of colored objects with varying attention (attending to color or shape) and load (1-back or 2-back repetition detection). Although the exact neural mechanisms differ in how object, attention, and load modulate neural responses, by placing them as different factors in the same visual representational space using fMRI pattern decoding, we directly compared their effects on visual responses and interactions. We found significant object, attention, and load representations across OTC and PPC, with a gradual transition from more object-sensitive representations in OTC to more attention- and load-sensitive representations in PPC. Notably, object, attention, and load representations showed significant interactions and generalizations across changes with each other in both OTC and PPC. When objects were held constant, attention and load were represented independently of each other, showing their neural separability. Together, the invariant and adaptive nature of object, attention, and load representations in OTC and PPC provides both stability in visual processing and adaptation to the ever-changing visual input and task demands.",

      "title": "Bilateral Field Advantage of Spatial Attention in Macaque Lateral Prefrontal Cortex",
      "content": "Allocating visual attention to behaviorally relevant stimuli is easier when distractors are in the opposite visual hemifield relative to when they are in the same hemifield. The neural mechanisms underlying this bilateral field advantage remains unclear. We documented this effect in two macaques performing a covert spatial attention task in two different conditions: when the target and distracter were positioned in different hemifields (across condition), and when they were positioned on the top and bottom quadrants within the same visual hemifield (within condition). The animals' behavioral performance at detecting a change in the attended stimulus was higher in the across relative to the within condition. We recorded the responses of lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC, area 8A) neurons in one animal. The proportion of LPFC neurons encoding the allocation of attention was larger in the across relative to the within condition. The latter was accompanied by an increase in the ability of single neurons to discriminate the allocation of attention in the across relative to the within condition. Finally, we used linear classifiers to decode the allocation of attention from the activity of neuronal ensembles and found a similar bilateral field advantage in decoding performance in the across relative to the within condition that generalized to different integration time windows and number of neurons used by the classifier. Our finding provides a neural correlate of the bilateral field advantage reported in behavioral studies of attention and suggest a role of the LPFC circuitry in its origin.",

      "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

      "title": "AKAP1 regulates mitochondrial and synaptic homeostasis to enable neuroprotection and repair in retinal ganglion cell degeneration",
      "content": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve degeneration. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in this neurodegeneration, yet effective targeted therapies remain limited. Here, we identify the mitochondrial scaffold A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1) as a critical regulator of RGC resilience and axon regeneration. AKAP1 expression is diminished in human glaucomatous retinas and experimental glaucoma models, correlating with elevated intraocular pressure, disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, and synaptic instability. Restoration of AKAP1 via adeno-associated virus serotype 2-mediated gene therapy preserves RGC survival, promotes mitochondrial fusion and cristae integrity, enhances ATP production, and mitigates oxidative and apoptotic stress in mouse models of glaucoma and optic nerve injury. Transcriptomic profiling of AKAP1 knockout retinas reveals widespread dysregulation of mitochondrial and synaptic gene networks. Mechanistically, AKAP1 stabilizes synapses by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, modulating calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and synapsin phosphorylation, maintaining synaptophysin expression, and suppressing complement component C1q expression, thereby preventing early synaptic loss in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Moreover, restoring AKAP1 expression facilitates axonal regeneration, preserves the central visual pathway, and maintains visual function. Collectively, these findings establish AKAP1 as a master regulator of mitochondrial and synaptic homeostasis and axonal regeneration and a promising therapeutic target for vision preservation in glaucomatous neurodegeneration.",

      "content": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) caused by dominant loss-of-function mutations in DNM2, encoding the GTPase dynamin-2, impairs motor and sensory function. However, the respective contributions of muscle and nerve pathology, and the therapeutic potential of increasing DNM2 expression, remain unresolved. We evaluated tissue-targeted and systemic approaches to increase DNM2 in a mouse model carrying the common K562E-CMT mutation. Muscle-specific DNM2 overexpression from embryogenesis in Dnm2K562E/+ mice ameliorated desmin and integrin mislocalization, membrane trafficking defects, mitochondrial abnormalities, and fibrosis in skeletal muscle, resulting in improved locomotor performance despite persistent muscle atrophy. Conversely, systemic postnatal AAV delivery of human DNM2 increased DNM2 in muscle but failed to transduce nerves, and paradoxically worsened the muscle pathology, producing centronuclear myopathy-like features. These findings reveal a primary pathogenic impact of DNM2-CMT mutation within skeletal muscle, independent of nerve involvement. Collectively, they underscore that precise DNM2 dosage is critical for neuromuscular homeostasis and reveal a narrow therapeutic window for safe and effective therapeutic intervention. This paradox, in which efforts to compensate for a loss-of-function neuropathy risk inducing a gain-of-function myopathy, highlights the need for tightly controlled modulation of DNM2 activity in future therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Ataxin-2 knockdown is neuroprotective via cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms",
      "content": "Ataxin-2 (Atxn2), a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein, has been implicated in ALS risk, and its silencing represents a promising therapeutic strategy to extend life span and ameliorate symptoms in ALS. Although neuroprotective effects have been shown in several ALS preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying ataxin-2 downregulation neuroprotective effects remain poorly understood. Starting with a global proteomic profiling of the yeast and mouse TDP-43 models, we uncovered that pbp1/ataxin-2 downregulation rewires metabolism to activate alternative cellular pathways for energy production under stress. By combining proteomic profiling insights and functional studies in neural cultures, we further show that ataxin-2 downregulation adjusts metabolism in both cell-autonomous and non cell-autonomous pathways. In neurons, ataxin-2 downregulation activates glycolysis and reductive glutamine carboxylation, while astrocytes provide enhanced support by increasing cholesterol synthesis. Collectively, our data characterize novel cellular pathways to overcome TDP-43 toxicity and establish ataxin-2 as a regulator of adaptive response in brain cells under the conditions of stress.",

      "content": "Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), which embraces central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis, is a well-known but uncommon disorder of the central nervous system. The disease primarily occurs after rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. However, excessive drinking is one of the rare etiologies of ODS. Cases of alcohol-related ODS without documented hyponatremia are rarely reported, and optimal therapeutic approaches remain unclear. We report a patient in his 30\u2019s with a history of heavy drinking who presented with unsteady gait and limb tremor as the main clinical manifestations. The patient consistently denied any history of fluid or electrolyte imbalances and reported a normal-range blood sodium level. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed triangular T2-weighted and FLAIR pontine hyperintensity with a surrounding DWI rim. Finally, the patient recovered completely following corticosteroid treatment. This case shows the possibility that Alcohol-related ODS can occur without electrolyte disturbances and may respond favorably to combined corticosteroid and vitamin B therapy, warranting further investigation in clinical studies. We conducted a literature review of ODS in alcoholic patients and summarized its possible etiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics and treatment options to raise awareness of such disorders.",

      "title": "Individuals with aphasia generate larger adaptive and corrective responses to suddenly introduced auditory perturbations",
      "content": "IntroductionPersons with aphasia (PWA) experience changes to feedback and feedforward speech motor control, though the impact on these subsystems has not yet been explored using different perturbation schedules. Here, we examine the magnitude of auditory-motor adaptive and corrective responses together in PWA using gradually and suddenly applied perturbation schedules.MethodsNine PWA and 12 neurotypical adults of similar age to the PWA (NT) completed gradual and sudden altered auditory feedback (AAF) paradigms to measure adaptive and corrective responses to formant perturbation (formants of/\u03b5/shifted toward formants of/\u00e6/). As a measure of the feedforward system, we calculated adaptive responses using the formant changes in the first 100 ms of production. As a measure of the feedback system, we calculated corrective responses based on the differences between the later portion of the production (200\u2013300 ms) and the early portion of the vowel (0\u2013100 ms). Our analyses revealed significant interactions between group and perturbation schedule.ResultsAdaptive and corrective responses of PWA were more similar to those of the NT group in the sudden perturbation schedule. Single-case comparisons of each PWA to the NT group identified different impairment patterns in adaptive and corrective responses during gradual and sudden AAF paradigms within PWA.DiscussionThese findings suggest that measuring adaptive and corrective responses using an adaptation paradigm in PWA is both viable and informative, as the PWA exhibited different impairments in adaptive and corrective responses across the two perturbation schedules. Outcome differences in response to sudden versus gradual perturbations for the PWA may be explained by difficulties with the detection of auditory errors during speech. Perhaps a sudden perturbation schedule improves the adaptive and corrective abilities of PWA by increasing their agency over their speech errors. More studies are needed to further elucidate the critical mechanisms of auditory-motor adaptive and corrective responses in PWA.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> : Farmore is a comprehensive CLI tool written in Python designed to create full backups of GitHub repositories. While <code>git clone</code> is great for source code, it misses a lot of the project management data. Farmore automates the process of:</p> <ul> <li>Cloning or updating repositories.</li> <li>Exporting Issues (preserving the history of bugs and feature requests).</li> <li>Downloading compiled Releases/binaries.</li> <li>Backing up Wikis. It uses concurrency to handle multiple repositories simultaneously, making it much faster than running a sequential script.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience :</strong> This tool is for developers, data archivists, and &quot;self-hosters&quot; who rely on GitHub but want to ensure they own their data. If you are worried about losing access to your account, or if you just want an offline copy of your project's issues and documentation, this is for you. It is suitable for production use as a daily backup cron job.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> : The main alternative is running a standard <code>git clone --mirror</code>. However, standard Git commands <strong>do not</strong> download Issues, Releases, or Wiki data\u2014they only download the version control history. There are other specific tools that download <em>only</em> issues or <em>only</em> repos, but Farmore aims to be an all-in-one solution that handles the full scope of repository data concurrently. It simplifies the backup process into a single command rather than needing multiple scripts.</p> <p><strong>Source Code</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/miztizm/farmore\">https://github.com/miztizm/farmore</a></p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback on the structure or if there are other data points I should add to the backup process!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lanbird\"> /u/lanbird </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p7b7cr/i_made_farmore_a_python_cli_to_backup_github/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p7b7cr/i_made_farmore_a_python_cli_to_backup_github/\">[comments]</a></span>",
