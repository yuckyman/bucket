      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><em>TLDR: Until recently, I did not know about pydantic. I started using it - it is great. Just dropping this here in case anyone else benefits :)</em></p> <p>I maintain a Python program called <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre\"><em>Spectre</em></a>, a program for recording signals from supported software-defined radios. Users create configs describing what data to record, and the program uses those configs to do so. This wasn't simple off the bat - we wanted a solution with...</p> <ul> <li>Parameter safety (Individual parameters in the config have to make sense. For example, <code>X</code> must always be a non-negative integer, or `Y` must be one of some defined options).</li> <li>Relationship safety (Arbitrary relationships between parameters must hold. For example, <code>X</code> must be divisible by some other parameter, <code>Y</code>).</li> <li>Flexibility (The system supports different radios with varying hardware constraints. How do we provide developers the means to impose arbitrary constraints in the configs under the same framework?).</li> <li>Uniformity (Ideally, we'd have a uniform API for users to create any config, and for developers to template them).</li> <li>Explicit (It should be clear where the configurable parameters are used within the program).</li> <li>Shared parameters, different defaults (Different radios share configurable parameters, but require different defaults. If I've got ten different configs, I don't want to maintain ten copies of the same parameter just to update one value!).</li> <li>Statically typed (Always a bonus!).</li> </ul> <p>Initially, with some difficulty, I made a custom implementation which was servicable but cumbersome. Over the past year, I had a nagging feeling I was reinventing the wheel. I was correct.</p> <p>I recently merged <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/pull/62\">a PR</a> which replaced my custom implementation with one which used pydantic. Enlightenment! It satisfied all the requirements:</p> <ul> <li>We now define a model which templates the config right next to where those configurable parameters are used in the program (see <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/blob/main/src/spectre_core/flowgraphs/_signal_generator.py#L15-L51\">here</a>).</li> <li>Arbitrary relationships between parameters are enforced in the same way for every config with the validator decorator pattern (see <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/blob/main/src/spectre_core/models/_signal_generator.py#L14-L49\">here</a>). </li> <li>We can share pydantic fields between configs, and update the defaults as required using the annotated pattern (see <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre-core/blob/main/src/spectre_core/fields/_fields.py\">here</a>).</li> <li>The same framework is used for templating all the configs in the program, and it's all statically typed!</li> </ul> <p>Anyway, check out <em>Spectre</em> <a href=\"https://github.com/jcfitzpatrick12/spectre\">on GitHub</a> if you're interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jcfitzpatrick12\"> /u/jcfitzpatrick12 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ox9cct/pydantic_and_the_path_to_enlightenment/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ox9cct/pydantic_and_the_path_to_enlightenment/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Comparative Evaluation of Assumption Lean Community Detection Methods for Human Connectome Networks",
      "content": "Community detection provides a principled lens on mesoscale organization in functional brain networks, yet many widely used methods presume assortative structure and depend on arbitrary thresholding, which complicates the selection of the community count K. We conducted a systematic benchmark of three assumption lean approaches that operate directly on weighted functional connectivity matrices: the Weighted Stochastic Block Model, Spectral Clustering, and K-means. Performance was assessed on synthetic networks with known ground truth and on three neuroimaging cohorts spanning development, namely the Human Connectome Project, Washington University 120, and the Baby Connectome Project. We compared strategies for choosing K, including post hoc indices such as silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, C index, modularity, variation of information, Normalized Mutual Information, and zRand, together with a likelihood-based criterion for the Weighted Stochastic Block Model that uses bootstrap confidence intervals for differences in log likelihood between successive values of K. In simulations all methods recovered stable partitions, but the post hoc indices favored incorrect values of K under weak signal and nonassortative mixing. In adult datasets the indices do not yield a unique optimum, whereas the likelihood-based criterion selects a parsimonious range centered near K=11, which is consistent with established sensory and association systems. In infants and toddlers, the same procedure supports a larger K around 15 and reveals developmentally distinct mesoscale architecture, including anterior and posterior subdivisions within default mode and fronto parietal systems. A consensus relabeling scheme based on Hungarian matching with Hamming distance further stabilizes solutions across runs and across values of K. Overall, threshold free weighted methods mitigate assortative bias and the likelihood-based comparison provides a reproducible path to selecting K.",

      "title": "Toward Understanding the Role of Visual Hierarchy in Flicker-induced Time Dilation: A Preregistered Study",
      "content": "When a temporal interval is marked by flickering stimuli, its subjective duration is overestimated. The cortical origin of this temporal illusion, termed flicker-induced time dilation (FITD), is not yet well understood. In this pre-registered study, we aimed to explore whether the higher-level regions of ventral visual stream contribute to FITD. By using the semantic wavelet-induced frequency tagging (SWIFT) technique, four experimental conditions were created. Luminance and semantic flickers were created to selectively target the lower- and higher-level regions of the visual hierarchy, respectively. A combined luminance and semantic flicker condition was additionally created to probe the effect of simultaneous entrainment of lower- and higher-level visual regions on FITD. Lastly, to account for the single-pixel modulations and ripple-like motions induced by SWIFT, a control scramble condition was included. The phase-clustering analysis (N = 20) confirmed that the control scramble condition did not result in neural entrainment, whereas the flicker conditions showed entrainment whose magnitude and topography were consistent with their respective experimental manipulations. Nonetheless, the behavioral results indicated that the time dilation effect was not modulated by the flickering conditions neither was its magnitude correlated with the size of entrained oscillations. Moreover, the SWIFT scrambles led to a time dilation effect which was comparable to the flickering conditions. We discussed that while our results are not in agreement with neural entrainment account of FITD, they are not in agreement with the processing principles definition of salience either. Based on the putative shared cortical sources of SWIFT scrambles and luminance-modulated flickers, we conjectured that FITD, and motion-induced time dilation may rely on the same mechanism based on activation of motion sensitive regions. Finally, our results indicated that, at least at the presence of steadily activated lower-level visual and/or motion sensitive areas, periodic activation of ventral stream does not contribute to FITD.",

      "title": "The DNA methylation enzymatic machinery in substance use disorders: a systematic review",
      "content": "Substance use disorders (SUD) are chronic affections defined by similar symptoms across a variety of psychoactive drugs, including alcohol, cocaine, opioids, or methamphetamine. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation represent key candidates to help explain the long-lasting effect of these drugs, as well as inter-individual variation in vulnerability. Here, we systematically reviewed current knowledge on the role of DNA methylation and the related enzymatic machinery in rodent models of SUD. Using a prospectively registered methodology, 99 articles were prioritized. A first set of studies manipulated the expression or activity of methylation or demethylation pathways. Depending on the brain region or drug considered, SUD-related behavioral and molecular manifestations were bidirectionally modulated, suggesting both pathogenic and protective roles for drug-induced methylomic plasticity. A second set of articles focused on candidate genes. Although significant heterogeneity across experimental models, brain regions or gene targets resulted in an absence of replicated findings, available data nevertheless support the notion that drugs of abuse trigger DNA methylation changes at discrete loci. Third, recent genome-wide studies have started to demonstrate that these drugs recruit widespread reprogramming. Strikingly, most adaptations occur outside promoter regions, highlighting an important challenge toward their functional interpretation. Finally, studies of drug exposure during gestation or adolescence suggest long-lasting consequences, with the potential for early intervention.",
