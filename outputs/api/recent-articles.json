      "title": "SFRP1 drives glycolytic activation in astrocytes during neuroinflammation",
      "content": "Astrocytes and microglia maintain brain homeostasis and respond to inflammation through functions coordinated by molecular mediators they produce. Growing evidence shows that cellular metabolism is key to how these cells adapt to challenges. However, little is known about what drives glial metabolic reprogramming or whether molecules involved in astrocyte microglia crosstalk also regulate this process. Here, we explored this question focusing on Secreted Frizzled-Related Protein 1 (SFRP1). SFRP1 is an astrocyte-derived factor induced by inflammatory cues and overexpressed in neurodegeneration, which fosters microglial response to inflammation through NFkappaB and HIF dependent programs. We combined mitochondrial morphometry (MitoTracker Red and MiNA analysis) with Seahorse extracellular flux assays (Mito Stress Test) to determine whether SFRP1 modulates glial bioenergetics in primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia from wild-type and Sfrp1-/- mice. We report that SFRP1 acts as a driver of astrocytic metabolic activation, preferentially enhancing glycolysis over mitochondrial respiration. This effect is most pronounced during inflammation, when oxidative phosphorylation is restricted and SFRP1 enhances glycolytic flexibility to sustain energy demands. By contrast, microglia showed the expected LPS-driven glycolytic shift with minimal dependence on SFRP1 under monoculture conditions. These findings position SFRP1 as a candidate regulator of astrocyte-centered metabolic tuning during neuroinflammation, with implications for disorders such as Alzheimer s disease, in which SFRP1 is elevated.",

      "title": "Age-related inflammatory changes and perineuronal net dynamics: implications for neurodegenerative disorders.",
      "content": "Background: Healthy aging alone can lead to cognitive decline, decreased brain size, protein aggregation, accumulation of senescent cells and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, age is the primary risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Age-related neuroinflammation, as known as inflammaging, is thought to restrict brain plasticity. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular matrix structures surrounding fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, regulate plasticity and protect neurons from oxidative stress. Given the known impact of inflammaging on neural circuits, this study examines age-associated changes in PNN homeostasis, glial activation, and neuroinflammation in two brain regions relevant to age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: We analyzed young (4-month-old) and aged (22-month-old) C57BL/6J male mice for several behavioral phenotypes [hippocampal-dependent spatial learning using the Barnes maze; locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors using Open field and T-maze]. Using immunostaining, PNNs (Wisteria floribunda agglutinin and aggrecan), PV interneurons, and microglial activation (Iba1) were quantified in both the hippocampus and dorsal striatum. Glial morphology was examined using a battery of cell body, branching, and endpoint analyses. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze changes in the gene expression of inflammatory and extracellular matrix markers. Results: Aged mice exhibited hippocampal-dependent memory deficits without alterations in locomotion or anxiety-related behavior. PNN counts increased in the aged hippocampus, particularly in CA2, with a higher proportion of WFA and aggrecan PNNs. In contrast, PNN homeostasis was maintained in the dorsal striatum. In general, Aged mice showed increases in microglial activation and a subset of inflammatory markers. We report brain region- and age- specific gene expression changes in complement, matrix metalloproteinases, and other inflammatory markers. Aged striatal microglia displayed an activated morphology with larger cell bodies and reduced branching, as well as increased expression of markers for microgliosis (Iba1, TREM2, CD68). Conclusions: These findings suggest that aging differentially affects neuroinflammation and PNN integrity across brain regions. The hippocampus exhibits PNN accumulation, neuroinflammation, and behavioral changes, whereas the striatum maintains PNN homeostasis concurrent with increased microglial activation. This work suggests that neuroinflammation contributes to age-related changes in PNNs and behavior underscoring the importance of region-specific therapeutic strategies targeting PNN regulation.",

      "content": "This paper presents an approach of combining Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) signals to create a hybrid Brain Interface Computer (BCI) device for controlling a hand exoskeleton through classifying the flexion attempt and resting states of the subjects. We analyzed data of 51 healthy and patients with brain lesions that involved the motor cortex and different hand movement disorders. Their EMG and EEG activity were recorded while the subjects attempted to move their index finger. The signals are analyzed through deep neural network, restricted Boltzmann machine and LDA classifier methods to access a reliable accuracy. Further, to evaluate the proposed approach, we designed and implemented a robotic system for rehabilitation of the hand movement to show that it is able to derive assistive control, by detecting flexion movement from the signals as a command and send it to robot. The system is combined with control signals that determine the information of flexion according to measured EMG signals.",

      "title": "Building the blood-brain barrier: a scalable self-assembling 3D model of the brain microvasculature under unidirectional flow",
      "content": "The blood vessels of the central nervous (CNS) system form a tight, protective blood-brain barrier (BBB). This barrier is essential for healthy CNS function but also poses a hurdle in the treatment of increasingly common neurological disorders. Additionally, BBB dysfunction is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, further emphasizing a need for a better understanding of BBB function in health and disease. We present a human self-assembling 3D model of the BBB in a microfluidic cell culture platform that allows culture of 48 models in parallel on one tissue culture plate. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes form highly reproducible BBB vascular networks under unidirectional perfusion and remain viable for a minimum of 14 days. Immunostaining reveals close cell-cell interactions with pericytes and astrocyte end-feet in direct contact with the brain microvasculature. Compared to endothelial monocultures, co-culture with astrocytes or pericytes results in improved barrier function, lower vessel diameters, increased branching, and alignment of the vessels in the direction of fluid flow. These results were most pronounced in tri-cultures containing all three cell types. Unlike similar models previously reported, this brain microvasculature model allows for unidirectional perfusion without the need for pumps and syringes. Combined with its high-throughput nature, this feature renders the model suitable for studies of BBB function in health and disease, and assessment of potential BBB restorative therapies.",

      "title": "Temporal dynamics of neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration in the central auditory system following noise-induced hearing loss: A multimodal imaging and histological study",
      "content": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a sensorineural disorder that triggers profound neuroplastic and neurodegenerative consequences in the central auditory nervous system (CNS). This study examined how neuronal density, axonal integrity and glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission are affected after acute overstimulation in the central inferior colliculus (CIC) and the ventral medial geniculate body of the thalamus (MGV). To achieve this, a correlative multimodal approach combining audiometric, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological biomarkers was performed. Adult mice were noise-exposed to broadband white noise (5-20 kHz) for 3 hours at either high (115 dB SPL) or moderate (90 dB SPL) intensity, while unexposed mice were used as controls. Separate cohorts of mice were investigated 1-, 7-, 56- and 84-days post-exposure using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of gray matter density (GMD), diffusion MRI (dMRI) of microstructure and connectivity, and single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) for glutamate and GABA quantification. Frequency-specific auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded at 4, 8, 16 and 32 kHz before and after exposure to examine hearing threshold (HT) shifts. Following imaging, brains were processed for fluorescence immunohistochemistry (FIHC) targeting Neuronal Nuclear Protein (NeuN), 4',6-diamidino-2-fenilindo (DAPI), Neurofilament (SMI312), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), and vesicular glutamate transporters 1 (VGLUT1) and 2 (VGLUT2). HTs were significantly elevated 7d, 56d and 84d after 115 dB noise exposure, suggesting a NIHL phenotype. Neurofilament density significantly increased in the CIC and MGV 1d after 115 dB noise exposure, and returned to baseline at later time points. dMRI transient microstructural alterations were observed 7d after 90 dB noise exposure. Glutamate and GABA decreases 84d after 90 dB exposure were also detected. Moreover, correlation analysis between audiometric, histological and MRI datasets revealed scarce relationships between the investigated parameters. These findings advance our understanding of the CNS adaptations of NIHL and emphasizes the need for more sensitive and integrative approaches to identify robust biomarkers of central auditory dysfunction.",

      "title": "Discriminative power of diverse nonlinear EEG dynamics across consciousness states during auditory stimulation in disorders of consciousness",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "title": "Aberrant static and dynamic brain functional topological organization in the differentiation of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-seropositive optic neuritis from seronegative optic neuritis",
      "content": "ObjectiveAn early and accurate diagnosis of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody seropositive optic neuritis (MOG-ON) versus seronegative-ON is critical for optimal management. We aimed to explore alterations in static and dynamic functional networks for differentiation by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) with the graph theory method.MethodsRS-fMRI was performed on 53 patients (23 with MOG-ON and 30 with seronegative-ON) and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Graph theory analysis was used to investigate the topological properties of the functional networks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed to determine their effectiveness in differential diagnosis.ResultsWith respect to static properties, the MOG-ON and seronegative-ON groups presented a spectrum of abnormalities in global and nodal properties compared with the HC group. Furthermore, compared with the seronegative-ON group, the MOG-ON group also presented with abnormal properties mostly located in the visual network (VN). With respect to dynamic properties, the MOG-ON and seronegative-ON groups presented with greater variances of global and nodal properties compared with the HC group. Importantly, the variances in several global and nodal properties were greater in the MOG-ON group. Compared with that in HCs, the subnetwork (24 nodes and 28 edges) in the MOG-ON patients was enhanced. For ROC analysis, the optimal diagnostic performance was obtained by combining static and dynamic approaches.ConclusionIn conclusion, abnormal topological organization of static and dynamic brain functional networks may help explore the neural mechanisms of ON in different phenotypes and serve as biomarkers for differentiation.",

      "title": "A review of the application of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of facial paralysis",
      "content": "Facial paralysis (FP), as a highly prevalent neurological dysfunction disease worldwide, has long faced challenges such as strong subjectivity in assessment and difficulty in quantifying therapeutic effects in its clinical diagnosis and treatment. Traditional scales rely on physicians\u2019 experience. Neuroelectrophysiological examinations are invasive, while imaging evaluations are costly. The rise of intelligent sensing technology provides a new path to break through these limitations. Intelligent sensing technology has significantly improved the accuracy of FP recognition and assessment through multi-modal data fusion and dynamic monitoring. Its clinical value is not only reflected in the improvement of diagnostic efficiency, but also in promoting a fundamental change in the diagnosis and treatment model of FP. The artificial intelligence-assisted analysis mainly focuses on using machine learning algorithms to conduct in-depth exploration and analysis of the surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals of patients with facial paralysis, the motion trajectory data obtained through three-dimensional (3D) motion capture, as well as the data from patients\u2019 self-assessment scales. This study systematically reviews the innovative applications of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of FP, focusing on three major technical directions: sEMG, 3D motion capture, and artificial intelligence assisted analysis.",

      "title": "Spike-based time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model for extremely low power VLSI implementation of multi-layer neural networks",
      "content": "In deep neural network (DNN) models, the weighted summation, or multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation, is an essential and heavy calculation task, which leads to high power consumption in current digital processors. The use of analog operation in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits is a promising method for achieving extremely low power-consumption operation for such calculation tasks. In this paper, a time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model is proposed based on an integrate-and-fire-type spiking neuron model. The proposed calculation model is applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with positive and negative weights are separately performed, and two timings proportional to the positive and negative ones are produced, respectively, in each layer. The timings are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction operation. We also propose VLSI circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low power consumption. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS circuit to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights. Simulation results showed that the precision was above 4-bit, and the energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 237.7 Tera Operations Per Second Per Watt (TOPS/W), more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors. Our model promises to be a suitable approach for performing intensive in-memory computing (IMC) of DNNs with moderate precision very energy-efficiently while reducing the cost of analog-digital-converter (ADC) overhead.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",
