      "title": "Distilling the neurophenomenological signatures of pure awareness during Transcendental Meditation",
      "content": "Pure awareness (PA) is described in contemplative traditions as a wakeful state largely devoid of cognitive content, often considered a case of minimal phenomenal experience (MPE). Transcendental Meditation (TM) provides an excellent empirical model for PA because it is standardized, effortless, and reliably induces reports of awareness with minimal content. We combined phenomenological and electrophysiological approaches to study PA in 33 experienced TM practitioners and matched controls (performing mental counting). Using Temporal Experience Tracing, TM practitioners reported greater intensity and variability of PA than controls, regardless of years of meditation practice, consistent with the notion of 'automatic self-transcendence'. Using electroencephalography (EEG) and multivariate classification analyses, our large-scale screening of theoretically motivated EEG markers revealed a double dissociation in neural signatures. When contrasting TM with controls, temporal entropy and aperiodic dynamics were the strongest discriminators, while functional connectivity based on phase coherence contributed the least. In contrast, when TM was compared with its own baseline, low-frequency functional connectivity dominated, while temporal entropy contributed minimally to classification. This dissociation suggests that PA is characterized by enhanced EEG signals' diversity and aperiodic neural dynamics compared to ordinary cognition but stabilized by slow-frequency oscillatory synchronization relative to rest. Finally, TM showed little evidence of carry-over effects from meditation into subsequent rest, in contrast to controls, where counting induced residual changes. Together, these results provide the most systematic electrophysiological characterization of PA to date and establish neurophenomenology as a robust framework for advancing the neuroscience of minimal phenomenal experience.",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
