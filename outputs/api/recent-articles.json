      "title": "Cognitive effects of placebo antipsychotics: Investigating their mechanisms using event-related potentials (ERPs) in a cognitive test and a self-referential task",
      "content": "Placebos modulate neurocognitive processes. We examined whether a fully deceptive antipsychotic-placebo changes cognition not only by enhancing arousal and attention but also by changing self-representations, namely, by adding that of being under a treatment related to psychosis and by weakening the binding of experience to reality. Drug-naive healthy participants (N = 83) were split into a group (N = 40) who took a pill described as an antipsychotic and a no- pill control group (N = 43). Participants performed a cognitive test (CogTest), that is, a semantic categorization task and a self-referential role judgment task (SRT). Behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. In the CogTest, placebos showed faster response times and higher accuracy than no-pills. This cognitive improvement was associated with more negative occipito-temporal early ERPs (OTEEs), larger central P2s (CentP2s), and larger late positive potentials (LPPs), with the latter correlating with response times. As in the literature, CentP2s were maximal in the SRT, possibly because it maximally stimulates the binding of the stimulus to long-term self-representations. The larger CentP2s and LPPs for placebos than for no-pills in the CogTest were thus tentatively related to the binding of the stimulus with egocentric self-representations, temporarily enriched by the addition of the representation of being on drug. On the contrary, the more negative OTEEs were related to a weaker binding to allocentric ones, preventing a strong binding of experience with reality. The smaller N400s observed for placebos than for no-pills in both tasks were related to greater openness to new experiences.",

      "title": "Transcranial focused ultrasound induces source localizable cortical activation in resting state humans when applied concurrently with transcranial electric stimulation",
      "content": "The effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on the human brain are poorly understood. Currently, the field is at odds with whether tFUS is subthreshold modulating the brain's excitability towards other stimuli, producing suprathreshold neural stimulation on its own, or if it even has a spatially specific non-auditory induced affect. Herein, we investigated the ability of tFUS, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and a novel combination of the two (transcranial electro-acoustic stimulation; tEAS) to evoke cortical target-location specific activity in 27 resting state humans with whole brain electroencephalography recordings. In none of the exogenous event related potentials did tFUS or tDCS result in location-specific activations. However, the co-modulatory combination of tEAS did, providing evidence that tFUS has a location-specific subthreshold modulatory effect. We propose a minimally modified Hodgkin Huxley model that explains our results and provides a unifying framework for the field-wide observed effects (or lack thereof) of tFUS.",

      "title": "Examining excitation-inhibition modulation during social processing using functional Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy",
      "content": "An imbalance of brain excitation-inhibition has been implicated in social communication function across neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. Recent advances in functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) allow non-invasive measurement of dynamic changes in excitation-inhibition neurometabolites (glutamate and GABA), revealing potential links with cognitive processes. This study used functional MRS (fMRS) to investigate whether socially-laden stimuli modulate excitatory or inhibitory neurometabolites, and whether modulation relates to social function. Forty neurotypical adults (18-40 years; 20 male) underwent 3T MRI, with fMRS data acquired using a J-difference edited MRS sequence. GABA+macromolecules (GABA+) and glutamate+glutamine (Glx) were quantified in a right social brain region (superior temporal/temporoparietal junction [STG/TPJ]) and a control region (occipital cortex). Participants viewed a fixation cross (rest; 5 min), silent video clips of social interaction, and a flashing checkerboard as control stimulus (5 min each; counterbalanced). The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2) assessed social function. There were no significant differences between resting and functional (social or checkerboard) GABA+ or Glx levels (ps<.05), although Bayesian analyses showed evidence for decreased STG/TPJ GABA+ and increased occipital cortex Glx for checkerboard compared to rest. Higher SRS-2 scores were associated with higher resting STG/TPJ Glx but not GABA+, and functional metabolite levels were not associated with SRS-2 scores (ps>.1). Sliding time window analyses suggest reduced Glx in social brain during social and visual stimulation. Despite sound data collection and analysis techniques, shifts in Glx and GABA+ following social stimuli were minimal. Future research could utilise more challenging social stimuli and examine alternate social brain regions.",

      "title": "Region-specific associations between cerebral arterial elasticity and grey matter volume: Evidence for lateral prefrontal vulnerability",
      "content": "Background: Ageing is associated with increased cardiovascular health risks and disproportionate atrophy in frontotemporal brain. Regional cerebral arterial elasticity correlates with regional grey matter volume, with stronger associations frontally and in older adults. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is linked to preserved brain structure and greater arterial elasticity, while sex differences exist in the timing of vascular versus structural changes. This study examines whether regional cerebral arterial elasticity in frontotemporal cortex mediates the association between age and corresponding grey matter volume decline, and whether sex and/or CRF moderate this relationship. Methods: We analysed data from 162 healthy adults (60-70 years) with structural MRI and diffuse optical tomography of the cerebral arterial pulse (Pulse-DOT) from the ACTIVate cohort. CRF was estimated from demographic and physiological measures. Pulse Relaxation Function (PReFx), an optical index of regional arterial elasticity, was measured across 28 frontal, temporal, and parietal regions of interest (ROI). Grey matter (GM) volume was quantified for corresponding ROIs. Mediation and moderated mediation models tested whether PReFx mediated the relationship between age and GM volume at bilateral frontal and temporal ROIs, and whether biological sex or CRF moderated this relationship. Results: Regional bivariate correlations identified associations between age, PReFx and GM volume across multiple ROIs, which PReFx and GM volume being associated primarily in left frontal and temporal areas. PReFx partially mediated the effect of age on GM volume in a left mid-inferior frontal ROI, accounting for approximately 16% of the total age effect and this relationship was only evident in females. Although higher CRF was associated with greater PReFx, it did not moderate the relationship between age, PReFx and GM volume. Conclusions: Consistent with cascade models of neurovascular aging, cerebral arterial stiffening was found to partially explain the effect of increasing age on frontal GM volume, even in this highly age-restricted and high functioning cohort. This effect was only significant over the left prefrontal cortex, consistent with greater vulnerability of frontal brain and associated cognitive functions. It was also exclusively present in females, who had better cardiovascular health, larger grey matter volume and greater arterial elasticity than males. These findings are consistent with pulse-DOT measures of cerebral arterial elasticity being more sensitive to subclinical brain structural variability.",

      "title": "Visual Semantic Encoding and Identification of Naturalistic Movies via High-Density Diffuse Optical Tomography",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain represents meaning in real-world contexts is essential for both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Brain encoding and decoding models from naturalistic stimuli provide a powerful window into semantic representations. Yet, existing approaches rely on a constrained scanning environment, or on conventional fNIRS, which has been limited to sparse sampling and/or block-design paradigms. Here, we tested whether high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), an advanced high-density tomographic optical imaging method, can support semantic encoding and decoding using naturalistic movies. We collected 3.5 hours of naturalistic movie viewing data from six participants using stimuli labeled with 1,708 categories. Encoding models robustly predicted voxel-level responses, yielding single semantic category maps consistent with prior fMRI studies. In complementary decoding analyses, we showed that DOT responses captured sufficient semantic content to identify which clips participants viewed. To assess organization across individuals, we identified a shared low-dimensional semantic space that captures common semantic dimensions. Finally, clustering analyses revealed interpretable higher-order semantic dimensions like social and animate agents, objects vs natural organisms, and textural scenes, consistently mapped across the cortex. These findings demonstrate that DOT can recover distributed, high-dimensional semantic representations from naturalistic movies, bridging fMRI-level semantic mapping with the accessibility of optical imaging.",

      "title": "Brain-AI Alignment in Naturalistic Movies",
      "content": "Naturalistic paradigms offer a powerful window into human cognition, but it remains difficult to link rich, continuous movie content to distributed brain activity in an interpretable way. In this study, I use a multimodal large language model (Gemini) as an automated \"semantic annotator\" to bridge naturalistic movie stimuli, brain responses, and cognitive performance. Using the Human Connectome Project movie-watching dataset, I segmented the film into 293 overlapping clips, prompted Gemini to rate each clip on 11 psychologically interpretable dimensions, and simultaneously extracted clip-wise BOLD activation patterns from the fMRI images in 360 cortical parcels. In this way, the AI and the brain effectively \"watch\" the same movies in parallel. For each parcel, I then fit linear regression models to predict clip-to-clip variation in movie-evoked responses from these features. Gemini-derived features robustly predicted movie-evoked responses in temporal, medial parietal, and lateral frontal association cortex, but explained little variance in unimodal somatosensory, dorsal parietal, insular, and piriform regions. Feature-weight maps recapitulated known functional specializations, and features with the largest global influence overlapped with the most explainable parcels. Partial least squares analysis revealed that individual differences in resting-state connectivity strength and semantic explainability covaried along an asymmetric intrinsic axis: strongly integrated sensory-opercular systems at rest were associated with poorer AI predictability, whereas a smaller set of dorsal and medial association regions showed enhanced alignment. Finally, regional AI explainability in medial parietal and left perisylvian association areas was positively related to fluid and crystallized cognitive abilities. Together, these findings demonstrate that prompt-defined, interpretable features from foundation models provide a simple and scalable framework for quantifying brain-AI alignment in naturalistic settings, offering a practical bridge between biological and artificial semantic representations.",

      "title": "Genetic Background and Sex Modulate Androgen Responses in Human Brain Microphysiological System",
      "content": "Sex steroids shape human brain development, yet the cellular and molecular consequences of androgen addition need further exploration. Here, we used a human neural organoid model - brain microphysiological system (bMPS), derived from nine induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines to model the impact of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent non-aromatizable androgen. All lines differentiated reproducibly into electrically active, neuron-glia-oligodendrocyte organoids expressing robust androgen-signaling components. DHT was bioavailable, elicited nuclear androgen receptor (AR) translocation and increased organoid size in most cell lines, consistent with androgen-responsive mTOR and metabolic pathway activation. Bulk RNA-seq across nine lines revealed that transcriptional responses varied across donor backgrounds, but DHT-responsive genes converged on mitochondrial energetics, lysosomal function, glycoprotein processing, apoptosis, and mTOR signaling. Cell-type expression profiling showed an androgen-driven shift primarily in male lines toward astrocytic profiles with reductions in oligodendrocyte, oligodendrocyte progenitor (OPC), excitatory, and inhibitory neuronal signatures, supported by immunohistochemistry and AR enrichment in astrocytes and OPCs. DHT also altered neurodevelopmental pathways, increasing variation in synaptic pruning and decreasing variation in neuronal migration, with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis and seizure status of donors moderating these effects more strongly than sex. Baseline transcriptional differences distinguished iPSC lines which responded more strongly to DHT from weak responders: responders displayed enhanced synaptic maturity and reduced ECM gene expression. Using isogenic XX/XY lines, we found that differences in sex-chromosome expression exceeded DHT-induced changes and that DHT decreased expression of inhibitory neuron genes in males and increased it in females. Finally, DHT induced extensive DNA methylation changes, targeting HOX genes, patterning, and synaptic genes. Collectively, these findings reveal that androgen signaling shapes transcription, cell populations, and epigenetic landscapes in a genetic background-dependent manner. This work contributes to understanding how androgens influence human brain development and highlights how in vitro models can contribute to representing inter-individual variability in neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Distinct cellular and transcriptional mechanisms mediate an antioxidant therapeutic response in 22q11-deleted upper layer cortical projection neurons",
      "content": "We characterized cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic response in vitro and in vivo to the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which in the LgDel 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome mouse model restores growth and connectivity of upper layer cortical projection neurons (Layer 2/3 PNs) and improves cognitive performance. NAC treatment of primary cultured LgDel L 2/3 PNs does not restore these neurons to a wild type (WT) state. Rather than returning to the bimodal dendrite and axon size distribution seen in WT, LgDel L 2/3 PN dendrite and axon growth in vitro increases unimodally in response to NAC. In parallel, altered expression of 22q11-deleted genes and presumed downstream targets are unchanged. Instead, novel antioxidant defense and neuronal growth genes are differentially expressed: some generally NAC-regulated, others responsive only in the context of 22q11 deletion. Apparently, NAC ameliorates L 2/3 PN developmental pathology without restoring WT cell states or typical expression of mutant genes or their downstream targets. NAC also elicits differential expression of antioxidant defense genes in 22q11-deleted L 2/3 PN - but not L 5/6 counterparts - in the developing postnatal LgDel mouse cortex, rather than modulating 22q11 genes or downstream targets. These NAC-dependent, L 2/3 PN-selective in vivo cellular and transcriptional changes differ substantially from those in primary culture. Thus, despite some in vitro and in vivo parallels, the NAC therapeutic response that diminishes oxidative stress-related L 2/3 PN circuit and behavioral pathology due to 22q11 deletion has a unique in vivo signature.",

      "title": "Striatal ensembles specify and control granular forelimb actions",
      "content": "The ability of the brain to control specific fine actions is crucial for survival. The striatum is a critical brain center for both movement and learning, and its dysfunction underlies numerous movement disorders. Whereas activity in the striatum has been classically viewed as invigorating and reinforcing movements, recent studies suggest that striatal activity encodes specific movements. However, it is not known how granular this activity is, and if it indeed controls specific ongoing movements. We designed a task where mice performed two minimally-different forelimb actions, consisting of a push or pull isometric force on an immobile joystick, and imaged the activity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsolateral striatum using 2-photon microscopy. We observed that striatal activity encoded both the preparation and execution of specific actions, even when those actions were not reinforced. Furthermore, both populations of D1 and D2-MSNs - classically viewed as promoting versus inhibiting movement - equally encoded action identity. We developed a closed-loop system to model and stimulate action-specific neural ensembles deep in the brain, using holographic optogenetics through a GRIN lens. Stimulation of action-specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs increased the force of ongoing actions, but only when the ensemble stimulated was congruent with the ongoing action. These results reveal that specific ensembles of both D1- and D2-MSNs causally control specific ongoing actions, as granular as different muscle co-contractions of the same forelimb. Such granularity provides a mechanistic framework for understanding how striatal dysfunction can produce highly specific movement impairments in Huntington's disease and dystonia.",

      "title": "Characterising longitudinal dynamics of infant neurodevelopment using functional change point detection",
      "content": "Habituation is an early-developing cognitive process linked to early learning whereby irrelevant stimuli are filtered out; it can be assessed using neuroimaging tools, including functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, conventional fNIRS analysis approaches typically assume linear time invariance and analyse summary statistics of the data, potentially limiting insight into the nature of the changing evoked haemodynamic response. Functional data analysis (FDA) is a branch of statistics which treats entire mathematical functions as the unit of analysis rather than discrete points; within this framework, functional change point (FCPt) detection can identify significant changes in data structure, such as the mean haemodynamic response function. Using infant fNIRS data from a rural Gambian population (n= 204) recorded using a habituation and novelty detection paradigm, the use of functional change point detection with wild binary segmentation was implemented to identify structural changes in the evoked haemodynamic response. Group-level analysis from participants assessed at 5-, 8- and 12mo of age identified structural change corresponding to the evoked haemodynamic response in locations consistent with previous analyses. Further analyses indicated consistent habituation at 8- and 12mo and an age-related shift in the timing of decreasing haemodynamic responses, suggesting older infants in the first year of life habituate more rapidly to auditory stimuli. These results provide novel evidence to support the use of FDA and FCPt detection in the fNIRS field more widely, as well as improving understanding of the development of habituation during early infancy.",

It is designed for those who need strict type safety and architectural flexibility (e.g., swapping validation rules without rewriting core logic).</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Vs. Standard Wrappers:</strong> Most AI tutorials just send <code>file.read()</code> to an API. PyAPU includes a <strong>Security Layer</strong> (input sanitization, regex-based injection detection) and a <strong>Plugin System</strong> to handle production concerns like Pydantic validation and cost tracking.</li> <li><strong>Vs. LangChain/LlamaIndex:</strong> Those are massive, general-purpose frameworks. PyAPU is a lightweight, purpose-built library solely for <strong>document-to-struct</strong> conversion.

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "content": "We propose a protocol to detect and track cognitive drift caused by algorithmic curation. We confirm that the protocol is interpretable, sensitive, reproducible, and portable across domains. It is especially suited to cognitive and neurocognitive research. We build a Cognitive Drift Index (CDI), confirm its three dimensions, and use a small calibration run to set reasonable ranges. We then map CDI to governance action bands. Using health short videos as a case, we estimate path effects with a weighted least squares ANOVA and test robustness. The steps lead to the same pattern, which supports the protocol\u2019s design and practical use. We show each component alongside the composite and sort totals into action bands so practitioners and responsible-AI teams can choose proportionate actions. We also consider using the method, as a conceptual tool, with eye-tracking or EEG to enable multimodal validation.",

      "title": "Social isolation: an integrated molecular web that disrupts cellular homeostasis",
      "content": "Social isolation and perceived loneliness are increasingly recognized as serious public health concerns, with extensive evidence linking them to adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Defined, respectively, as the objective lack of social interactions and the subjective feeling of insufficient connection, both conditions are present across various age groups and are associated with elevated risks of cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders. Epidemiological studies have also identified a strong association between chronic social isolation and the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), potentially mediated by dysregulated stress responses, immune function, and endocrine signaling. Animal models of social deprivation have proven instrumental in elucidating the biological underpinnings of these effects, revealing disruptions in neurotransmitter systems and in the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis, with important downstream metabolic alterations. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking social isolation to MetS and CVD, with a focus on oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impaired autophagy. A deeper understanding of these pathways is essential to guide the development of targeted interventions and to reduce the long-term health burden associated with social disconnection.",
