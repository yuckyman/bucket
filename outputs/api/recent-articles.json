      "title": "An integrated virtual reality platform for naturalistic neuroimaging with magnetoencephalography",
      "content": "Studying the brain in motion promises deep insights into the neural circuits that support complex, real-world behaviour. In humans, wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) enable magnetoencephalography (MEG) with millisecond temporal resolution and millimetre spatial precision during movement. Integrating this technology with virtual reality (VR) could enable fully naturalistic experimental paradigms, but magnetic interference from existing head-mounted displays (HMDs) prevents reliable whole-brain MEG recordings. Here, we present and validate a VR system that integrates with wearable, OPM-based MEG. At its core is a purpose-designed HMD with minimal ferromagnetic material, resulting in magnetic flux density two orders of magnitude lower than consumer-grade alternatives at comparable resolution and weight. Using phantom measurements and established perceptual and cognitive benchmark tasks across participants, we demonstrate robust stimulus-induced neuronal activity at both sensor and source level. Crucially, these sources span the entire brain, including visual, motor and prefrontal cortices, as well as hippocampus. Our proposed VR system is straightforward to produce, readily extendable, and enables whole-brain MEG during immersive, naturalistic behaviours.",

      "title": "Avatar facial expressions enhance social presence and inter-brain synchronization in virtual reality",
      "content": "Virtual reality (VR) has become a prominent medium for computer-mediated social interaction, yet the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning avatar-mediated communication remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how dynamically modulated avatar facial expressions shape interpersonal interaction in VR. Pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative creativity task while interacting via avatars whose facial expressions were either amplified, natural, or expressionless. We collected subjective measures of body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction, while simultaneously recording neural activity using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy-based hyperscanning to assess inter-brain synchrony (IBS). Avatars displaying facial expressions, particularly amplified ones, significantly enhanced body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction compared to expressionless avatars. At the neural level, visible avatar facial expressions were associated with IBS in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), regions that are commonly implicated in social-cognitive processes such as mentalizing and executive control. Although task performance did not differ across conditions, social presence was positively correlated with creative performance, suggesting that psychological connectedness supports collaborative creativity. Together, these findings indicate that avatar facial expressivity functions as a critical nonverbal social cue that facilitates affective and cognitive alignment between interaction partners. By linking subjective experience with inter-brain neural dynamics, this study provides empirical guidance for the design of virtual environments that promote social engagement and effective collaboration.",

      "title": "The schizophrenia associated protein DISC1 is a multivalent tetrameric hub of conserved ancient fold",
      "content": "DISC1 is a pleiotropic protein with essential roles in neuronal proliferation and migration, intracellular signalling and cargo transport. It associates with a diverse array of partner molecules in these contexts. Mutations at the DISC1 locus are strongly associated with a spectrum of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Despite its clinical relevance, the molecular architecture and function of DISC1 have remained largely elusive. We present a cryo-EM structure of the entire conserved core region of DISC1. The structure reveals an intricate homotetrameric assembly that harbours conserved bacteria-derived UVR domains. Four of these domains, one from each monomer, mediate extensive contacts forming two asymmetric dimer units. The dimers in turn interface with each other at two distinct coiled coil domains to achieve a two-fold symmetric tetramer. Mutational analysis shows that this tetrameric architecture enables DISC1 to simultaneously bind multiple copies of NDE1 client protein. Importantly, tetramerization and partner binding are structurally independent functions of DISC1. Altogether, our study provides a compelling molecular model of an ancient bacteria protein fold participating in the assembly of a multivalent mammalian scaffold hub that can coordinate multiple partner molecules.",
