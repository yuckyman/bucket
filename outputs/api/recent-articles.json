      "title": "Contrasting behavioral and physiological effects of Gtf2i duplication and deletion in mouse models of the 7q11.23 Duplication and Williams-Beuren Syndromes",
      "content": "7q11.23 Microduplication Syndrome (7Dup) and Williams-Beuren Syndrome (WBS) are two ASD-related syndromes characterized by both common and contrasting symptoms, caused by either duplication or deletion of a 1.5-1.8 Mb segment in section q11.23 of Human chromosome 7, respectively. Notably, WBS patients show reduced social fear and are considered hyper-social, while 7Dup patients suffer from social anxiety and withdrawal. Previous work suggests that the GTF2I gene, one of the genes included in this segment, has a major role in the social symptoms of both syndromes. Here, we combine video and thermal imaging in multiple social behavior tests to screen for behavioral and physiological variables showing variations in mice models with either a duplication (Gtf2i+/dup) or a deletion (Gtf2i+/del) of the gene. Our analyses of social behavior, micturition, and defecation patterns identify several differences between wild-type and mutant littermates, some of which show contrasting variations associated with Gtf2i dosage. Interestingly, thermal imaging revealed that Gtf2i dosage dictates the mice's surface temperature profile during the tests, with Gtf2i(+/dup) males exhibiting higher surface temperature than their wild-type littermates, while Gtf2i(+/del) males and females show the opposite tendency. These results suggest that the two mouse models exhibit opposite changes in either their emotional state or thermoregulation capabilities, in correlation with Gtf2i dosage.",

      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",
