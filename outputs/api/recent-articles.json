While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

      "title": "Primary stabbing headache in a tertiary headache centre",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION: Primary stabbing headache (PSH) is a short-lasting head pain occurring spontaneously in the absence of underlying structural causes. Although it is a frequent disorder, with a reported lifetime prevalence of 35.2% in the general population, its pathophysiological underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Notably, PSH frequently coexists with other primary headache disorders, particularly migraine, suggesting a possible shared biology.",

Despite increasing popularity, the precise physiological mechanisms underlying its effects remain poorly defined, contributing to inconsistent findings. This review synthesises current evidence for both acute and enduring effects of tDCS across the complete neurovascular unit,...",

These preliminary findings warrant further investigation through large-scale randomized controlled trials to establish efficacy and safety profiles, and to further characterize suicide risk trajectories.",

Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation techniques (NIBS) have entered the recognized guidelines for therapies in psychiatry due to the advantages related to safety and tolerability. The purpose of this review and meta-analysis is to assess if and how NIBS techniques are used and could be effective in the treatment of suicidal ideation.

Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) and core stability exercises have shown promise in enhancing motor control and biomechanical alignment, but their combined effects on DKV remain unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of active versus sham tDCS combined with core stability exercises on knee kinematic alignment...",
