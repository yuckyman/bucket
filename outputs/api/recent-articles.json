      "title": "Connexins are essential for the contribution of latent progenitors to self-repair after spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Gap junctions are important regulators of the biology of neural stem cells. Both in vertebrates with regenerative abilities and neonatal rodents, ependymal cells communicate via connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx26. Gap junction coupling and Cx26 are down-regulated as the ependyma becomes quiescent in adulthood, but injury overrules this developmental down-regulation suggesting a role for Cx signalling in the reactivation of ependymal cells. Here, we aim to explore the role of Cx26 and Cx43 in the response of ependymal cells to injury. We find that Cx26 is critical for the proliferative response to injury and thereby scar formation. Cx43 plays a key role in the communication between ependymal cells of Ca2+ signals induced by activation of P2X7 receptors that trigger downstream events. Our data show that Cxs are relevant targets to manipulate the ependymal stem cell niche to achieve a better self-repair after spinal cord injury.",

      "title": "Bile Acids Regulate Accumbal Cholinergic Circuitry and Dopamine Release through TGR5 Activation",
      "content": "Background: High calorie foods and alcohol produce strong reinforcing effects. Brain mechanisms for these reinforcers have focused largely on indirect mechanisms on mesolimbic circuits. Bile acid secretion is a major factor during caloric intake, however, the role of biliary acids on mesolimbic circuitry remains unexplored. Brain mesolimbic circuits are modulated in part by altering cholinergic interneuron (CIN) activity and tonic dopamine (DA) transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Ethanol and fatty foods also both stimulate hepatic and possibly local brain bile acid (BA) synthesis, which raises the possibility that BAs may act as a common upstream regulator of these substances shared mesolimbic effects. Methods: This study investigated whether BAs can directly alter mesolimbic activity. We collected electrophysiological data from acute mouse brain slices to assess BA effects on accumbal CIN firing and excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic activity. Bile effects on DA release and clearance in the NAc were measured through voltammetry. Results: We found that low concentrations of a 1:1 mixture of BAs cholic acid and deoxycholic acid (1-10 M) increased CIN firing rate whereas high BA concentrations (1-10 mM) decreased CIN firing. We further demonstrated that BA-induced excitatory effects on CIN firing are independently mediated by at least two mechanisms: Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) activation and suppression of inhibitory CIN currents. Additionally, our results indicate that BAs modulate inhibitory input in a complex manner, reducing frequency at low concentrations, but increasing at high concentrations, and increasing amplitude at low concentrations current amplitude, and the distribution of postsynaptic current amplitude sizes across concentrations. Finally, our voltammetry data show that while low BA concentrations enhance NAc DA release without affecting uptake, whereas high concentrations of BA robustly inhibit accumbal DA release. Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence that BAs exert direct modulatory effects on neural activity in the striatum.",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

      "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello!</p> <p>Last year, I started writing a Python C4 model authoring tool, and it has come to a point where I feel good enough to share it with you guys so you can start playing around with it locally and render the C4 model views with PlantUML.</p> <p>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr\">https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr</a></p> <p>Documentation here: <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev/\">https://buildzr.dev</a></p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>buildzr is a <a href=\"https://structurizr.com/\">Structurizr</a> authoring tool for Python programmers. It allows you to declaratively or procedurally author Structurizr models and diagrams.</p> <p>If you're not familiar with Structurizr, it is both an open standard (see <a href=\"https://github.com/structurizr/json\">Structurizr JSON schema</a>) and a <a href=\"https://docs.structurizr.com/usage\">set of tools</a> for building software architecture diagrams as code. Structurizr derives its architecture modeling paradigm based on the <a href=\"https://c4model.com/\">C4 model</a>, the modeling language for describing software architectures and their relationships.</p> <p>In Structurizr, you define architecture models (System Context, Container, Component, and Code) and their relationships first. And then, you can re-use the models to present multiple perspectives, views, and stories about your architecture.</p> <p>buildzr supercharges this workflow with Pythonic syntax sugar and intuitive APIs that make modeling as code more fun and productive.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Use buildzr if you want to have an intuitive and powerful tool for writing C4 architecture models:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Intuitive Pythonic Syntax</strong>: Use Python's context managers (<code>with</code> statements) to create nested structures that naturally mirror your architecture's hierarchy. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/amirulmenjeni/buildzr#quick-example\">example</a>.</li> <li><strong>Programmatic Creation</strong>: Use buildzr's DSL APIs to programmatically create C4 model architecture diagrams. Great for automation!</li> <li><strong>Advanced Styling</strong>: Style elements beyond just tags --- target by direct reference, type, group membership, or custom predicates for fine-grained visual control. Just take a look at <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/styles/\">Styles</a>!</li> <li><strong>Cloud Provider Themes</strong>: Add AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and Oracle Cloud icons to your diagrams with IDE-discoverable constants. No more memorizing tag strings! See <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev/user-guide/themes/\">Themes</a>.</li> <li><strong>Standards Compliant</strong>: Stays true to the <a href=\"https://github.com/structurizr/json\">Structurizr JSON schema</a> standards. buildzr uses <a href=\"https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator\">datamodel-code-generator</a> to automatically generate the low-level representation of the Workspace model.</li> <li><strong>Rich Toolchain</strong>: Uses the familiar Python programming language and its rich toolchains to write software architecture models and diagrams!</li> </ul> <p>Quick example, so you can get the idea (more examples and explanations at <a href=\"https://buildzr.dev\">https://buildzr.dev</a>):</p> <pre><code>from buildzr.dsl import ( Workspace, SoftwareSystem, Person, Container, SystemContextView, ContainerView, desc, Group, StyleElements, ) from buildzr.themes import AWS with Workspace('w') as w: # Define your models (architecture elements and their relationships). with Group(&quot;My Company&quot;) as my_company: u = Person('Web Application User') webapp = SoftwareSystem('Corporate Web App') with webapp: database = Container('database') api = Container('api') api &gt;&gt; (&quot;Reads and writes data from/to&quot;, &quot;http/api&quot;) &gt;&gt; database with Group(&quot;Microsoft&quot;) as microsoft: email_system = SoftwareSystem('Microsoft 365') u &gt;&gt; [ desc(&quot;Reads and writes email using&quot;) &gt;&gt; email_system, desc(&quot;Create work order using&quot;) &gt;&gt; webapp, ] webapp &gt;&gt; &quot;sends notification using&quot; &gt;&gt; email_system # Define the views.

I can\u2019t see how this holds up long-term. My expectation is that you end up with \"spaghetti\" code that works on the happy path but accumulates subtle, hard-to-debug failures over time.<p>When I tried using Codex on my existing codebases, with or without guardrails, half of my time went into fixing the subtle mistakes it made or the duplication it introduced.<p>Last weekend I tried building an iOS app for pet feeding reminders from scratch. I instructed Codex to research and propose an architectural blueprint for SwiftUI first. Then, I worked with it to write a spec describing what should be implemented and how.<p>The first implementation pass was surprisingly good, although it had a number of bugs. Things went downhill fast, however. I spent the rest of my weekend getting Codex to make things work, fix bugs without introducing new ones, and research best practices instead of making stuff up. Although I made it record new guidelines and guardrails as I found them, things didn't improve. In the end I just gave up.<p>I personally can't accept shipping unreviewed code. It feels wrong. The product has to work, but the code must also be high-quality.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46691243\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46691243</a></p>\n<p>Points: 41</p>\n<p># Comments: 32</p>",

      "title": "In sync through laughter? An fNIRS hyperscanning study on neural synchrony and social connection",
      "content": "Laughter is a widespread social behavior that has been associated with increases in social connection. However, the mechanisms behind this link are not yet well understood. We hypothesized that laughter supports positive social outcomes by enhancing neural synchrony during social interactions. Neural synchrony is a process of mutual alignment of brain areas, which has been shown to positively affect social interactions. In a 2 \u00d7 2 design, participant pairs watched either funny or neutral videos (Laughter Manipulation: yes/no), either together or separately (Social Context: yes/no). Afterwards, they engaged in a 10-minute free interaction. Laughter behavior was annotated during both phases. Neural synchrony was measured using fNIRS hyperscanning for both phases and quantified across frontal and temporal regions using Wavelet Transform Coherence. As social outcomes, we measured Liking, Prosociality, and Bonding after the free conversation. We tested our hypotheses with Bayesian models that assessed the effects of Laughter and Social context on social outcomes, with synchrony modeled as a mediator. Parameter estimates for the effects of Laughter and Social Context on interpersonal neural synchrony were close to zero, with Bayes Factors indicating evidence for the null hypothesis. Similarly, the effects of Laughter and Social Context on Liking, Prosociality, and Bonding showed no effects. However, model comparisons provided evidence for annotated Laughter Behavior as a predictor of Liking, Prosociality, and Bonding. Mediation analyses revealed no overall effect, but some findings stood out. We observed a negative association between right IFG and right TPJ synchrony during the manipulation phase and later Liking, and a positive association between right and left IFG synchrony and subsequent Prosociality. Additionally, synchrony during the free interaction phase between the left IFG and right TPJ predicted Liking and synchrony between the left and right TPJ predicted Bonding. In total, our findings show no direct link between Laughter and neural synchrony. However, Laughter Behavior was associated with social outcomes. Additionally, neural synchrony was also linked to social outcomes, with distinct positive and negative associations depending on the brain regions involved. These results highlight the complexity of the relationship between laughter, neural synchrony, and social connection, suggesting the need for further research.",

      "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.
