      "title": "Human-in-the-Loop Optimization of Perceived Realism of Multi-Modal Haptic Rendering Under Conflicting Sensory Cues",
      "content": "During haptic rendering, a visual display and a haptic interface are commonly utilized together to elicit multi-sensory perception of a virtual object, through a combination and integration of force-related and movement-related cues. In this study, we explore visual-haptic cue integration during multi-modal haptic rendering under conflicting cues and propose a systematic means to determine the optimal visual scaling for haptic manipulation that maximizes the perceived realism of spring rendering for a given haptic interface. We show that the parameters affecting visual-haptic congruency can be effectively optimized through a qualitative feedback-based human-in-the-loop (HiL) optimization to ensure a consistently high rating of perceived realism. Accordingly, the multi-modal perception of users can be successfully enhanced by solely modulating the visual feedback without altering the haptic feedback, to make virtual environments feel stiffer or more compliant, significantly extending the range of perceived stiffness levels for a haptic interface. We extend our results to a group of individuals to capture the multi-dimensional psychometric field that characterizes the cumulative effect of feedback modalities utilized during sensory cue integration under conflicts. Our results not only provide reliable estimates of just noticeable difference thresholds for stiffness with and without visual scaling but also capture all the prominent features of sensory cue integration, indicating weights that are proportional to the congruency level of manipulated visual signals. Overall, preference-based HiL optimization excels as a systematic and efficient method of studying multi-modal perception under conflicts.",

      "title": "The Impact of Stimulation Parameters on Reaction Times Following Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation in the Lower Leg",
      "content": "The growing need for human-machine interfaces (HMIs) underscores the importance of sensory feedback, with electrical stimulation offering efficient interaction in various applications. While its sensory effects are extensively studied, investigations into the reaction time (RT) following transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate how stimulation parameters influence RT. We examined RT and RT variability among twenty healthy participants aged 21 to 61 years. Participants underwent 16 stimulation patterns (10 repetitions per pattern) with combinations of four pulse frequencies (4, 26, 48, 70 Hz) and four pulse amplitudes (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 times of sensory threshold) on four skin locations in the lower leg above peroneal nerve, tibial nerve, tibialis anterior muscle, and a lateral shank control site. RT was assessed as participants dorsiflexed their foot in response to electrical stimulation. Results revealed that both RT and its variability decreased as pulse frequency and amplitude increased, and there was an interaction effect between pulse frequency and amplitude. However, no significant difference was found in RT across stimulation locations. These findings demonstrate how stimulation parameters affect the speed and efficiency of communication between the user and the stimulator, showing promises for augmenting real-time feedback HMIs.",

      "title": "A Receive-Only Frequency Translation System With Automatic Phase Correction for Simultaneous Multi-Nuclear MRI/MRS",
      "content": "Objective: Receive-only frequency translation enables MRI scanners with X-nuclear capabilities to perform simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments. Mixing only on the receive side avoids modifying the transmit path, which often has narrow-band components. However, phase incoherence is introduced at the radio frequency mixer due to differing local oscillator frequencies between transmit and receive, necessitating phase correction. This paper presents a hardware solution for automatic phase correction during scans, eliminating the need for retrospective correction and allowing flexible scan parameter adjustments. Methods: The hardware solution detects phase changes in the system LO (local oscillator) between transmit and receive, calculates, and applies phase correction in the translator LO in real time. Programming spare TTL signals and accessing the scanner system LO are required to implement the phase correction method. Results: Phase correction accuracy was evaluated via averaged 31P spectroscopy and 23Na imaging. On top of the noise introduced by the additional mixer, the imperfect phase correction resulted in approximately 3% SNR loss at both frequencies. The corrected 23Na signal exhibited approximately an 8-degree phase standard deviation, compared to 6 degrees in the reference signal. Conclusion: The proposed hardware solution effectively corrects phase incoherence introduced by receive-only frequency translation. While minor imperfection exists, future upgrades are expected to improve the phase correction accuracy. Significance: This approach eliminates the need for retrospective phase correction when using receive-only frequency translation techniques for multi-nuclear acquisition, enabling real-time data acquisition and greater flexibility in scan parameter adjustment for simultaneous/interleaved multi-nuclear experiments.",

      "content": "In multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm), achieving consistent imaging quality across all spectral channels is crucial for accurately identifying a wide range of fluorophores. However, these essential measurements are frequently compromised by saturation artifacts due to the inherently limited dynamic range of detection systems. To address this issue, we present SatCompFLImNet, a deep learning-based network specifically designed to correct saturation artifacts in multispectral FLIm, facilitating high dynamic range applications. Leveraging generative adversarial networks, SatCompFLImNet effectively compensates for saturated fluorescence signals, ensuring accurate lifetime measurements across various levels of saturation. Extensively validated with simulated and real-world data, SatCompFLImNet demonstrates remarkable capability in correcting saturation artifacts, improving signal-to-noise ratios, and maintaining fidelity of lifetime measurements. By enabling reliable fluorescence lifetime measurements under a variety of saturation conditions, SatCompFLImNet paves the way for improved diagnostic tools and a deeper understanding of biological processes, making it a pivotal advancement for research and clinical diagnostics in tissue characterization and disease pathogenesis.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.14576v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Within PCB design, the reuse of circuit design blocks is a major preventing factor inhibiting beginners from reusing designs made by experts, a common practice in software but non-existent in circuit design at large. Despite efforts to improve reusability (e.g. block-based PCB design) by platforms such as SparkFun ALC and Altium Upverter, they lack merging techniques that safely guide users in connecting different circuit blocks without requiring assistance from third-party engineers. In this paper, we propose TypedSchematics, a block-based standalone PCB design tool that supports beginners create their own PCBs by providing a language syntax for typing circuit blocks with circuit data that addresses multiple challenges, from real-time detection of connection errors to automated composition and user-scalable libraries of circuit blocks. Through a user study, we demonstrate TypedSchematics improvements in design support for merging circuit blocks compared to Fusion 360. Three PCBs designed with TypedSchematics further showcase our tool capabilities, one designed by high school students demonstrates the potential of TypedSchematics to significantly lower the PCB design skill-floor.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.14571v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Vision-language (VL) models have shown transformative potential across various critical domains due to their capability to comprehend multi-modal information. However, their performance frequently degrades under distribution shifts, making it crucial to assess and improve robustness against real-world data corruption encountered in practical applications. While advancements in VL benchmark datasets and data augmentation (DA) have contributed to robustness evaluation and improvement, there remain challenges due to a lack of in-depth comprehension of model behavior as well as the need for expertise and iterative efforts to explore data patterns. Given the achievement of visualization in explaining complex models and exploring large-scale data, understanding the impact of various data corruption on VL models aligns naturally with a visual analytics approach. To address these challenges, we introduce VisMoDAl, a visual analytics framework designed to evaluate VL model robustness against various corruption types and identify underperformed samples to guide the development of effective DA strategies. Grounded in the literature review and expert discussions, VisMoDAl supports multi-level analysis, ranging from examining performance under specific corruptions to task-driven inspection of model behavior and corresponding data slice. Unlike conventional works, VisMoDAl enables users to reason about the effects of corruption on VL models, facilitating both model behavior understanding and DA strategy formulation. The utility of our system is demonstrated through case studies and quantitative evaluations focused on corruption robustness in the image captioning task.",

To address this, we present CLEAR framework that structures reasoning into cognitive decision steps-linked units of actions, artifacts, and self-explanations that make decisions traceable. Building on this framework, we introduce ClearFairy, a think-aloud AI assistant for UI design that detects weak explanations, asks lightweight clarifying questions, and infers missing rationales to ease the knowledge-sharing burden. In a study with twelve creative professionals, 85% of ClearFairy's inferred rationales were accepted, increasing strong explanations from 14% to over 83% of decision steps without adding cognitive demand. The captured steps also enhanced generative AI agents in Figma, yielding next-action predictions better aligned with professionals and producing more coherent design outcomes. For future research on human knowledge-grounded creative AI agents, we release a dataset of captured 417 decision steps.",

We pose two key research questions: (i) How does the tech industry conceive of and market \"AI agents\"? (ii) What challenges do end-users face when attempting to use commercial AI agents for their advertised uses? We first performed a systematic review of marketed use cases for 102 commercial AI agents, finding that they fall into three umbrella categories: orchestration, creation, and insight. Next, we conducted a usability assessment where N = 31 participants attempted representative tasks for each of these categories on two popular commercial AI agent tools: Operator and Manus. We found that users were generally impressed with these agents but faced several critical usability challenges ranging from agent capabilities that were misaligned with user mental models to agents lacking the meta-cognitive abilities necessary for effective collaboration.",

While current technology attempts to facilitate remote care, they have limitations and are used in-practice infrequently. Mixed reality (MR) technology shows promise for addressing these challenges by creating immersive, context-aware environments remotely that previously could only be achieved in clinical settings. To bridge the gap between MR's potential and its practical application in geriatric PT, we conducted in-depth interviews with three PT clinicians and six older adult patients to understand challenges with PT care and adherence that MR may address. Our findings inform design considerations for supporting older adults' needs through MR and outline technical requirements for practical implementation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.14452v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Statistical concepts often rely heavily on visual cues for comprehension, presenting challenges for individuals who face difficulties using visual information, such as the blind and low-vision (BLV) community. While prior work has explored making data visualizations accessible, limited research examines how BLV individuals conceptualize and learn the underlying statistical concepts these visualizations represent. To better understand BLV individuals' learning strategies for potentially unfamiliar statistical concepts, we conducted a within-subjects experiment with 7 BLV individuals, controlling for vision condition using blindfolds. Each participant leveraged three different non-visual representations (Swell Touch tactile graph (STGs), shaped data patterns on a refreshable display (BDPs), sonification) to understand three different statistical concepts in histograms (skewness, modality, kurtosis). We collected quantitative metrics (accuracy, completion time, self-reported confidence levels) and qualitative insights (gesture analysis) to identify participants' unique meaning-making strategies. Results revealed that the braille condition led to the most accurate results, with sonification tasks being completed the fastest. Participants demonstrated various adaptive techniques when exploring each histogram, often developing alternative mental models that helped them non-visually encode statistical visualization concepts. Our findings reveal important implications for statistics educators and assistive technology designers, suggesting that effective learning tools must go beyond simple translation of visual information to support the unique cognitive strategies employed by BLV learners.",

This paper presents an approach for social media feed value alignment. We adopt Schwartz's theory of Basic Human Values -- a broad set of human values that articulates complementary and opposing values forming the building blocks of many cultures -- and we implement an algorithmic approach that models and then ranks feeds by expressions of Schwartz's values in social media posts. Our approach enables controls where users can express weights on their desired values, combining these weights and post value expressions into a ranking that respects users' articulated trade-offs. Through controlled experiments (N=141 and N=250), we demonstrate that users can use these controls to architect feeds reflecting their desired values. Across users, value-ranked feeds align with personal values, diverging substantially from existing engagement-driven feeds.",

      "title": "Nudging the Somas: Exploring How Live-Configurable Mixed Reality Objects Shape Open-Ended Intercorporeal Movements",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.14432v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mixed Reality (MR) experiences increasingly explore how virtual elements can shape physical behaviour, yet how MR objects guide group movement remains underexplored. We address this gap by examining how virtual objects can nudge collective, co-located movement without relying on explicit instructions or choreography. We developed GravField, a co-located MR performance system where an \"object jockey\" live-configures virtual objects, springs, ropes, magnets, with real-time, parameterised \"digital physics\" (e.g., weight, elasticity, force) to influence the movement of headset-wearing participants. These properties were made perceptible through augmented visual and audio feedback, creating dynamic cognitive-somatic cues. Our analysis of the performances, based on video, interviews, soma trajectories, and field notes, indicates that these live nudges support emergent intercorporeal coordination and that ambiguity and real-time configuration sustain open-ended, exploratory engagement. Ultimately, our work offers empirical insights and design principles for MR systems that can guide group movement through embodied, felt dynamics.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.14374v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents the development of an interactive system for constructing Augmented Virtual Environments (AVEs) by fusing mobile phone images with open-source geospatial data. By integrating 2D image data with 3D models derived from sources such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Digital Terrain Models (DTM), the proposed system generates immersive environments that enhance situational context. The system leverages Python for data processing and Unity for 3D visualization, interconnected via UDP-based two-way communication. Preliminary user evaluation demonstrates that the resulting AVEs accurately represent real-world scenes and improve users' contextual understanding. Key challenges addressed include projector calibration, precise model construction from heterogeneous data, and object detection for dynamic scene representation.",

      "title": "Controllable Surface Diffusion Generative Model for Neurodevelopmental Trajectories",
      "content": "arXiv:2508.03706v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment, increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \\pm 0.62$.",

      "title": "Synaptic Theory of Chunking in Working Memory",
      "content": "arXiv:2408.07637v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Working memory often appears to exceed its basic span by organizing items into compact representations called chunks. Chunking can be learned over time for familiar inputs; however, it can also arise spontaneously for novel stimuli. Such on-the-fly structuring is crucial for cognition, yet the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we introduce a synaptic theory of chunking, in which short-term synaptic plasticity enables the formation of chunk representations in working memory. We show that a specialized population of ``chunking neurons'' selectively controls groups of stimulus-responsive neurons, akin to gating. As a result, the network maintains and retrieves the stimuli in chunks, thereby exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding how the brain organizes information in real time.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.14910v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The dynamic of thermosensitive neuronal networks under the influence of external electric fields is explored, focusing on hybrid coupling models that incorporate both electrical and chemical synapses. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of complex behaviors, including coherent, incoherent, and chimera states, which are influenced by the frequency of the external field and the cell size. Specificaly chemical coupling is shown to enhances the appearance of a typical chimera states called traveling chimera states, while the external electric field modulates synchronization based on its frequency. Low-frequency fields induce localized synchronization, whereas high-frequency fields exert minimal influence. The study also investigates the role of intrinsic electric fields, represented by cell size, and their effect on both individual neuron activity and network dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of how external fields control collective neuronal behavior and open up new possibilities for the modulation of neural activity.",

Recent advances in learning-based CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However, ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and topological correctness.",
