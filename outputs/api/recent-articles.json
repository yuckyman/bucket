      "title": "The neural basis of emotional generalization in empathy",
      "content": "The essence of empathy is generalization of emotion across persons. Here, we leverage recent theoretical advances in the neuroscience of generalization to help us understand empathy. We measured brain activity in human neurosurgical patients performing two tasks, one focused on identifying their own emotional response and one identifying emotional responses in others. We quantified the representational geometry of local field potential (LFP) high-gamma activity in four regions: the medial temporal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. We found encoding of both self- and other-emotions in all four regions, but codes for emotion and person are disentangled (that is, factorized) in the insula, but not the other regions. This factorized representation allows for cross-person generalization of emotion in a way that tangled (non-factorized) representations do not. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the insula uniquely contributes to social mirroring processes by which we understand emotions across individuals.",

      "content": "Retinal ganglion cells have traditionally been grouped into cells that are sensitive to luminance but not spatial structure and cells with responses that are enhanced by spatial structure. Neither category captures responses of mouse Off Transient alpha cells, which are largest for spatially homogeneous inputs and are suppressed by spatial structure. We identified two circuit mechanisms that together can explain this unusual spatial selectivity. First, inhibition to these cells is tuned to finer spatial structure than excitation, causing the balance of excitation and inhibition to depend on spatial scale. Second, the excitatory synapses onto these cells undergo strong synaptic depression and the modulation of that depression by presynaptic inhibition amplifies responses to the transition from spatially structured to homogeneous inputs. A spatiotemporal computational model incorporating these circuit features quantitatively recapitulates the observed dynamics. These findings reveal how localized inhibition and short-term plasticity jointly create the distinctive spatial selectivity of Off Transient cells.",

      "content": "The transcriptome of a brain cell encodes both its stable identity and its dynamic responses to environmental stimuli. While significant progress has been made in categorizing cell types within the brain, deciphering to what extent transcriptional identity and transcriptional state are related remains a major technical and conceptual challenge. Here, we present a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing atlas of the mouse hippocampus spanning physiological and pathological stimuli and multiple circadian phases, enabling unified analysis of activity-, circadian-, and cell-type-dependent transcriptional programs. Taxonomically assigned cell types are largely stable despite the induction of different activity states, with a notable exception in the dentate gyrus. Activity and circadian rhythm each drive robust, largely nonoverlapping transcriptional responses, with convergent regulation on genes involved in specific pathways, including endocannabinoid signaling, excitability, and chromatin remodeling. These results underscore the necessity of integrating cell-type taxonomy with transcriptional state to capture how diverse cell types respond to experience.",

      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

      "title": "Balancing accuracy and efficiency: co-design of hybrid quantization and unified computing architecture for spiking neural networks",
      "content": "The deployment of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is hindered by a critical algorithm-hardware mismatch: a fundamental trade-off between the accuracy degradation caused by aggressive quantization and the resource redundancy stemming from traditional decoupled hardware designs. To bridge this gap, we present a novel algorithm-hardware co-design framework centered on a Ternary-8-bit Hybrid Weight Quantization (T8HWQ) scheme. Our approach recasts SNN computation into a unified \u201c8-bit \u00d7 2-bit\u201d paradigm by quantizing first-layer weights to 2 bits and subsequent layers to 8 bits. This standardization directly enables the design of a unified PE architecture, eliminating the resource redundancy inherent in decoupled designs. To mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by aggressive first-layer quantization, we first propose a channel-wise dual compensation strategy. This method synergizes channel-wise quantization optimization with adaptive threshold neurons, leveraging reparameterization techniques to restore model accuracy without incurring additional inference overhead. Building upon T8HWQ, we propose a novel unified computing architecture that overcomes the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs by efficiently multiplexing processing arrays. Experimental results support our approach: On CIFAR-100, our method achieves near-lossless accuracy (<0.7% degradation vs. full precision) with a single time step, matching state-of-the-art low-bit SNNs. At the hardware level, implementation results on the Xilinx Virtex 7 platform demonstrate that our unified computing unit conserves 20.2% of lookup table (LUT) resources compared to traditional decoupled architectures. This work delivers a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202fthroughput improvement over state-of-the-art SNN accelerators\u2014with comparable resource utilization and lower power consumption. Our integrated solution thus advances the practical implementation of high-performance, low-latency SNNs on resource-constrained edge devices.",

      "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and cognitive function in elderly individuals. Early detection is vital to slow disease progression and enable timely therapeutic intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches for AD, however, often involve high time complexity and significant computational resource utilization, highlighting the need for more efficient automated solutions.MethodsThis study introduces a Resource Efficient Convolutional Neural Network (RECNN) framework for AD detection and diagnosis using brain MRI images. The methodology incorporates three main modules: Gabor transformation, data augmentation, and classification with an anomalous pixel segmentation algorithm. Gabor transforms are employed to enhance spatial frequency features and improve detection rates. Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of training samples. The RECNN classifier is then used for image classification, and functional morphological segmentation is applied to classify affected pixels into mild or advanced stages of AD. Two benchmark datasets are utilized for training and testing the proposed framework.ResultsThe proposed RECNN-based system demonstrated superior detection and classification performance compared with conventional AD detection methods. The model achieved improved accuracy and robustness, with segmentation results enabling the differentiation between mild and advanced AD cases. Comparative evaluation confirmed that RECNN significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high diagnostic reliability.DiscussionThe findings suggest that the RECNN framework offers a resource-efficient and accurate approach for AD detection using MRI data. By combining Gabor-based feature transformation, augmented data diversity, and advanced segmentation, the proposed method provides a scalable and clinically applicable tool for early diagnosis. Future work will extend the model to larger and more diverse datasets and explore hybrid architectures to further enhance diagnostic performance.",

      "content": "Navigating unfamiliar environments without vision is a considerable challenge for blind individuals, as it requires constructing accurate cognitive maps. Binaural audio feedback, which delivers spatialized auditory cues, has been proposed as a means of enhancing spatial navigation by leveraging the auditory system's natural ability to localize sounds in three dimensions. This study investigated whether binaural audio feedback offers measurable advantages over non-spatialized feedback in supporting spatial perception and mental representation. Fourteen participants, seven blind individuals and seven blindfolded sighted individuals, explored controlled environments under both feedback conditions and reconstructed the layouts using LEGO models. Performance was evaluated through spatial correlation analysis and distance accuracy measures. Results revealed no significant differences between binaural and non-spatialized conditions for either group. These findings indicate that spatialization of descriptive audio alone may not be sufficient to enhance spatial representations, suggesting that factors such as prior training, task design, and integration with other sensory cues may be critical for unlocking the full potential of binaural audio in assistive navigation.",
