      "title": "Coherent dynamics of thalamic head-direction neurons irrespective of input",
      "content": "While the thalamus is known to relay and modulate sensory signals to the cortex, whether it also participates in active computation and intrinsic signal generation remains unresolved. The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus broadcasts the head-direction (HD) signal, which is generated in the brainstem, particularly in the upstream lateral mammillary nucleus, and thalamic HD cells remain coordinated even during sleep. Here, by recording and manipulating neuronal activity along the mammillary-thalamic-cortical pathway, we show that coherence among thalamic HD cells persists even when their upstream inputs are decorrelated, particularly during non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep. These findings suggest that thalamic circuits are sufficient to generate and maintain coherent population dynamics in the absence of structured input.",

      "title": "Arousal-related mediation of perceptual belief updating across auditory domains",
      "content": "Belief updating refers to the integration of prior beliefs with incoming evidence and guides decision-making under uncertainty. In response to surprising events, this process is thought to be modulated by the locus-coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) arousal system, observable via pupil dilations (PDs). Pertinent literature has mostly focused on conscious, high-level decision-making and estimation processes, while assuming that the same principles apply to low-level sensory perceptual decision-making and generalize across tasks, domains and modalities. To address some of these assumptions, we devised a novel perceptual discrimination paradigm, investigating behavior and PDs across auditory domains. Participants were presented with auditory sequences of randomized length at a rapid pace, changing intermittently between two latent states: acceleration vs. deceleration (temporal group, N = 25) and clockwise vs. counterclockwise movement (spatial group, N = 22). Under high uncertainty, participants continuously inferred latent states to report the final state per sequence. To extract per-stimulus estimates of PDs during sequences, we fitted a deconvolution-based general linear model to the continuous pupil traces with a free amplitude parameter reflecting ongoing PDs. A Bayesian observer model was fitted to participants' responses and used to estimate information gain and surprisal for every stimulus. Participants' performance and PDs showed strong sensitivity to the occurrence of change-points. Both computational variables significantly predicted PDs in both domains, with information gain outperforming surprisal in a model comparison. Further model comparison revealed significant preference for models excluding possible domain-specific effects over models including them, pointing towards a constant effect over domains. We conclude that behavior and associated PDs observed in our purely perceptual auditory task align with Bayesian principles of belief updating. The observed lack of domain specificity supports the assumed generalizability of belief updating.",

      "title": "Is there a link between motor learning and mirror neuron system: TMS study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe mirror neuron system (MNS) activates during the performance of an action and during the observation of the same action being performed by another. At the motor output level, MNS activation manifests as motor resonance, or a muscle-specific increase in corticospinal excitability during action observation. This study focuses on how and to what extent motor learning alters the initial mirror response and whether the rate of motor learning is associated with pretraining or post-training levels of mirror response. The study involved 23 healthy adults aged 22.7 years on average. The experiment consisted of six sessions. On the first and last days, a transcranial magnetic stimulation session was performed to assess the putative activity of mirror neurons, as reflected in the level of motor-evoked potential facilitation during action observation under various conditions. From the second to the fifth sessions (four sessions), motor learning was performed, as represented in the form of a serial reaction time (SRT) task.ResultsWe observed a statistically significant decrease in reaction time during the process of learning within the SRT task and motor facilitation during action observation, thus reflecting putative mirror neuron activity. We found a significant correlation between the learning speed of the non-dominant hand and mirror neuron activation in the dominant hemisphere during the observation of button presses and pinch gestures.ConclusionThe MNS excitability is not a predictor of motor learning, but motor learning is reflected in the characteristics of the MNS.",

      "title": "Differences in dynamic functional connectivity between naturalistic music listening and rest in preadolescents",
      "content": "IntroductionEngagement with music is a significant aspect of adolescents' lives and this interest blossoms during preadolescence. Compared to the extensive body of research focused on adult music brain function, relatively few studies have examined the neural connections involved in music listening among adolescents and preadolescents. This study aims to investigate the dynamic patterns of brain functional connectivity and the transition processes during naturalistic music listening in preadolescents, measuring the transition of brain states from one time point to the next.MethodsWe employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity of 24 healthy preadolescents aged 8 to 12 years during both music listening and rest conditions. Subsequently, we applied a dynamic functional connectivity analysis, Leading Eigenvector Dynamics Analysis (LEiDA), to extract distinct brain states (phase locking patterns) and the corresponding transition processes.ResultsFindings show that occipital brain regions are actively engaged during music listening, possibly linked to attention regulation, visual imagery, and emotional processing. Additionally, we observed a more frequent transition from the default mode network (DMN) state to an orbitofrontal limbic state during music listening, evidencing cognitive shifts that facilitate emotional and reward processing. In contrast, during rest, we obtained a switch to the sensorimotor auditory network, suggesting intrinsic fluctuations in multiple networks.DiscussionThese findings deepen our understanding of subcortical and frontal brain connectivity in preadolescents during music listening, with implications for integrating music into educational practices to support learning and cognitive development.",

      "title": "Prognostic impact of collateral circulation in direct thrombectomy versus bridging thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion: a retrospective comparative study",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the prognostic impact of collateral circulation on outcomes of direct thrombectomy (DT) versus bridging thrombectomy (BT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO).MethodThis retrospective study included 460 AIS patients with anterior circulation LVO who underwent either DT (n\u202f=\u202f220) or BT (n\u202f=\u202f240). Collateral status was assessed using multiphase computed tomographic angiography. The primary outcome was functional prognosis at 3\u202fmonths, measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Prognostic factors for good prognosis (90-day mRS\u202f\u2264\u202f2) and adverse events were identified through multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.ResultsThe BT group had significantly higher rates of intracerebral hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation compared to the DT group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Good collateral circulation was independently associated with good prognosis and lower risk of serious adverse events (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Lower NIHSS scores, shorter OTR, absence of atrial fibrillation, and lower serum BNP levels were also significantly associated with favorable outcomes in AIS patients (all p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Elevated serum BNP levels increased the risk of serious adverse events in both DT and BT groups (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). ROC analysis showed that a combined model including NIHSS, BNP, collateral circulation, onset-to-reperfusion time, and atrial fibrillation achieved high predictive performance for good prognosis (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.907, 95% CI: 0.881\u20130.934, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).ConclusionCollateral circulation is a strong predictor of both functional recovery and risk of adverse events in AIS patients undergoing thrombectomy, regardless of treatment strategy. While serum BNP may offer additional prognostic value, its moderate performance and overlap with cardiovascular conditions suggest that it should be interpreted cautiously. Pre-intervention collateral assessment remains a valuable tool for guiding individualized treatment decisions.",

      "title": "Mutant mouse models implicate a role for mGluR1/5, prolyl isomerase (Pin1) and Homer1a interactions in wakefulness",
      "content": "IntroductionHealthy sleep and wake are integral to good health and occur when an organism is able to maintain long bouts of both sleep and wakefulness. Homer proteins have been shown to be important for sleep in both Drosophila and mice. For example, genetic deletion of Homer1a in mice results in failure to sustain long bouts of wakefulness. Homer1a has also been shown to amplify mGluR activity by facilitating binding of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 to mGluR. This study uses mouse models to evaluate whether the Homer1a null sleep phenotype may be dependent on the mGluR-Pin1 interaction and examines sleep/wake behavior.MethodsEEG recordings were used to determine and compare sleep and wake in three different mouse models and their littermate control mice. Mouse models included: mGluR(TS-AA) knock-in mice in which Pin1 binding is prevented and activity-dependent prolyl isomerization of mGluR is inhibited; mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice in which Homer binding is eliminated but Pin1 binding is allowed; and a Homer1a null, mGluR(F-R) double mutant mouse to evaluate whether Pin1 binding can rescue the Homer1a knock-out phenotype. Sleep-wake behavior was analyzed using traditional summary measures and a spike-and-slab mixture distribution to better characterize microarchitecture.ResultsKnock-in mGluR(TS-AA) mice display a reduced ability to sustain long bouts of wakefulness during the active lights off period, recapitulating part of the previously observed wake phenotype of the Homer1a knock-out mouse. Alteration of the Homer binding site to mGluR in mGluR(F-R) knock-in mice has no effect on the sleep phenotype, whereas crossing the mGluR(F-R) knock-in into the Homer null background resulted in increased duration of long wake bouts, suggesting a restored ability to maintain wakefulness, with other sleep/wake characteristics similar to littermate mice.ConclusionThese studies highlight the role of Pin1 binding to mGluR as a potential mechanism in the control of sleep/wake behavior. Future studies should explore whether other binding partners of Homer and mGluR also affect sleep and wake.",

This review summarizes the roles and mechanisms of A. muciniphila and its active components (e.g., the outer membrane protein Amuc_1100, extracellular vesicles AmEVs, and short-chain fatty acids SCFAs) in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), depression, cerebral palsy (CP), epilepsy (EP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It exerts protective effects by enhancing the intestinal barrier, regulating lipid metabolism, producing SCFAs, secreting neuroactive substances, and inhibiting neuroinflammation, thereby suggesting novel therapeutic avenues for neurological disorders. However, due to limited data from large-scale human clinical trials and the complexity of disease mechanisms and host\u2013microbiota interactions, its clinical translation faces considerable challenges. Future efforts should focus on multicenter randomized controlled trials and in-depth mechanistic studies utilizing technologies such as metabolomics to facilitate evidence-based clinical application.",

      "title": "Assessing consciousness in patients with locked-in syndrome using their EEG",
      "content": "Research indicates that locked-in syndrome (LIS) patients retain both consciousness and cognitive functions, despite their inability to perform voluntary muscle movements or communicate. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) provide a means for these patients to communicate, which is crucial, as the ability to interact with their environment has been shown to significantly enhance their wellbeing and quality of life. This paper presents an innovative approach to analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) data from four LIS patients to assess their consciousness levels, referred to as normalized consciousness levels (NCL) in this study. It consists of extracting different features based on frequency, complexity, and connectivity measures to maximize the probability of correctly determining the patients' actual states given the inexistence of ground truth. The consciousness levels derived from this approach aim to improve our understanding of the patients' condition, which is vital in order to build effective communication systems. Despite considerable inter-patient variability, the findings indicate that the approach is effective in detecting neural markers of consciousness and in differentiating between states across the majority of patients. By accurately assessing consciousness, this research aims to improve diagnosis in addition to determining the optimal time to initiate communication with these non-communicative patients. It is important to note that consciousness is a complex and difficult concept to define. In this study, the term \u201cconsciousness level\u201d does not refer to a medical definition. Instead, it represents a scale of NCL values ranging from 0 to 1 representing the likelihood of the patient being fully conscious (1) or not (0).",

      "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

      "title": "Personalized beta band HD-tACS over the left SMA improves speech and limb movement by modulating prefrontal delta oscillations in neurotypical young adults",
      "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",
