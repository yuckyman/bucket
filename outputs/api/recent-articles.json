      "title": "Critical point drying of brain tissue for X-ray phase contrast imaging",
      "content": "X-ray phase contrast tomography is emerging as a powerful method for imaging large volumes of brain tissue at sub-cellular resolution. However, current sample preparation methods are largely inherited from visible light or electron microscopy workflows and hence are not optimised to exploit the full potential of X-ray contrast mechanisms. Here we propose to replace interstitial material by air to enhance X-ray phase contrast of the ultrastructural features. We used critical point drying (CPD) of heavy metal-stained mouse brain tissue to produce mechanically stable samples with preserved ultrastructure and enhanced refractive index boundaries, a nanofoam-like material that remains compatible with follow-up conventional resin embedding. Using two complementary synchrotron-based setups, a high-throughput microtomography beamline (P14, DESY) and a nanoscale holographic tomography beamline (ID16A, ESRF), we found that CPD samples consistently showed 2-4x stronger phase-shift signal than conventional resin-embedded tissue. The contrast gain remained consistent across samples, imaging conditions, and beamlines. Our results suggest that CPD offers a generalisable route for preparing tissue for high-resolution X-ray imaging. It retains structural detail while improving signal, and is compatible with other processing procedures like femtosecond laser milling or electron microscopy, paving the path for large-scale biological tissue imaging.",

      "title": "Non-synaptic Mechanism of Ocular Dominance Plasticity",
      "content": "Classic experiments showing that monocular visual disruption alters synaptic connections to binocular neurons in the brain established the fundamental concept of synaptic plasticity through coincident spike time arrival. However, if the speed of impulse transmission from the eye is altered by visual deprivation, spike time arrival at binocular neurons would be affected, thereby inducing synaptic plasticity. This possibility is tested here in adult mice by monocular eyelid suture and action potential inhibition in retinal axons. The results show that spike time arrival in visual cortex is altered by monocular visual disruption in association with morphological changes in myelin (nodes of Ranvier) on axons in optic nerve and optic tract. This non-synaptic mechanism of ocular dominance plasticity, mediated by myelin-forming cells, supplements and may drive synaptic plasticity.",

      "title": "Preserved synaptic architecture but impaired ketamine-induced synaptic plasticity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the aged frontal cortex",
      "content": "Healthy aging is accompanied by a gradual decline in higher-order cognitive functions, including working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility, processes that critically rely on intact frontal cortical circuits. While neuronal loss is minimal during aging, whether there are changes in functional plasticity in this region remains unexplored. In this regard, dendritic spines, the primary postsynaptic structures of excitatory synapses, act as key hubs for experience-dependent synaptic remodeling. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging in Thy1-eGFP-M mice, we examined age-related changes in dendritic spine density and dynamics in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of the secondary motor area (MOs), a frontal cortical region essential for strategy switching and cognitive flexibility, and that was assessed using an operant conditioning paradigm. We found that aged mice (18 to 22 months) exhibited significant impairments in cognitive flexibility relative to young mice (3 to 5 months) in the four-odor choice discrimination and reversal task. Analysis of dendritic spine plasticity revealed that baseline spine density, turnover, and morphology were largely preserved in aged mice. Sex differences were evident, with females displaying higher spine density and a greater fraction of stable spines, a feature maintained across aging. Importantly, despite preserved baseline architecture, aged mice showed impaired ketamine-induced spinogenesis and reduced stabilization of newly formed spines, in contrast to the robust structural plasticity observed in young mice. These results indicate that healthy aging selectively impairs activity-dependent synaptic remodeling without affecting steady-state spine architecture in frontal cortical circuits. By linking deficits in induced synaptic plasticity to age-related impairments in cognitive flexibility, our study highlights the critical need to target plasticity mechanisms as a therapeutic strategy to restore executive function and cognitive adaptability in the aging brain.",

      "content": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection through mammography significantly improves outcomes, with breast density acting as both a risk factor and a key interpretive feature. Although the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) provides standardized density categories, assessments are often subjective and variable. While automated tools exist, most are proprietary and resource-intensive, limiting their use in underserved...",

This suggests that the near heterophoria and fusional reserves of children using 0.05% atropine for myopia control should be monitored closely.",
