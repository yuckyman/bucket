      "title": "Dynamic mode decomposition of resting-state fMRI revealing abnormal brain region features in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Measurement effects on critical scaling in neural systems",
      "content": "The recently developed phenomenological renormalization group (pRG) analysis has uncovered scale-free properties in large-scale neural population recordings across recording modalities, including extracellular electrophysiology and calcium imaging. The convergence of these properties across the datasets hints at universal neural behavior. Yet, it is unknown how differences in temporal resolution and measurement details affect pRG scaling. Here, we use a network model known to produce scaling under pRG analysis as a testbed to assess how recording and analysis choices shape inferred scaling exponents. We show that scaling properties depend on the choices of temporal binning, measurement nonlinearities, and deconvolution, and that the quality of scaling for cluster covariance eigenvalues is particularly sensitive to measurement effects. Moreover, all scaling exponents shift substantially with these transformations, even when the underlying neural dynamics are identical. Together, these results show how experimental choices can change pRG scaling and provide a framework for separating scaling driven by neural dynamics from that introduced by the recording method.",

      "content": "Serotonin is thought to regulate emotional learning and memory, but there remains much to be explored regarding its causal role in cued fear conditioning and extinction (CFC-E). Recent in vivo recording of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neuronal activity during CFC-E paradigm showed that the time course of serotonin level includes both rapid responses to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli and a slowly accumulating component that spans inter-trial intervals and reverses during extinction. By reviewing the studies that directly link the fear expression during CFC-E to the acute or chronic perturbations of serotonin dynamics at the organism level or within specific brain areas via pharmacological, genetic, and projection-specific manipulations, we argue that theoretical models defining the causal role of serotonin must incorporate continuous-time serotonin dynamics.",

      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a longstanding means of non-invasively recording brain signals and has become highly valuable for the study of neurological and cognitive processes. Recent progress in deep learning has also greatly improved both EEG signal analysis and interpretation, making more accurate, reliable and scalable solutions in various healthcare applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the convergence of EEG and deep learning, with an emphasis on diagnostic of neurological disorders, brain recovery, mental health conditions, and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. We methodically investigate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, transformer models and hybrid architectures for EEG-based tasks. Key challenges that have been hampering emerging solutions are critically covered, namely signal-related variability, the lack of data, and deep learning model limited interpretability.

      "title": "Randomized prenatal and postnatal nutrient supplementation shows no long-term impact on cortical gray matter in Ghanaian children",
      "content": "IntroductionMaternal and child undernutrition are linked to atypical brain development in children. Provision of pre- and post-natal small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) has been shown to positively impact children\u2019s growth and development. It is unknown, however, whether SQ-LNS affects child brain morphology.MethodsThe present study used data from the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements randomized controlled trial in Ghana. Participants were 231 children (Mage = 10.6 years; 49.4% female) exposed to maternal iron and folic acid supplements prenatally (n = 113, control group) or maternal SQ-LNS prenatally until 6 mo postpartum and child SQ-LNS from age 6 to 18 months (n = 118, SQ-LNS group). Children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain anatomy. Primary outcomes were total gray matter volume, cortical gray matter thickness, and cortical gray matter volume assessed with whole-brain analyses. Secondary outcomes were thickness and volume of a priori specified cortical and subcortical regions assessed with region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Basic and full covariate models were tested and corrected for multiple comparisons.ResultsWhole-brain analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in total gray matter volume or cortical gray matter thickness or volume. Cortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) thickness [mean (95%CI): 2.78 (2.73, 2.84) vs. 2.72 (2.67, 2.77); effect size = 0.21] and reduced left rostral ACC volume [2575.1 (2477.3, 2672.8) vs. 2678.74 (2568.7, 2788.8); effect size = 0.18]. Subcortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater volume of the left pallidus [1794.45 (1759.10, 1829.80) vs. 1726.13 (1685.05, 1767.21); effect size = 0.33] and right nucleus accumbens [751.54 (729.83, 773.24) vs. 705.73 (684.21, 727.24); effect size = 0.39]. Significant group differences did not hold after correction for multiple comparisons.DiscussionIn this cohort, pre- and post-natal SQ-LNS supplementation did not significantly alter total or cortical gray matter thickness and volume at 10 years, though secondary ROI analyses indicated subtle, non-robust differences in selected regions.",

      "title": "MicroRNA profiling in post-mortem spinal cord of C9ORF72-related ALS patients reveals molecular pathways involved in motor neuron degeneration",
      "content": "IntroductionAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder causing progressive motor neuron death in cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. The most common genetic cause is the G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the non-coding region of exon 1 of C9ORF72, accounting for ~40% of familial and ~7% of sporadic ALS. RNA dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to ALS pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in motor neuron degeneration in C9ORF72-ALS.MethodsWe profiled 754 miRNAs in human post-mortem spinal cord tissue from C9ORF72-ALS patients and healthy donors. Laser capture microdissection isolated ventral horn regions, and in silico target prediction identified potential genes and pathways regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs. Target genes were validated by Real time PCR.ResultsTwo subsets of miRNAs were exclusively expressed in ventral horn regions: miR-200b-3p and miR-346 in C9ORF72-ALS patients, and miR-30d-5p, miR-106b-5p and miR-135a-5p in healthy donors. Target prediction and molecular analysis identified putative genes and pathways linked to cell death, inflammation, protein metabolism, DNA modification, excitotoxicity, autophagy and vesicles trafficking.DiscussionThis study identifies specific miRNAs and their target genes as key molecules in motor neuron degeneration in C9ORF72-ALS. Restoring their expression could represent a therapeutic approach for ALS.",

      "title": "A narrative review of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) applications in hearing loss, tinnitus and vestibular disorders",
      "content": "IntroductionFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising neuroimaging modality for investigating cortical activity in auditory and vestibular domains. Its portability, device compatibility, and motion tolerance make it particularly suited for use in populations that are challenging to study with conventional neuroimaging techniques, such as infants and cochlear implant (CI) users. The present study aims to explore the potential and limitations of this neuroimaging technique in the audiological and vestibular fields, offering an integrated perspective across pediatric, adult and elderly populations.MethodsA narrative review of studies using fNIRS in hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disorders was conducted through searches in PubMed and Scopus up to March 2025. Studies were included if they employed fNIRS to investigate cortical responses in individuals with diagnosed hearing loss, chronic tinnitus or to investigate vestibular function.ResultsA total of 60 studies were reviewed: 36 on hearing loss, 11 on tinnitus, and 13 on vestibular disorders. In hearing research, fNIRS successfully identified cortical activation patterns related to auditory perception, speech processing, and cross-modal plasticity in CI users across development, adulthood and aging. The technique showed prognostic potential in predicting CI outcomes and monitoring listening effort and cognitive load. In tinnitus research, fNIRS consistently demonstrate hyper-activation in the auditory cortex and altered functional connectivity with frontal-limbic networks, reflecting sensory, cognitive, and emotional involvement. The technique was sensitive to treatment effects following interventions such as transcranial stimulation, acupuncture, and cochlear implantation. In vestibular research, fNIRS enabled the mapping of cortical networks involved in balance control and multisensory integration during various stimulation paradigms, including caloric testing, motion platforms, and optic flow in virtual environments. Although current applications are mostly exploratory, findings suggest fNIRS can capture vestibular-related cortical activity in real-world conditions.ConclusionfNIRS offers a valuable, non-invasive, and ecologically valid method for investigating auditory and vestibular function across the lifespan. In hearing and tinnitus research, it shows strong potential for clinical translation, especially if methodological standardization is achieved. Applications in vestibular research remain preliminary but promising.",

      "content": "BackgroundCurrent clinical research suggests that the ketogenic diet (KD) intervention can alleviate Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This pilot study explored the potential link between KD-induced clinical improvements and gut microbiota alterations.MethodsWe engaged 27 PD patients in a 12-week ketogenic dietary trial (16 completed) and employed 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze gut microbiota differences compared to 27 healthy controls.ResultsBaseline analysis revealed distinct dysbiosis in PD patients, characterized by increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Following the 12-week intervention, patients exhibited significant improvements in both motor (MDS-UPDRS Part III, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). These clinical improvements were accompanied by specific microbial shifts: a significant increase in Enterococcus and Synergistota, and a decrease in Alloprevotella.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the therapeutic effects of the ketogenic diet in PD are associated with specific remodeling of the gut microbiota, particularly the enrichment of potential beneficial taxa and reduction of pro-inflammatory genera.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/index.html, Unique Identifier: ChiCTR2100045394.",

      "title": "Perceptual punctuation: fixational eye movements reveal segmentation of auditory streams",
      "content": "IntroductionPerception operates as rhythmically structured sampling in which temporal predictions determine when incoming signals are weighted. Fixational eye movements carry opposing consequences, enhancing acuity yet inducing brief peri-saccadic suppression, suggesting that their timing is paced by expected, salient rhythms. Auditory scenes can be parsed into competing streams that unfold over time. If fixation dynamics are shaped by temporal expectation, and auditory streaming imposes a percept-dependent temporal structure on otherwise identical acoustics, then fixational eye movements might provide a window into how listeners parse sound over time. We asked whether fixational eye movements reflect the perceived rather than the physical temporal organization of an ambiguous ABA\u2013 pattern.MethodsWhile listeners fixated and either attended High, Low, or All tones (Experiment 1, n = 15) or freely reported their percept (Experiment 2, n = 15), we recorded binocular eye position (500 Hz) and quantified microsaccade (MS) dynamics and eye-velocity spectra.ResultsAcross both experiments, eye-velocity spectra showed a percept-dependent redistribution between 2 and 4 Hz, with relative power shifting with the instructed/reported stream. A normalized 4\u20132 Hz index (\u0394PSD) separated Low-tone from High-tone percepts across procedures. Time-resolved analyses further revealed within-trial waxing-and-waning of 2 vs. 4 Hz dominance, consistent with bistable fluctuations in maintaining a stream. Moreover, microsaccade reaction time (msRT), aligned to the onset of the sound sequence, differed significantly depending on the percept.DiscussionThese findings extend oculomotor inhibition beyond discrete events, positioning fixation dynamics as a sensitive, report-free marker of auditory scene organization. We discuss mechanistic links to temporal attention and active sensing, and implications for a multisensory timing framework.",
