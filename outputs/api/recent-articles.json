      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Contextual associations impact visual search across multiple processing stages",
      "content": "Growing evidence indicates that visual search is influenced not only by perceptual but also by semantic information. Among such semantic influences, categorical effects have been extensively studied. By contrast, the influence of contextual associations, that is, how objects commonly co-occur within specific scene contexts, remains less understood. Here, we orthogonally manipulated contextual and categorical relationships between target and distractor objects in a visual search task, while controlling for perceptual target-distractor similarity. By applying linear regression analyses, we modelled behavioral responses and event-related potentials (ERPs) from contextual, categorical, and perceptual target-distractor similarity. We found that contextual associations guide attention independently during early processing (modulating the N1pc ERP component), subsequently interact with categorical information (modulating the N2pc), and ultimately shape behavioral search performance jointly with perceptual and categorical similarity. These findings demonstrate that contextual object associations influence visual search across multiple processing stages, thereby supporting attentional guidance in everyday visual tasks.",

      "content": "Many studies have analyzed what organizational features distinguish the left and right hemispheres of the human brain, with most differences typically being found in language areas. In this analysis, we test whether supervised learning can categorize an unseen hemisphere as right or left based on functional connectivity. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, we find success to be extremely high (accuracies > .90) in right-handed participants (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [EHI] > 0). Accuracies are still high, but slightly lower when trained on left-handed participants (EHI <= 0). In a third analysis, we test whether the same can be done to identify handedness along with hemisphere chirality. This does not succeed, however, we show that individuals' hemispheres are less distinct the more left-handed they are. Our findings can inform developmental and post-injury work on hemispheric organization.",

      "title": "Striatal pathology in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 mice: A comparative study with Huntingtons disease",
      "content": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) and Huntingtons disease (HD), are motor diseases caused by CAG expansions in ATXN1 and HTT, where SCA1 shows prominent cerebellar neurodegeneration and HD shows prominent striatal neurodegeneration, particularly in the Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs). Since human and mouse studies demonstrate progressive striatal vulnerability in SCA1, we examined age-dependent molecular, cellular and functional striatal attributes in SCA1 (f-ATXN1146Q/2Q) knockin mice, by assessing RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. Striatal mRNAs are downregulated in SCA1 mice, many in common with HD mice, and specificity in MSNs is supported by the rescue of transcriptomic dysregulation with deletion of mutant Ataxin1 from MSNs. Immunohistochemistry assessed dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) and 2 (D2R) expression in indirect and direct MSNs. In HD mice (HttQ175/Q7), expression of both D1R and D2R proteins in MSNs decreased with age in parallel with their RNA levels. In the SCA1 mouse striatum, D1R protein expression decreased with age as seen in murine HD striatum. In contrast, while D2R protein level was decreased similar to D1R protein at 5-weeks of age, by 40-weeks expression of D2R protein recovered to levels recorded in WT mice. Electrophysiological assessment showed a reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission in SCA1 mouse MSNs, indicating functional deficits early in disease. In contrast to cerebellar and many other aspects of SCA1 pathology known to depend on proper nuclear localization of ATXN1 with an expanded polyglutamine, mutating ATXN1s nuclear localization failed to correct striatal MSN RNA and protein downregulations, indicating a difference in how ATXN1 exerts its pathological effects between the cerebellum and the striatum. Together, these data provide a molecular and cellular basis of striatal pathology in SCA1.",
