      "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
      "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

      "title": "The Interactive Effects of Negative Emotion and Reward Motivation on Visual Perception",
      "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

      "title": "Suppressive Interactions between Nearby Stimuli in Visual Cortex Reflect Crowding",
      "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",

      "title": "Attention Decoding at the Cocktail Party: Preserved in Hearing Aid Users, Reduced in Cochlear Implant Users",
      "content": "Users of hearing aids (HAs) and cochlear implants (CIs) experience significant difficulty understanding a target speaker in multi-talker environments or when other background noise is present. Segregation of a particular voice from background noise occurs partly through enhanced cortical tracking of amplitude fluctuations in the target signal. Measuring a person's cortical tracking allows decoding their focus of attention and may be used for neurofeedback in hearing devices, potentially aiding their users with speech-in-noise comprehension. Most studies on cortical tracking have employed typical hearing (TH) individuals, whereas studies in people with hearing impairment whose cortical tracking may differ are still scarce. The objective of this study was to compare cortical speech tracking of HA (n=29) and CI users (n=24) to that of age-matched TH individuals (n=29). We recorded EEG data while the participants attended one of two competing talkers (one with a female and one with a male voice), in a free-field acoustic environment. Importantly, HA users as well as CI users used their personal, clinically-fitted devices. Cortical speech tracking was assessed through linear backward and forward models that related the EEG data to the speech envelope. For the CI users, electrical artifacts stemming from the implant were addressed through a bespoke method for artifact rejection. We found that the HA group exhibited cortical tracking and attentional modulation that were largely comparable to those of the TH group. CI users also showed successful cortical tracking. However, they displayed a profound deficit in attentional modulation, seen in the significantly poorer neural segregation of the attended vs. the ignored speech streams. These results shed light on a neurobiological mechanism for speech-in-noise comprehension and have implications for neurofeedback in hearing devices.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.20129v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Authoring 3D scenes is a central task for spatial computing applications. Competing visions for lowering existing barriers are (1) focus on immersive, direct manipulation of 3D content or (2) leverage AI techniques that capture real scenes (3D Radiance Fields such as, NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) and modify them at a higher level of abstraction, at the cost of high latency. We unify the complementary strengths of these approaches and investigate how to integrate generative AI advances into real-time, immersive 3D Radiance Field editing. We introduce Dreamcrafter, a VR-based 3D scene editing system that: (1) provides a modular architecture to integrate generative AI algorithms; (2) combines different levels of control for creating objects, including natural language and direct manipulation; and (3) introduces proxy representations that support interaction during high-latency operations. We contribute empirical findings on control preferences and discuss how generative AI interfaces beyond text input enhance creativity in scene editing and world building.",

Therefore, numerous studies were conducted to examine communication patterns in esports teams. While non-verbal communication has been extensively investigated, research on assessing voice-based verbal communication patterns remains relatively understudied. In this study, we propose a framework that automatically assesses verbal communication patterns by constructing networks with utterances transcribed from voice recordings. Through a data collection study, we obtained 84 game sessions from five League of Legends teams and subsequently investigated how verbal communication patterns varied across different conditions. As a result, we revealed that esports players exhibited broader and more balanced participation in collaborative situations, increased utterances over time with the largest rise in decision making, and team-level differences that were contingent on effective professional training. Building upon these findings, this study provides a generalizable tool for analyzing effective team communication.",

During this workshop, participants will experience a structured three-phase methodology: creating a human-led narrative foundation, identifying strategic gaps, and collaborating on AI enhancements. The workshop combines theoretical foundations with intensive hands-on practice, enabling participants to create compelling HCI visual narratives that demonstrate effective human-AI partnership. Through sequential art techniques, storyboarding exercises, and guided AI integration, attendees learn to communicate complex interactive concepts, accessibility solutions, and user experience flows while preserving narrative coherence and creative vision. Building on our successful workshops at ACM C&amp;C 2025, this session specifically addresses the needs of the Chinese HCI community for culturally informed and pedagogically sound approaches to AI integration in creative education.",

      "title": "Developers' Experience with Generative AI -- First Insights from an Empirical Mixed-Methods Field Study",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.19926v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With the rise of AI-powered coding assistants, firms and programmers are exploring how to optimize their interaction with them. Research has so far mainly focused on evaluating output quality and productivity gains, leaving aside the developers' experience during the interaction. In this study, we take a multimodal, developer-centered approach to gain insights into how professional developers experience the interaction with Generative AI (GenAI) in their natural work environment in a firm. The aim of this paper is (1) to demonstrate a feasible mixed-method study design with controlled and uncontrolled study periods within a firm setting, (2) to give first insights from complementary behavioral and subjective experience data on developers' interaction with GitHub Copilot and (3) to compare the impact of interaction types (no Copilot use, in-code suggestions, chat prompts or both in-code suggestions and chat prompts) on efficiency, accuracy and perceived workload whilst working on different task categories. Results of the controlled sessions in this study indicate that moderate use of either in-code suggestions or chat prompts improves efficiency (task duration) and reduces perceived workload compared to not using Copilot, while excessive or combined use lessens these benefits. Accuracy (task completion) profits from chat interaction. In general, subjective perception of workload aligns with objective behavioral data in this study. During the uncontrolled period of the study, both higher cognitive load and productivity were perceived when interacting with AI during everyday working tasks. This study motivates the use of comparable study designs, in e.g. workshop or hackathon settings, to evaluate GenAI tools holistically and realistically with a focus on the developers' experience.",

      "title": "Detecting cyberbullying in Spanish texts through deep learning techniques",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.19899v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent recollected data suggests that it is possible to automatically detect events that may negatively affect the most vulnerable parts of our society, by using any communication technology like social networks or messaging applications. This research consolidates and prepares a corpus with Spanish bullying expressions taken from Twitter in order to use them as an input to train a convolutional neuronal network through deep learning techniques. As a result of this training, a predictive model was created, which can identify Spanish cyberbullying expressions such as insults, racism, homophobic attacks, and so on.",

      "title": "Free-Will vs Free-Wheel: Understanding Community Accessibility Requirements of Wheelchair Users through Interviews, Participatory Action, and Modeling",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.19898v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Community participation is an important aspect of an individuals physical and mental well-being. This participation is often limited for persons with disabilities, especially those with ambulatory impairments due to the inability to optimally navigate the community. Accessibility is a multi-faceted problem and varies from person to person. Moreover, it depends on various personal and environmental factors. Despite significant research conducted to understand challenges faced by wheelchair users, developing an accessibility model for wheelchair users by identifying various characteristic features has not been thoroughly studied. In this research, we propose a three-dimensional model of accessibility and validate it through in-depth qualitative analysis involving semi-structured interviews and participatory action research. The outcomes of our studies validated many of our hypotheses about community access for wheelchair users and identified a need for more accessible path planning tools and resources. Overall, this research strengthened our three-dimensional User-Wheelchair-Environment model of accessibility.",

      "title": "Visualizing a Collective Student Model for Procedural Training Environments",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.19885v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visualization plays a relevant role for discovering patterns in big sets of data. In fact, the most common way to help a human with a pattern interpretation is through a graphic. In 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training the student interaction is more varied and complex than in traditional e-learning environments. Therefore, the visualization and interpretation of students' behaviors becomes a challenge. This motivated us to design the visualization of a collective student model built from student logs taken from 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training. This paper presents the design decisions that enable a suitable visualization of this model to instructors as well as a web tool that implements this visualization and is intended: to help instructors to improve their own teaching; and to enhance the tutoring strategy of an Intelligent Tutoring System. Then, this paper illustrates, with three detailed examples, how this tool can be used to those educational purposes. Next, the paper presents an experiment for validating the utility of the tool. In this experiment we show how the tool can help to modify the tutoring strategy of a 3D virtual laboratory. In this way, it is shown that the proposed visualization of the model can serve to improve the performance of students in 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training.",

      "title": "How Tech Workers Contend with Hazards of Humanlikeness in Generative AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.19832v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI's humanlike qualities are driving its rapid adoption in professional domains. However, this anthropomorphic appeal raises concerns from HCI and responsible AI scholars about potential hazards and harms, such as overtrust in system outputs. To investigate how technology workers navigate these humanlike qualities and anticipate emergent harms, we conducted focus groups with 30 professionals across six job functions (ML engineering, product policy, UX research and design, product management, technology writing, and communications). Our findings reveal an unsettled knowledge environment surrounding humanlike generative AI, where workers' varying perspectives illuminate a range of potential risks for individuals, knowledge work fields, and society. We argue that workers require comprehensive support, including clearer conceptions of ``humanlikeness'' to effectively mitigate these risks. To aid in mitigation strategies, we provide a conceptual map articulating the identified hazards and their connection to conflated notions of ``humanlikeness.''",

      "title": "Predicting Student Actions in a Procedural Training Environment",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.19810v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Data mining is known to have a potential for predicting user performance. However, there are few studies that explore its potential for predicting student behavior in a procedural training environment. This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are firstly grouped into clusters. Then an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.",
