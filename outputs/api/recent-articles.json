      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

      "content": "The n-back task has become a central paradigm for investigating the mechanisms of working memory (WM) and related executive functions. This review provides an integrative analysis of the n-back experiment, covering its cognitive operations, task variants, neuroimaging findings, and practical applications across multiple domains. We first delineate three core cognitive components\u2014updating, maintenance, and attentional control\u2014and summarize converging evidence that these functions rely on overlapping fronto-striatal and fronto-parietal networks. We then examine major task variants and review applications in: (1) cognitive training and transfer effects, particularly the proposed association between WM and fluid intelligence; (2) clinical contexts including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and neurological rehabilitation; (3) developmental and educational settings; and (4) emerging research on social cognition, stress, and emotional regulation. Critically, this review evaluates ongoing inconsistencies in how the n-back task is interpreted as a measure of WM and highlights methodological factors, such as task heterogeneity, multi-process interference, and mental fatigue, that complicate both behavioral and neural inferences. To address these issues, we outline methodological recommendations including adaptive task design, multimodal physiological monitoring, and standardized experimental protocols. We further discuss future directions involving virtual reality (VR), mobile platforms, and brain-computer interface (BCI) integration to improve ecological validity and translational relevance. By synthesizing behavioral and neural evidence, this review underscores the n-back task\u2019s versatility while emphasizing the need for improved construct clarity and methodological rigor.",

      "title": "Lexical retrieval in fluent and nonfluent aphasia: a network analysis of verbal fluency data",
      "content": "Lexical retrieval is commonly impaired in many persons with aphasia (PWA). Verbal fluency tasks are often used to assess lexical retrieval ability. However, common methods of analyzing verbal fluency data (e.g., total number of appropriate responses, clustering and switching) fail to adequately capture the underlying organization of the mental lexicon. To better understand the nature of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, this study applied a semantic network approach to verbal fluency data obtained from 120 healthy controls and 127 PWA (64 fluent and 63 nonfluent). Participants named as many animal category members as they could in 1\u202fmin, and their responses were converted into semantic networks. Global network metrics were computed for each group, including average shortest path length, clustering coefficient, and modularity. Compared to the healthy control network, the PWA network was less integrated and more fragmented, reflected by longer average shortest path lengths, reduced clustering, and higher modularity. These disruptions were especially evident in the nonfluent PWA network compared to the fluent PWA network. Complementary spreading activation and percolation analyses demonstrated that PWA networks were both less efficient and less resilient to disruption. Our results demonstrate that network-based analyses of verbal fluency provide a sensitive measure of lexical-semantic organization in aphasia, revealing structural disruptions that are not fully captured by traditional analyses. More broadly, this approach highlights how network science can advance theories of lexical-semantic organization and inform the development of individualized clinical assessments and treatment strategies.",

      "content": "BackgroundHigh-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that offers increased spatial precision compared to conventional tDCS. As its use has expanded across research and clinical settings, there has been increasing interest in understanding its safety and tolerability.ObjectiveThis review summarizes adverse events related to HD-tDCS in both healthy and clinical populations, focusing on how stimulation intensity, session frequency, and polarity influence tolerability.ResultsIn healthy populations, HD-tDCS is most often administered at 1\u20132\u2009mA for 20\u2009min. The most reported adverse events include tingling, itching and burning localized to the site of stimulation, typically described as mild or transient. Studies comparing active and sham stimulation generally report no significant differences in adverse event frequency or intensity, even at higher intensities of 2\u20133\u2009mA. Reports of severe adverse events are rare, and participant dropout due to discomfort is uncommon. Multi-session protocols show similar safety profiles, suggesting that repeated stimulation does not increase adverse effects. In clinical populations HD-tDCS is typically delivered across multiple sessions. Reported adverse events are mild and transient, with few reports of severe outcomes. Polarity-specific comparisons suggest that anodal and cathodal stimulation are similarly tolerated, with no notable differences in adverse event profiles.ConclusionOverall, current evidence indicates that HD-tDCS is a safe and well-tolerated technique across diverse populations and stimulation parameters. Continued use of standardized adverse event reporting will be important to further confirm these findings as clinical application broaden.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study aims to establish the risk factors and predictive model for the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma.MethodsData from 155 patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma at the affiliated hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from January 2018 to May 2023 were analyzed. These patients were randomly divided into a training group (108 cases, 70%) and a validation group (47 cases, 30%). Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis were conducted on the training group to identify risk factors for delayed hyponatremia after surgery. A predictive model was established using R software and validated.ResultsAfter conducting Univariate and Multivariate Logistic regression analysis, factors influencing the occurrence of delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma were identified as follows: elevated preoperative prolactin levels, higher preoperative suprasellar cistern height, and hyponatremia in the first 1\u20132\u202fdays after surgery. The area under the ROC curve for forecasting delayed postoperative hyponatremia (DPH) in training and validation sets was 0.943 and 0.959, respectively. The DCA curve indicated a higher benefit in clinical application.ConclusionThe risk prediction model for delayed hyponatremia after endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal resection of pituitary adenoma, developed in this study, demonstrates favorable predictive performance. The nomogram can be utilized for early identification of high-risk individuals for DPH.",

      "title": "Neurological mechanisms of mental fatigue in cognitive flexibility in soccer players: an event-related potential study based on N2 components",
      "content": "ObjectivesMental fatigue frequently occurs in team sports characterised by high cognitive demands and can adversely affect athletes\u2019 decision-making and executive functions. This study examines the impact of mental fatigue on cognitive flexibility in soccer players, employing event-related potentials (ERP) to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms.MethodEighteen football players from the China University Football Association (CUFA) participated in the study. The research utilised the Stroop task to induce mental fatigue and the More-odd switching task to evaluate cognitive flexibility, with measurement indicators comprising accuracy rate (ACC), reaction time (RT), and N2 component amplitude. The experimental design adhered to a repeated measures protocol, incorporating 2 (time: pre-fatigue/post-fatigue)\u202f\u00d7\u202f2 (task type: conversion/non-conversion)\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 (electrode positions: Fz, Cz, Pz, F3) factors. Statistical analyses of behavioural data were conducted using non-parametric tests, while ERP data were examined through repeated measures ANOVA.ResultsMental fatigue significantly impaired athletes\u2019 accuracy in the More-odd switching task, evidenced by decreased performance in both conversion and non-conversion conditions (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), alongside prolonged reaction times (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Event-related potential (ERP) analysis demonstrated a marked reduction in the amplitudes of the N2 component post-intervention, with notable differences across electrode sites (F\u202f=\u202f3.192, p\u202f=\u202f0.031). These findings suggest a restriction in cognitive control resources within the frontal and parietal regions.ConclusionThis study illustrates that experimentally induced mental fatigue has a significant detrimental impact on the cognitive performance of football players, leading to slower reaction times and decreased neural electrophysiological indicators (specifically, a reduction in N2 wave amplitude), indicating a decline in conflict monitoring ability. An integrated examination of both behavioural and neurophysiological data indicates that the adverse effects of mental fatigue are likely due to the depletion of general cognitive control resources that rely on the prefrontal cortex, rather than targeting particular cognitive functions. These results offer initial insights into the cognitive and neurological alterations in fatigued athletes. While the study did not explore interventions, the findings lay the groundwork for the development of tailored cognitive training programmes and fatigue management strategies, along with potential evaluation criteria. Notably, the N2 wave amplitude serves as a key metric for assessing cognitive resource levels in football players.",

      "title": "RS-STGCN: Regional-Synergy Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for emotion recognition",
      "content": "Decoding emotional states from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a fundamental goal in affective neuroscience. This endeavor requires accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. However, prevailing approaches for defining brain connectivity often fail to reconcile predefined neurophysiological priors with task-specific functional dynamics. This paper presents the Regional-Synergy Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RS-STGCN), a novel framework designed to bridge this gap. The core innovation is the Regional Synergy Graph Learner (RSGL), which integrates known physiological brain-region priors with a task-driven optimization process. It constructs a sparse, adaptive graph by modeling connectivity at two distinct levels. At the intra-regional level, it establishes core information backbones within functional areas. This ensures efficient and stable local information processing. At the inter-regional level, it adaptively identifies critical, sparse long-range connections. These connections are essential for global emotional integration. This dual-level, dynamically learned graph then serves as the foundation for the spatio-temporal network. This network effectively captures evolving emotional features. The proposed framework demonstrates superior recognition accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art results of 88.00% and 85.43% on the public SEED and SEED-IV datasets, respectively, under a strict subject-independent protocol. It also produces a neuroscientifically interpretable map of functional brain connectivity, identifying key frontal-parietal pathways consistent with established attentional networks. This work offers a powerful computational approach to investigate the dynamic network mechanisms underlying human emotion, providing new data-driven insights into functional brain organization.

      "content": "BackgroundFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is associated with widespread cognitive, behavioral, and adaptive impairments. Its clinical presentation often overlaps with other neurodevelopmental conditions (ND), such as learning disorders (LD) or Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), making differential diagnosis challenging. Although syndrome-specific cognitive patterns have been suggested, a distinctive neurocognitive profile of FASD remains inconclusive.MethodSeventy-six children (46 with FASD and 30 with ND), aged 6\u201315\u202fyears (M\u202f=\u202f11.00, SD\u202f=\u202f2.30), completed a comprehensive neuropsychological battery, covering domains of intellectual functioning, attention, memory, verbal skills, executive functions, and socio-emotional behavior.ResultsAs compared to normative ranges, children with FASD felt below expected levels in cognitive functioning. Moreover, children with FASD showed significantly lower performance than those with ND across all cognitive domains, including global intelligence, verbal comprehension, working memory, processing speed, attention, memory, and executive functions. At the socio-emotional level, parental reports revealed that children with FASD scored higher than their peers with ND on anxiety, social and thought problems, attentional difficulties, and aggression behavior, although most of them remained within non-clinical ranges.ConclusionFindings support the presence of a distinctive neurocognitive profile in FASD characterized by generalized cognitive deficits and domain-specific impairments (particularly in attention, memory, and executive functions). In addition, children with FASD scored higher on socio-emotional difficulties, although still within non-clinical ranges. These results highlight the clinical relevance of domain-specific assessment and underscore the need for early diagnosis and targeted evidence-based interventions to mitigate long-term cognitive and adaptive challenges associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.
