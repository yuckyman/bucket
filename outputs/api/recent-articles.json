      "title": "Symmetry constraints on feedback-driven orientation tuning dynamics in translation-invariant models of primate V1",
      "content": "Orientation selectivity in primate V1 is shaped by feedforward drive, intracortical recurrence, and corticocortical feedback. Yet a basic conceptual question remains: what aspects of orientation tuning can (or cannot) be altered by a recurrent/feedback loop that is rotationally symmetric in cortical space? We develop a minimal translation-invariant linear field model in which stimulus drive and recurrent interactions are analyzed in the spatial Fourier domain (k,{phi}). Our central analytic result is an exact symmetry constraint: for any temporally filtered but isotropic recurrent coupling W0(k,{omega}), the response at fixed (k,{omega}) is multiplied by an angle-independent complex gain. Consequently, any normalized orientation metric computed at fixed k--including circular variance, orientation selectivity index (OSI), and bandwidth--is invariant under isotropic recurrence. Isotropic recurrence can nevertheless rescale gain and select a spatial band through its k-dependence. We then show that adding a weak anisotropic component, especially when endowed with a slower timescale than a fast isotropic pathway, produces delayed sharpening and modest preferred-angle drifts. A perturbative calculation predicts linear scaling of tuning changes with anisotropy strength, and a simple phasor-sum formula explains {phi}*(t) drift when feedforward and feedback anisotropies compete. We provide stability criteria for the temporally filtered (auxiliary-variable) implementation and verify them numerically. Finally, we identify concrete regimes in which isotropic recurrence can alter measured tuning in practice, including finite-k readouts with k-dependent feedforward anisotropy and nonlinear (tuned) divisive-normalization readouts. Together these results sharpen a null hypothesis for perturbation experiments and delineate the minimal feature-specific ingredients required to explain dynamic tuning in macaque V1.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Kinematic fields of the visuo-hippocampal circuit",
      "content": "The structure of focused receptive fields in retinotopic and allocentric space in the visual cortex and hippocampus is studied extensively to understand cognitive functions such as stimulus tracking and path-integration, respectively. These functions require accurate tracking of running speed and acceleration. While speed dependence in these areas is well-studied, acceleration-dependence has received little attention, and the joint effect of speed-acceleration is unknown. Hence, we assessed the joint influence of these kinematic variables by computing receptive fields in a novel, 2D, phase space of speed-acceleration using the Allen Brain Visual Observatory data. Head-fixed mice ran spontaneously on a running wheel next to a monocular gray screen ensuring virtually no changes in the retinotopic or allocentric space. Remarkably, about half (44.3%, 6590/14862) of neurons in the visuo-hippocampal circuit (from LGN to subiculum) were significantly modulated by a specific combination of speed and acceleration to form receptive fields in the speed-acceleration phase space (called kinematic space). The prevalence of kinematic tuning is comparable to the fraction of place cells in the mouse hippocampus, and the fraction of visually tuned neurons in higher visual areas. The kinematic field size (~30% of the sampled space) was also comparable to the place field size. Kinematic fields spanned the entire space but preferred either low-speed, high-acceleration or the high-speed, low-acceleration segments. Although pupil size too varied spontaneously, the kinematic tuning exceeded pupil size tuning in all brain areas. Surprisingly, pupil size modulated the activity of ~20% of hippocampal neurons, which was comparable to that in LGN and visual cortical areas. Thus, all visuo-hippocampal areas have focused kinematic fields that are three times more prevalent than the pupil size fields in the absence of any vestibular, visual or spatial stimuli. This kinematic phase space could interface with retinotopic and allocentric spaces to guide natural behaviors involving movement.",

      "title": "Friendship modulates physical effort and neural dynamics during group coordination in shared social networks",
      "content": "Human social interactions are embedded within social networks, yet it remains unclear how existing interpersonal relationships influence the behavioural and neural dynamics of collective action. Here, we combined social network mapping with three-person EEG hyperscanning to investigate how friendships in shared networks modulate interpersonal coordination. We mapped social networks across seven undergraduate cohorts (N = 378) and recruited a subset of participants (N = 93) that consisted of triads of two mutually close friends and one non-friend from the same network. Triads performed a novel joint motor task in which participants produced forces towards a collective target. Non-friends consistently produced greater and more vigorous force than friends during joint action. This effect was strongest for non-friends embedded in smaller social networks. At the neural level, non-friends exhibited stronger alpha- and beta-band event-related desynchronization, higher inter-subject correlation, and increased inter-brain group phase synchrony. These neural signatures are consistent with increased action preparation, prediction, and attentional engagement during coordination. Taken together, these findings indicate that friendship and social network context are reflected in how individuals allocate physical effort and engage during collective action, and suggest that non-friends work harder and allocate more attention during joint tasks to compensate for the disparity in social standing. By linking real-world social relationships to behavioural and multi-brain neural dynamics, this work demonstrates that relational context is embodied in the mechanisms supporting human group coordination.",

      "content": "HIV-associated neurological complications remain a major concern in people living with HIV (PLWH), even under effective viral suppression with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), underscoring unresolved mechanisms driving HIV-related neurodegeneration. To address this gap, we used HIV-1-infected human cerebral organoids (hCOs) containing microglia as a physiologically relevant three-dimensional model of the central nervous system (CNS) and validated key findings in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected, cART-treated rhesus macaque model. Integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing with ATAC sequencing, we identified cell-type-specific alterations in dual innate immune-driven inflammatory signaling pathways across neural and glial populations. Microglia were preferentially infected and activated, initiating IL-17A-mediated cascades involving IFN{gamma}, STAT1, CEBPB, and NFkB pathways, which converged with cGAS-STING and Notch-NEURL1 signaling, both associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. cART suppressed viral replication, reduced IL-17A-driven neuroinflammation, improved mitochondrial function, and restored synaptic gene expression. Collectively, these findings identify IL-17A, STAT1, CEBPB, and cGAS-STING as key molecular drivers of HIV-associated neuroinflammation and establish a novel mechanistic link between IL-17A signaling and microglial remodeling, providing a translational framework for the development of CNS-targeted therapies in PLWH.",

      "title": "Cortical potentials evoked by stimulation of cervical vagus vs. auricular nerve: a comparative, parametric study in nonhuman primates",
      "content": "Stimulation of sensory vagal pathways is typically delivered via invasive, cervical vagus nerve stimulation (cVNS) or noninvasive, trans-auricular nerve stimulation (taNS). While both methods are investigated therapeutically, their effects on brain physiology remain poorly understood, hindering mechanistic understanding and stimulus optimization. In 6 awake nonhuman primates, we recorded cortical vagal-evoked potentials (VEPs) from subdural electrodes placed in prefrontal, sensorimotor and parietal cortical areas, in response to cVNS or taNS. Across 478 different taNS and cVNS protocols, we varied stimulation side, intensity, frequency, pulse count, and pulse width (PW) and assessed independent effects on amplitude and latency of early (EC; 30-100 ms), intermediate (IC; 101-200 ms) and late components (LC; 201-500 ms) of VEPs. Fixed and random effects of stimulation parameters and subjects, respectively, on VEP measurements, were assessed using a linear mixed-effects model. Overall, cVNS elicits more robust VEPs than taNS, with larger EC, IC and LC amplitudes in both hemispheres. cVNS-elicited ECs and LCs are largest in PFC and PC areas, whereas ICs are largest in SM areas. On the other hand, taNS generally does not elicit area-specific responses. cVNS-elicited ECs have slower latency than ta-NS elicited ECs. Higher stimulation frequencies and intensities and a longer pulse width elicit larger ECs and ICs for cVNS, and to some extent for taNS. Both short and long cVNS trains elicit stronger ECs, and long trains elicit slower ICs. Earlobe stimulation elicits VEPs that partially overlap with those from taNS. In conclusion, cVNS and taNS elicit cortical VEPs in a manner consistent with distinct engagement of ascending vagal pathways, and with similarities and differences in the effects of stimulation parameters on evoked responses.",
