      "title": "A system for high-throughput axonal imaging of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived human i3Neurons",
      "content": "Neurons have long, thin axons and branched dendritic processes which rely on an extensive microtubule network that functions as a cellular scaffold and substrate for cargo transport. Microtubule defects are a defining pathological feature of neurological disorders. The highly arborized, long, polarized neuronal processes pose challenges for imaging-based assays. Available methods use either dispersed cultures, which are inefficient for compartment-specific analyses, or microfluidic chambers, which allow clear separation of somatodendritic and axonal compartments but are expensive and difficult to maintain. Here, we introduce an i3Neurosphere culture model of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human cortical i3Neurons that enables high-throughput imaging of hundreds of axons without specialized equipment. We characterize neurite outgrowth, polarization, microtubule dynamics, and motility of diverse cargo, providing a reference for future work on microtubule processes in this system. The high-throughput compartment-specific imaging we present, combined with facile genetic engineering in i3Neurons provides a powerful tool to study human neurons.",

      "title": "Fronto-Parietal Oscillatory Dynamics of Emotion Regulation as a Function of Adult Attachment Orientations",
      "content": "Emotion regulation enables individuals to modulate emotional experiences and behaviors according to situational demands. Within attachment theory, individual differences in attachment anxiety and avoidance are conceived as interpersonal dispositions that influence the quality and efficiency of emotion regulation strategies, potentially shaping the underlying neural dynamics. This study examined cortical oscillatory activity during two regulation strategies-cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression-focusing on theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) bands at the source level. Forty adults (21 male, 18 female, 1 gender-unspecified; M = 27.58 years, SD = 8.71) performed an emotion regulation task involving emotionally evocative images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while EEG was recorded. Cortical sources were reconstructed using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) assessed the effects of condition, region of interest (ROI), and attachment orientations on oscillatory power. Results showed that higher attachment anxiety predicted reduced theta power in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during reappraisal, indicating attenuated recruitment of cognitive control mechanisms. In the beta band, suppression reduced activity in the right parietal lobe/precuneus - a region involved in self-referential and attentional processes - across participants, while during reappraisal, attachment anxiety was linked to lower beta power and attachment avoidance to higher beta power in the left dlPFC. Together, these findings indicate that cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression engage distinct cortical oscillatory systems, and that interpersonal dispositions modulate their neural implementation. Frontal theta appears to index top-down control during reappraisal, whereas beta activity shows a dual pattern: frontal beta variations reflect differences in control stability associated with attachment orientations, and parietal beta decreases during suppression suggest attentional disengagement from self-referential processing.",

      "title": "Asymmetric blood flow within a shared capillary network links the nucleus of the solitary tract and area postrema",
      "content": "The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and the area postrema (AP) form a tightly coupled dorsal medullary complex that integrates visceral and humoral signals governing autonomic and cardiometabolic regulation. While their neural interconnections are well characterized, the organization and functional significance of their shared vascular network remain poorly understood. Here, we used in vivo two-photon microscopy in rats, combined with fluorescent vascular labeling and retrograde neuronal tracing, to visualize and quantify blood flow within the AP-NTS microcirculation. We identified direct capillary connections between the two regions, confirming a continuous vascular network previously inferred from ex vivo studies. Analysis of red blood cell trajectories revealed that blood flow across these junctions is predominantly unidirectional, from the NTS toward the AP. Morphometric measurements showed that AP capillaries are nearly twice the diameter of those in the NTS, implying a lower local vascular resistance and providing a structural basis for this directionality. Despite these geometric differences, capillary flow velocities were similar between regions, consistent with active regulation that maintains stable perfusion dynamics. Together, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized, functionally asymmetric vascular pathway within the dorsal medulla. By enabling the directed transfer of diffusible neurohumoral signals from the NTS to the AP, this specialized microvascular network adds a novel layer of communication between two key brainstem autonomic centers and may represent an additional mechanism for the integration of visceral and circulating information.",

      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Hypovolemia Evokes Conserved Inverse Neurovascular Coupling in the Supraoptic Nucleus Independent of Heart Failure",
      "content": "Vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) are activated by systemic challenges that threaten fluid balance. Beyond their classical activity-dependent release of their neuropeptide cargo into the systemic circulation, these neurons also release AVP somatodendritically, enabling local modulation of neuronal excitability and vascular tone. We previously showed that a systemic salt challenge triggers inverse neurovascular coupling (iNVC) in the SON, in which activity-dependent dendritic AVP release induces parenchymal arteriole vasoconstriction and local hypoxia. In rats with heart failure (HF), however, the polarity of this salt-evoked response is reversed: microglia-derived adenosine acting on A2A receptors overrides an enhanced AVP-mediated vasoconstriction, producing net vasodilation. Still, whether AVP activation by non-osmotic stimuli engages similar neurovascular mechanisms is unknown. Here, we examined whether hypovolemia induced by intraperitoneal polyethylene glycol (PEG) evokes comparable vascular responses in control and HF rats. PEG produced a sustained rise in plasma protein concentration and vasoconstriction of SON parenchymal arterioles in both control and sham rats. In HF rats, PEG still induced vasoconstriction at 60 min, but vascular diameters returned to baseline by 90 min despite persistent hypovolemia. These findings indicate that hypovolemia engages a conserved AVP-mediated iNVC program that remains largely intact in HF, and that the previously described polarity reversal during HF is stimulus-specific, emerging during osmotic but not hypovolemic activation of AVP neurons.",

      "title": "Injury-induced tau pathology promotes aggressive behavior in Drosophila without neurodegeneration.",
      "content": "The microtubule-associated protein tau is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, but its physiological roles remain poorly understood. Here, we find that pan-neuronal expression of human tau (HsTau) in Drosophila coupled with injury triggers hyper-aggression in male flies, which is absent in flies expressing non-phosphorylatable tau. These behavioral manifestations result from activation of dopaminergic circuits without neurodegeneration. Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we find that phosphorylated HsTau maintains microtubule binding but loses its ability to suppress catastrophes, thereby promoting microtubule dynamicity. In contrast, unphosphorylated HsTau and fly tau (DmTau) stabilize microtubules by reducing catastrophe frequency. Our findings challenge the canonical view of tau as a simple microtubule stabilizer and instead position it as a dynamic regulator of microtubule function and neuronal excitability. These results reveal how acute tau phosphorylation can alter neural circuit function and behavior prior to neurodegeneration, providing new insights into tau's physiological and pathological roles.",
