      "title": "Macroscopic quantum effects in the brain: new insights into the fundamental principle underlying conscious processes",
      "content": "Empirical findings indicate that conscious states are inextricably linked to long-range synchronized activity patterns that result from phase transitions and exhibit the key features of self-organized criticality. This article builds a bridge between these neurophysiological characteristics of consciousness and the framework of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which provides the appropriate methodological resources for explaining the origin of phase transitions and critical dynamics. An essential ingredient of QED is a fluctuating ocean of energy, the ubiquitous electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF), consisting of a spectrum of normal modes. It can be deduced from QED-based model calculations that the resonant interaction of the ZPF with the glutamate pool of cortical microcolumns is an important prerequisite for the initiation of phase transitions, giving rise to macroscopic quantum effects that play a crucial role in modulating the activity of ion channels and regulating the neuronal firing rate. The firing rate of pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons determines the excitatory-inhibitory balance, which has been identified as the essential control parameter for establishing and maintaining the critical regime. Thus, taking all available pieces of evidence into account, profound new insights take shape, namely, that self-organized criticality arises from a bottom-up orchestration process involving the ZPF and that the fundamental principle behind the formation of conscious states is the resonant coupling of the brain to the ZPF. This coupling causes an amplification of the dynamically relevant ZPF modes, suggesting that the ZPF holds the key to the understanding of consciousness and that the necessary condition for the formation of a conscious state is the selective excitation of ZPF modes. These insights pave the way for novel experimental paradigms designed to systematically manipulate conditions in the brain, thereby collecting new data that can be used to empirically substantiate the significance of resonant brain-ZPF interaction for the formation of conscious states.",

      "title": "Effects of rTMS on swallowing function and neuroimaging features in post-stroke dysphagia",
      "content": "IntroductionDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is common after stroke and can lead to complications like malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and increased mortality. Recovery is driven by neural reorganization, yet traditional interventions focus on managing swallowing difficulties rather than restoring brain function. Neuromodulatory approaches like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) show potential for promoting brain plasticity and recovery. While rTMS has demonstrated efficacy in improving swallowing after stroke, few studies have explored its neural mechanisms at the brain level, as opposed to focusing on motor-evoked potentials recorded from peripheral muscles.MethodsThis study examined the effects of 5\u202fHz rTMS on post-stroke dysphagia by targeting the contralesional mylohyoid cortical area. Resting-state fMRI was employed to investigate the neural correlates of rTMS effects. Local brain activity was measured using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and percentage amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF), while network connectivity was assessed with graph theory analysis.ResultsrTMS reduced spontaneous activity in the contralesional middle frontal gyrus and putamen, and in the ipsilesional insula and middle frontal gyrus (pars orbitalis), regions that were hyperactive at baseline in dysphagic patients. Altered network topology in the left medial superior frontal gyrus suggested connectivity reorganization.ConclusionThese preliminary findings support rTMS as a promising adjunct therapy for post-stroke dysphagia by inducing cortical plasticity, as demonstrated by changes in both regional activity and network topology. Further validation in studies with larger samples is needed.",

      "content": "ObjectiveRecent advances in neuroimaging have highlighted the growing utility of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) as an alternative to task-based fMRI. In addition to being simpler, cost-effective, and time-efficient, rs-fMRI is particularly advantageous for non-compliant populations such as infants, elderly individuals, and patients with physical or cognitive impairments.MethodsMotivated by this, the present study introduces a novel Grayordinate Ensemble Modeling for Regression (GEMReg) framework for predicting task activation maps solely from rs-fMRI data, which, for the first time, leverages the rich temporal information of rs-fMRI for the task activation maps prediction. Specifically, the proposed approach uniquely formulates the task-activation map prediction as time series regression and exploits different temporal features and representations of the rs-fMRI for the same, including the proposed novel histogram-based features. Focusing on the individual characteristics of the grayordinates, 59412 individualized models (one per grayordinate) were trained by employing multiple univariate time series regressors. To optimize the prediction performance, a novel GEMReg framework is developed that selects the optimal feature-regressor combination for each grayordinate, exploiting the subtle variances in the individual grayordinate mapping. Furthermore, the temporal feature-based GEMReg is integrated with conventional functional connectivity maps-based spatial features, resulting in the spatio-temporal GEMReg, uniquely benefiting from both temporal and spatial features.Results and conclusionComparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed spatio-temporal GEMReg consistently outperforms existing methods across standard evaluation metrics, thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art for task activation map prediction using rs-fMRI.",

      "title": "Relationship between impaired cerebral lymphatic function and iron deposition, blood flow in VaD: a clinical MRI study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe neural mechanisms induced by cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in the vascular dementia (VaD) is extremely complex. Recent studies have identified altered lymphatic function as a key factor contributing to the development of cognitive deficits, whether they linked to iron deposition and reduced cerebral blood flow remains unclear.MethodsThe study involved 59 participants, comprising 30 healthy controls and 29 patients with VaD. Each participant underwent QSM, ASL, and DTI imaging scans and clinical measurements. The ALPS index based on DTI, QSM, and ASL for the left and right hemispheres, as well as for the whole brain were calculated and compared between groups. Regional mean susceptibility and mean CBF based on AAL template were calculated and compared between groups. Correlation analyses were performed between altered indexes and clinical measurements. Finally, mediation analyses were conducted to determine whether the mean susceptibility rate and mean CBF were involved in the modulation process of the ALPS.ResultsDTI-ALPS based analysis demonstrated a significantly lower ALPS index for the left, right, and whole brain in the VaD as compared to healthy controls. Mean susceptibility in the bilateral superior occipital gyrus and bilateral middle occipital gyrus was significantly higher, whereas mean CBF in the eft inferior frontal gyrus, opercular part, right rolandic operculum, right insula, and right heschl gyrus was significantly lower in the VaD. Further correlation analyses revealed associations between elevated mean susceptibility, reduced ALPS index, and cognitive impairments. Additionally, the results of correlation and mediation analyses suggested that CBF may be involved in the regulatory process of DTI-ALPS.ConclusionOur results demonstrated that altered lymphatic function is a key pathological factor in VaD, and reduced cerebral blood flow may play a role in this process. These findings provide a theoretical basis for identifying new targets in the treatment of VaD.",

      "title": "Quantitative assessment of signal quality and usability of EEG and EMG recordings with PEDOT:PSS-coated microneedle electrodes",
      "content": "IntroductionBioelectrical signals are vital indicators of physiological function, psychological status, and clinical conditions. However, traditional wet electrodes using conductive gel are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and degrade over time due to gel drying. Recently, microneedle (MN) electrodes coated with poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) have been developed for high-quality signal acquisition. Although low electrode\u2013skin impedance has been demonstrated on hairless regions, their use in electroencephalography (EEG) recordings on hairy scalp areas and quantitative comparisons with conventional electrodes in both EEG and electromyography (EMG) remain limited.MethodsWe fabricated two MN electrode types of different lengths\u2014one for EMG on hairless skin and one for EEG on the hairy scalp\u2014and compared them with conventional wet and dry electrodes. EMG was recorded during a force-matching task; EEG was assessed via somatosensory evoked potentials. We also evaluated setup/cleanup time, comfort, and pain during EEG measurement.ResultsFor EMG, MN electrodes achieved significantly higher signal-to-noise ratios than conventional electrodes. For EEG, they outperformed dry electrodes and matched wet electrodes in signal quality\u2014without using conductive gel. Although additional time was required to part hair, cleanup was faster due to the absence of gel. Pain was comparable to dry electrodes.DiscussionPEDOT:PSS-coated MN electrodes provided superior EMG signal quality and high-quality EEG signals comparable to wet electrodes even without gel. These findings suggest that PEDOT:PSS-coated MN electrodes offer a compelling balance of signal quality and user convenience, making them especially advantageous for real-world and clinical applications where time efficiency, minimal discomfort, and gel-free operation are critical.",
