      "content": "In the kinetic modeling of a chemical synapse, the reversal potential (Esyn) and conductance amplitude (gsyn) of the synapse jointly regulate the spike-induced activity of the postsynaptic neuron. We simulate two-neuron microcircuit motifs of feedforward and feedback types using random external current pulses provided only at the presynaptic neuron. For combinations of Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to an excitatory synapse, a supervised machine learning method for classification distinguishes the motifs perfectly with a score of 1.0 when using binned counts of postsynaptic spikes as the input. Strongly inhibitory combinations of these parameters result in no postsynaptic response in both types of microcircuit motifs; hence, the classifier does not improve upon a random assignment with a score of 0.5. In other domains of the parameter space spanned by Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to diminished excitation/inhibition, the classifier fails (0.5 < score < 1), indicating the challenge in identifying the nature of the synapse inferred exclusively from postsynaptic spikes. For this task, gradient boosting gives higher classification accuracies that improve with further training, compared to other classifiers explored in this study.",

      "title": "DUSP5 Downregulation in Nucleus Accumbens Core Correlates with Synaptic Plasticity and Cue-Induced Cocaine Reinstatement",
      "content": "The United States is currently facing a drug overdose epidemic, with substance use disorder (SUD) characterized by cyclical phases of drug use, withdrawal, and relapse. The nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), a brain region critical for reward and aversion behaviors, undergoes structural and functional synaptic adaptations in response to chronic drug exposure. These changes, particularly in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs), are implicated in drug-seeking behaviors and synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of dual-specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5), an phosphatase known to deactivate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), in cocaine-induced neuroplasticity. While prior research has linked other DUSP family members to various drugs of abuse, the specific role of DUSP5 in cocaine addiction remains unexplored. We hypothesized that lack of DUSP5 contributes to NAcore synaptic plasticity during cue-induced cocaine reinstatement. To test this, we employed a rat cocaine self-administration model, integrated molecular analyses, and mined publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from cocaine-treated NAcore. Our findings aim to elucidate the potential involvement of DUSP5 in cocaine-related synaptic adaptations and behavior, addressing a significant gap in the mechanistic understanding of SUD.",

      "content": "Substance use during pregnancy has been linked to various adverse outcomes in infants, including congenital disabilities, neurodevelopmental delays, and long-term effects such as learning difficulties. An additional concern is that newborns are often exposed to multiple substances in utero. The biological consequences of such exposure remain largely unknown. Zebrafish offer an exciting alternative to fill this gap and deepen our understanding of the biological impact of prenatal multidrug exposure. We utilized zebrafish's scalability to expose embryos to some of the most commonly used substances: nicotine, alcohol, opioids, and all their possible combinations. After embryonic drug exposure, we conducted a detailed behavioural analysis across three developmental stages. Our results revealed drug-specific outcomes, including both synergistic and antagonistic effects. Furthermore, we identified distinctive effects across development, highlighting potential developmental shifts and individual differences in resilience. Overall, these findings demonstrate that prenatal polydrug exposure results in complex, stage-dependent effects, sometimes antagonistic, which cannot be predicted from single-drug outcomes. Our study emphasizes the value of zebrafish as a model for investigating polydrug interactions and provides a framework for exploring biomarkers of vulnerability and resilience in offspring.",

      "content": "Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct an intriguing multiperiodic representation of space whose properties have been the subject of much theoretical speculation. Here we combine modeling with analyses of neural population data from mice and rats to show that the grid cell representation is ideally set up to decorrelate and assign easily distinguishable labels to inputs, thus acting as a pattern separation device, much like a hash function in computing rather than a global map or metric. The multiple modules of the grid cell system allow the threshold for pattern separation to be controlled. We also extend these arguments to show how grid cells can perform pattern separation in abstract and higher-dimensional spaces. This pattern separation ability may serve to enhance episodic memory in the hippocampal formation by reducing interference between similar patterns.",

      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
      "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

      "title": "Reconstructing high-resolution visual perceptual images from human intracranial electrocorticography signals",
      "content": "Objectives. Reconstruction of visual perception from brain signals has emerged as a promising research topic. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",
