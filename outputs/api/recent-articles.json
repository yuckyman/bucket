      "title": "Tau-induced ribosomal collisions impair memory through the activation of the integrated stress response",
      "content": "The formation of new long-term memories is reliant upon the spatial and temporal regulation of mRNA translation. Translational control has been demonstrated to be disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases, which exhibit impairments in both homeostatic translation and memory formation, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, the precise mechanisms by which this dysregulation occurs, as well as the pathogenic consequences of this dysregulation have yet to be described. Here we establish that FTD-associated tau mutations impair protein synthesis prior to the onset of memory impairments by slowing ribosomal elongation speed, causing ribosomes to collide upon mRNAs. We reveal that this tau-induced ribosomal collision ultimately impairs memory-associated translation through activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) via GCN2. Pharmacological prevention of this ISR activation not only rescues memory formation in the PS19 mouse model of FTD, but also attenuates neuronal death, decreases tau phosphorylation and accumulation, and improves survival. Collectively, our data elucidates a novel mechanism by which mRNA translation is impaired early in neurodegeneration, identifies several pathological phenotypes which are traceable to impairments in mRNA translation, and highlights the therapeutic potential of rescuing these translational impairments.",

      "title": "CA inhibitor 1 treatment has only transient effects on estrous cyclicity in mice",
      "content": "Approximately 45% of new HIV infections worldwide occur in women and girls and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection is limited. Long-acting PrEP such as lenacapavir may improve adherence. One barrier to PrEP usage in women and girls is impact on the menstrual cycle, though impacts of long-acting PrEP are unclear. To model the effect of lenacapavir administration on cyclicity, adult female C57Bl/6J mice were injected with CA inhibitor 1 and assessed for estrous cyclicity. Ca inhibitor 1 transiently delayed the start of the next cycle. However, Ca inhibitor 1 was associated with a higher proportion of normal length estrous cycles. Ca inhibitor 1 did not impact astrocyte immunoreactivity or chronic cellular activity in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a major regulator of the estrous cycle. These findings suggest that lenacapavir may be a viable PrEP alternative for those concerned with PrEP impacts on menstrual cycle.",

      "title": "Stimulated human cortical waves: spatiotemporal dynamics across development",
      "content": "Traveling waves of neural activity are fundamental to cortical function, yet their spatiotemporal dynamics and structural constraints remain less understood in human brain. Conventional analyses focus on network topology and spatial geometry of neural signals, with limited emphasis on wave dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions. Here, we applied a manifold-based optical flow algorithm to an open-access intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) dataset from the single-pulse stimulation cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) paradigm, enabling direct construction of high-temporal-resolution cortical neural activity velocity fields. Spatiotemporal mode decomposition revealed a hierarchical organization: large-scale plane waves (mediating global propagation) dominate, complemented by local patterns for local computation. Dominant plane wave directions correlate with underlying white matter fibre tract orientations, indicating anatomical guidance of cortical dynamics. Velocity field singularities (sources, sinks, spirals and saddles) are non-randomly distributed, associating with default mode network (DMN) hubs. We further identified a nonlinear relationship between cortical wave speed and age, with developmental phases paralleling white matter maturation and aging. Our findings link cortical wave dynamics to anatomy, functional networks, and neurodevelopment, establishing wave speed as a potential yet important biomarker for brain function and health.",

      "title": "Locomotor savings relies on attentional control of walking in older, but not younger adults",
      "content": "The ability to recall learned movements and rapidly adapt to environmental changes, known as locomotor savings, is crucial for mobility in community-dwelling older adults. However, the influence of aging on locomotor savings and the underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. Attentional compensation is a particularly relevant mechanism because the control of automatic motor behaviors like walking tend to recruit more attentional/executive resources with aging. We hypothesize that locomotor savings is diminished with age and relies on attentional rather than automatic control of walking. To test this, we compared savings of a novel walking pattern learned on a split-belt treadmill, where each leg moves at a different speed, across multiple days in 21 older and 21 younger adults. Attentional control of walking was assessed by overground dual-task walking while prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We found that older adults exhibited less locomotor savings than younger adults after practice. Older adults also relied more on attentional resources during dual-task walking. Importantly, greater locomotor savings was associated with higher attentional control of walking in older adults, suggesting that the use of attentional resources during challenging walking facilitates the recall of previously learned movements. These results indicate that cognitive compensation strategies utilizing attentional resources are important neural mechanisms modulating locomotor savings. Understanding the role of cognitive compensation in locomotor savings may inform rehabilitation design to enhance mobility in older adults ensuring movement corrections practiced in clinical settings are saved for long-term benefit in daily life.",

      "title": "ACPC-MAP: A protocol for manually aligning structural T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Images to the Anterior Commissure - Posterior Commissure plane according to clinical standards.",
      "content": "Realigning structural MR images to stereotactic AC-PC space is a standard procedure that enhances anatomical consistency both within and across neuroimaging studies, allowing for precise spatial localization and reliable cross-subject comparisons in both clinical and research contexts. However, different versions of AC-PC spaces, stemming from varying definitions of the AC-PC axis as outlined in common stereotactic atlases like Talairach and Schaltenbrand, often lead to discrepancies between the neurosurgical and neuroimaging communities. Manual realignment of structural MR images to the clinically used version of the AC-PC plane is often necessary to validate the results of automated methods or to realign the image when these methods fail. Furthermore, manual realignment provides a critical ground truth for the development of new automated tools. However, such manual interventions are typically performed in a non-standardised manner by domain experts who possess the specialized knowledge of neuroanatomy and neuroimaging required to ensure accurate alignment. To address these challenges, we have developed and validated a standardized protocol for manually realigning structural MR images to the clinically used Schaltenbrand AC-PC plane, using a set of visual criteria to ensure accurate realignment. This protocol can be used to manually align images, verify results, validate existing automated methods, or generate ground truth data for developing new automated techniques.",

      "content": "Precise control of odorant concentration is essential for reliable olfactory research, yet existing odorant delivery methods often suffer from solvent interactions and dilution from ambient air, limiting stimulus consistency in olfactory research. We developed an odor sampling bag system using Nalophan plastic to create a closed headspace with air as the carrier medium, eliminating solvent-related variability and ambient air dilution. In two independent experiments, 15 trained panelists each rated the perceived intensity of seven concentrations of benzaldehyde and 2-heptanone using both gas-sampling bags and glass jars. Bags produced higher maximum perceptual intensities (p < 0.001) and greater test-retest reliability than jars (Experiment 1: r = 0.89 vs. 0.81, p < 0.001; Experiment 2: r = 0.86 vs. 0.72, p < 0.001). Notably, the two tested odorants showed different maximum intensities in bags (p < 0.001) but not jars (p = 0.85), suggesting bags better preserve odorant-specific concentration differences. Photoionization detector measurements confirmed stable headspace concentrations over time, comparable to industry-standard Tedlar bags. This cost-effective approach offers improved stimulus control for olfactory psychophysics research.",

      "title": "LRRK2 regulates ArfGAP1 membrane localization, activity and neuronal toxicity via phosphorylation within its lipid-sensing ALPS2 motif",
      "content": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene cause late-onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing a Roc GTPase domain and a serine/threonine-directed protein kinase domain, with PD-linked mutations known to enhance LRRK2 kinase activity and neuronal toxicity. Our previous studies identified the Golgi protein, ADP-Ribosylation Factor GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (ArfGAP1), as a novel modifier of LRRK2-induced cellular toxicity, where it can serve as a GAP-like protein and a robust kinase substrate of LRRK2. Here, we further explore the phosphorylation of ArfGAP1 by LRRK2 and its functional consequences. LRRK2 mediates the robust phosphorylation of ArfGAP1 within its lipid-sensing ALPS2 motif at residues Ser284, Thr291 and Thr292. We mutated these three phosphorylation sites, either alone or combined, to create hydrophobic phospho-null or charged phospho-mimicking versions of ArfGAP1. We find that modulating ArfGAP1 phosphorylation impairs its normal capacity to induce Golgi fragmentation upon overexpression in neural cells. Blocking phosphorylation impairs ArfGAP1-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition in primary neurons and protects against the neurotoxic effects of PD-linked G2019S LRRK2. ArfGAP1 interactome analysis in neural cells identifies 114 putative interacting proteins with a proportion of these unexpectedly localized to mitochondria, including the outer membrane proteins Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) 1-3. An ArfGAP1 triple phospho-mimic displays an increased interaction with mitochondrial VDACs owing to the redistribution of ArfGAP1 from the cis-Golgi to the cytoplasm. Promoting ArfGAP1 phosphorylation also blocks the formation of Golgi-derived vesicles following mild ER stress. Our data provides evidence for a complex functional interaction between LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 that serves to regulate ArfGAP1 subcellular localization, protein interactions, activity and neuronal toxicity via LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of its membrane-binding ALPS2 motif. Our findings support additional validation of ArfGAP1 as a putative therapeutic target for modulating LRRK2-linked PD.",

      "title": "Tilted striatofugal balance and beneficial effects of facilitating mGlu4 receptor activity in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome",
      "content": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date, no approved pharmacological treatment alleviates social impairments in patients with FXS. Since D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal projection neurons (SPNs) were shown to regulate ASD-sensitive behaviors, we explored whether the balance of activity between D1- and D2-SPNs would be biased in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of FXS. We evaluated striatal function in Fmr1-/- and Fmr1+/+ mice under pharmacological challenge and performed RNAscope(R) in situ hybridization following social interaction to assess the activity of SPNs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum (DS). We evidenced a decrease in D1-SPN activity, biasing the D1/D2-SPN balance towards an excessive weight of D2-SPN outputs. We then evaluated the effects of compounds that repress D2-SPN activity on behavioral impairments in Fmr1-/- mice. Systemically facilitating mGlu4 or blocking A2A receptor activity relieved behavioral deficits in this model. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that a tilt of the D1/D2-SPN balance in Fmr1-/- mice may contribute to their social deficit by facilitating mGlu4 activity directly in the projection site of NAc D2-SPNs. Social interaction in Fmr1-/- mice was fully rescued by photopharmacological activation of mGlu4 in the ventral pallidum (VP), where NAc D2-SPNs project. This result supports our hypothesis of excessive D2-SPN outputs and highlights the contribution of the VP in controlling social behavior. In conclusion, pharmacological compounds that repress D2-SPN activity demonstrate a promising therapeutic potential to relieve ASD-like deficits in FXS.",

We present fluorescent nanodiamonds as robust, photostable, reusable, and biocompatible probes for benchmarking spatial resolution. Owing to their nanoscale dimensions and stable fluorescence, nanodiamonds act as near-ideal point-like emitters, enabling accurate characterisation of the point spread function across varying imaging conditions. We demonstrate that nanodiamond-based phantoms serve as a reliable alternative to conventional fluorescent beads embedded in agarose, while at the same time offering advantages in stability and optical properties. Our results position nanodiamond phantoms as a next-generation calibration material that bridges ease of use and reproducibility, advancing quantitative imaging and cross-platform comparability in modern fluorescence microscopy.",

      "title": "TMS-EEG Indices to Define Local Cortical Excitability Thresholds",
      "content": "Introduction - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely employed to treat various psychiatric and neurological disorders. However, TMS protocols typically rely on generalizations, particularly in selecting stimulation intensities, leading to suboptimal and variable outcomes. Combining TMS with electroencephalography (EEG) offers a potential solution by allowing direct monitoring of stimulation effects. In this study, we investigate how features of the TMS-EEG signal change with intensity to identify thresholds implying qualitative shifts in the brain response. Methods - We stimulated eight subjects at both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) with navigated TMS at 15 closely spaced intensities and measured TMS-evoked EEG responses (TMS-evoked potential, TEP) with 60 trials per intensity. TEP thresholds were identified with three methods: by selecting the intensity where the TEP peak-to-peak exceeds 6 V, or by fitting either piecewise-linear or sigmoid curves into the power spectral density (PSD) frequency components to identify nonlinear intensity behavior. Results - The identified TEP thresholds varied depending on subject, target, and identification method. In M1, the thresholds attained with the fixed-amplitude and piecewise PSD fit methods averaged around the motor threshold, and in pre-SMA around 120% of the motor threshold. The TEP thresholds yielded by the sigmoid fit method were higher in intensity, and least consistent between subjects. Conclusions - Our findings support the hypothesis that detectable changes in EEG patterns occur at specific TMS intensities. These results provide a basis for individualized stimulation dosing, potentially enhancing therapeutic efficacy and reliability. Future research should focus on refining these methods and validating their clinical applicability across diverse conditions and patient populations.",
