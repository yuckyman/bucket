      "content": "PurposeThis study examined story retelling in individuals with aphasia who scored at or above the 93.8 cutoff on the Aphasia Quotient (AQ) of the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R). The performance of these participants deemed \u201cnot aphasic by WAB\u201d (NABW) was compared with the performance of non-aphasic participants and individuals with anomic aphasia.MethodMost participants were from a test development dataset for the Brief Assessment of Transactional Success in communication in aphasia (BATS), including four groups of 16 individuals: (1) a group who tested NABW; (2) a group with anomic aphasia matched on gender, age, education, and time post-onset; (3) a group with mild anomic aphasia who scored just below the NABW cutoff; and (4) a group of non-aphasic individuals matched on gender, age, and education with the NABW group. Groups were compared on main concepts of the BATS story retelling. Groups with aphasia were also compared on the main concepts of stories retold by non-aphasic conversation partners following co-construction of stories and on self-reported scores of the impact of aphasia on everyday communication.ResultsThe results showed significant differences in the retelling of the story\u2019s main concepts between the non-aphasic control and conversation partner groups, with non-monotonic decreases in performance in comparisons of groups with and without aphasia: from non-aphasic to NABW to mildly anomic to anomic. Individuals deemed NABW (and their conversation partners) did not perform significantly better than individuals with mild anomic aphasia (and their conversation partners) on story retell main concepts. There were significant differences in the production of AphasiaBank discourse main concepts between the group with anomia and both the non-aphasic and NABW groups, but not between the non-aphasic and NABW or those with mild aphasia.ConclusionIndividuals with aphasia who scored \u201cnon-aphasic\u201d on the WAB demonstrated impairments in story retelling that align with their self-report of diminished everyday communicative functioning. This finding adds to growing support for the addition of a new measure of functional communication to the core outcome set of measures utilized in aphasia research. We propose the BATS, a measure that is sensitive across the spectrum of aphasia severity, including cases of mild and subclinical aphasia.",

      "title": "Patterns of prefrontal cortical activity associated with attention-demanding and motor aspects of dual-task walking as measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.",
      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.

      "content": "BackgroundGambling disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction sharing neurobiological features with substance use disorders, yet objective biomarkers remain limited. This study examined resting-state EEG power and applied machine learning to identify potential electrophysiological markers of GD.MethodsResting eyes-closed Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 47 individuals with GD and 32 healthy controls. Absolute and relative power across delta (1\u20134 Hz), theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (8\u201313 Hz), and beta (13\u201330 Hz) bands were quantified over eight cortical regions. Group differences and correlations with the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) were analyzed. Multiple comparisons were controlled using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier was trained to differentiate GD from controls based on EEG features.ResultsGroup differences in EEG power were subtle, with GD showing significantly higher delta power in the left temporal region (p = 0.032, d = 0.43). Within the GD group, greater gambling severity was associated with higher absolute beta power across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions (r \u2248 0.40\u20130.50, p < 0.01), and these associations remained significant after FDR correction (pFDR < 0.05). The LDA model using absolute power achieved 73.7% classification accuracy (AUC = 0.74), whereas relative power yielded near-chance accuracy (57.9%).ConclusionsGD is characterized by subtle but meaningful EEG alterations, particularly increased beta activity linked to gambling severity. Multivariate EEG patterns can distinguish GD from controls, supporting the potential of resting-state EEG as a biomarker for clinical assessment and severity monitoring in behavioral addiction.",

      "content": "IntroductionEarly life stress (ELS) has been identified as a major risk factor for the development of various disorders in adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ELS on adult brain function by focusing on the aperiodic component (exponent and offset) of neural activity\u2014a novel neurophysiological marker thought to reflect the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance.MethodsWe recruited 65 healthy adults as participants in this study. Resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded for 5 min with eyes closed. ELS was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Japanese version, National Institute of Mental Health (CTQ-JNIMH), and current psychological status was evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State\u2013Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Aperiodic components were extracted from the MEG power spectra using the FOOOF algorithm, and their relationships with CTQ-JNIMH scores were analyzed.ResultsAccording to the CTQ-JNIMH, 40% of the participants reported experiencing emotional neglect and 27.7% reported physical neglect, while reports of abuse were relatively rare. A significant negative correlation was observed between emotional neglect severity and the aperiodic offset in the left pars orbitalis, which remained significant after false discovery rate correction. In contrast, the aperiodic offset in the left pars orbitalis did not correlate with the current psychological measures (BDI and STAI).DiscussionThese findings suggest that emotional neglect in early life may induce long-lasting alterations in brain function, potentially shifting the E/I balance, as reflected by the aperiodic offset, toward increased excitability in the left pars orbitalis.",

      "title": "Glutathione metabolism as a key regulator of oxidative hippocampal injury in sepsis-associated encephalopathy: an integrated proteomics and metabolomics study",
      "content": "IntroductionSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is characterized by acute neurological dysfunction and hippocampal damage, with oxidative stress being a key driver of neuronal injury. However, the role of dysfunctional glutathione (GSH) metabolism in hippocampal injury during SAE remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the molecular and biochemical changes in the hippocampus induced by SAE through multi-omics integration (proteomics and metabolomics), thereby providing a theoretical basis for improved neuroprotective strategies.MethodsA murine SAE model was established via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Subsequent analyses included assessments of hippocampal tissue damage, microglial activation, and cognitive function in mice. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (oxidative stress markers) were detected. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), while metabolomic profiling was used to characterize metabolic changes. Multi-omics integration was conducted to reveal core regulatory networks, and mechanistic validation focused on the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and GPX4.ResultsThe CLP-induced SAE model showed significant hippocampal damage, microglial activation, cognitive deficits, and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ROS, and MDA. Proteomic analysis identified 156 DEPs, with glutathione metabolism being the most severely disrupted pathway. Metabolomic results confirmed systemic glutathione depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced levels of S-lactoylglutathione, carnitine species, and NAD+ intermediates. Multi-omics integration revealed a \u201chigh-inflammation, high-oxidation, low-metabolism\u201d triad, which is mainly regulated by the Stat1-(2-carboxypropyl)-Cysteamine-C3 interaction axis. Mechanistic validation further confirmed downregulated expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and GPX4 in CLP mice, establishing a direct link between glutathione dysregulation and neuronal apoptosis.DiscussionOur findings demonstrate that glutathione metabolism serves as a pivotal hub in the pathogenesis of SAE. The identified glutathione-related pathways provide potential therapeutic targets for alleviating oxidative stress-induced hippocampal injury in SAE, offering new insights for the clinical management of SAE-related neurological damage.",

      "title": "Associations between the brain glymphatic system and mitochondrial (dys)function: a systematic review",
      "content": "IntroductionPrevious studies have shown that the proper functioning of both mitochondria and the glymphatic system transporting metabolites are essential for brain health. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the current evidence-based data regarding the relationship between mitochondria and the glymphatic system.MethodsThis systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science were searched on June 11, 2024, for eligible studies published until June 1, 2024.ResultsOf 103 studies, six were included: two original studies and four review articles. All the included studies consistently indicated that the mitochondria and the glymphatic system are likely interconnected, with evidence suggesting several potential links between them. According to original studies, mitochondrial abnormalities in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may disrupt glymphatic system function. The included reviews highlighted REM sleep deprivation, melatonin, and inflammation as potential factors linking mitochondria and the glymphatic system.DiscussionThe relationship between mitochondria and the glymphatic system is complex. Further research is needed to clarify the precise mechanisms of interaction as the current literature is largely speculative. Existing evidence suggests that mitochondrial abnormalities are present in iNPH and IIH, conditions related to impaired CSF flow and impaired glymphatic function. In addition, sleep and melatonin potentially link mitochondrial activity and the glymphatic system function and thus offer potential avenues to ameliorate disorders associated with glymphatic dysfunction by enhancing mitochondrial activity.",

      "title": "Central effects of short-term spinal cord stimulation in postherpetic neuralgia: a longitudinal fMRI and DTI study",
      "content": "ObjectivePostherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a refractory neuropathic pain following herpes zoster reactivation, lacks clear central mechanisms for emerging therapies like short-term spinal cord stimulation (stSCS). This longitudinal study used multimodal neuroimaging to examine the effects of 14-day stSCS on brain function and white matter microstructure in PHN patients, and to identify neural correlates of clinical improvements.MethodsIn this longitudinal, single-arm, pre-post study, 17 PHN patients received 14\u202fdays of continuous stSCS. Clinical outcomes including pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), were assessed pre-stSCS and 3\u202fdays post-stSCS. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data were acquired at both time points. Longitudinal changes in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were analyzed, alongside white matter integrity via TBSS and ROI analysis of key tracts.ResultsPost-stSCS, significant improvements occurred in all clinical outcomes (Wilcoxon signed-rank, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Neuroimaging showed no DTI microstructural changes but significant fALFF increases in regions including the dorsal striatum. Notably, right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) fALFF increases correlated with NRS reductions (Spearman\u2019s r\u202f=\u202f0.71, FDR-corrected p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Baseline cingulum integrity (lower FA, higher MD/RD) predicted greater striatal fALFF changes (r\u202f=\u202f\u00b10.75, FDR-corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.02).ConclusionThese findings suggest that stSCS\u2019s early clinical benefits in PHN are mediated by rapid functional reorganization rather than immediate microstructural changes. This reorganization appears prominent within fronto-striatal circuits: specifically, mOFC functional changes correlate with analgesia, while baseline cingulum integrity predicts subsequent striatal plasticity. This provides initial mechanistic insights into stSCS and suggest that baseline brain structure could be explored as a potential biomarker for treatment response, warranting validation in larger, controlled cohorts.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate alterations in brain activity due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning (ACOP) and their relationship with clinical manifestations using static and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analyses.MethodsResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and clinical data were obtained from 31 ACOP patients and 28 healthy controls. The static ALFF value and dynamic ALFF variability were measured and compared between groups. Partial correlation analysis explored the relationships between changes in ALFF and clinical features in ACOP patients.ResultsACOP patients exhibited increased dynamic ALFF in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and decreased static ALFF in the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) compared to controls. Aberrant dynamic ALFF in the left SFG and MFG was negatively correlated with MoCA-B scores (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.430, p\u202f=\u202f0.036; r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.439, p\u202f=\u202f0.032).ConclusionACOP patients exhibited abnormal instability in intrinsic brain activity, particularly in prefrontal areas, where temporal variability in local brain activity correlates with cognitive performance. This study highlights the value of combined static and dynamic ALFF approaches in understanding brain disturbances caused by CO exposure, providing new insights into the neuropathological mechanisms of ACOP.",

      "title": "Differentiating vestibular migraine from Meniere's disease: an analysis of clinical features, videonystagmography, and caloric testing",
      "content": "ObjectiveVestibular migraine (VM) and Meniere's disease (MD) are episodic vertigo disorders with overlapping symptoms, often leading to misdiagnosis. This study aimed to identify a cost-effective diagnostic method to distinguish VM and MD.MethodsIn this retrospective study, 108 VM patients and 65 MD patients were enrolled. Clinical symptoms, interictal videonystagmography (VNG) findings, and caloric test results were analyzed and compared between the two groups.ResultsThe VM group had a significantly higher proportion of females (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in any features of interictal nystagmus, including spontaneous or positional nystagmus (all p > 0.05). However, the caloric test revealed a significantly higher proportion of canal paresis (CP) in MD patients compared to VM patients (p < 0.001).ConclusionWhile clinical symptom profiles effectively distinguish VM from MD, interictal nystagmus analysis has limited diagnostic value. The caloric test is a reliable and practical tool, as the presence of significant canal paresis strongly indicates MD over VM. Combining symptom evaluation with caloric testing offers a cost-effective strategy for the differential diagnosis of these common vestibular disorders.",
