      "title": "Human Resource Management and AI: A Contextual Transparency Database",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.03916v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI tools are proliferating in human resources management (HRM) and recruiting, helping to mediate access to the labor market. As these systems spread, profession-specific transparency needs emerging from black-boxed systems in HRM move into focus. Prior work often frames transparency technically or abstractly, but we contend AI transparency is a social project shaped by materials, meanings, and competencies of practice. This paper introduces the Talent Acquisition and Recruiting AI (TARAI) Index, situating AI systems within the social practice of recruiting by examining product functionality, claims, assumptions, and AI clarity. Built through an iterative, mixed-methods process, the database demonstrates how transparency emerges: not as a fixed property, but as a dynamic outcome shaped by professional practices, interactions, and competencies. By centering social practice, our work offers a grounded, actionable approach to understanding and articulating AI transparency in HR and provides a blueprint for participatory database design for contextual transparency in professional practice.",

      "title": "SnappyMeal: Design and Longitudinal Evaluation of a Multimodal AI Food Logging Application",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.03907v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Food logging, both self-directed and prescribed, plays a critical role in uncovering correlations between diet, medical, fitness, and health outcomes. Through conversations with nutritional experts and individuals who practice dietary tracking, we find current logging methods, such as handwritten and app-based journaling, are inflexible and result in low adherence and potentially inaccurate nutritional summaries. These findings, corroborated by prior literature, emphasize the urgent need for improved food logging methods. In response, we propose SnappyMeal, an AI-powered dietary tracking system that leverages multimodal inputs to enable users to more flexibly log their food intake. SnappyMeal introduces goal-dependent follow-up questions to intelligently seek missing context from the user and information retrieval from user grocery receipts and nutritional databases to improve accuracy. We evaluate SnappyMeal through publicly available nutrition benchmarks and a multi-user, 3-week, in-the-wild deployment capturing over 500 logged food instances. Users strongly praised the multiple available input methods and reported a strong perceived accuracy. These insights suggest that multimodal AI systems can be leveraged to significantly improve dietary tracking flexibility and context-awareness, laying the groundwork for a new class of intelligent self-tracking applications.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.03733v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This thesis introduces the Haptic-Audio Code Interface (HACI), an educational tool designed to enhance programming education for visually impaired (VI) students by integrating haptic and audio feedback to compensate for the absence of visual cues. HACI consists of a non-resource-intensive web application supporting JavaScript program development, execution, and debugging, connected via a cable to an Arduino-powered glove with six integrated haptic motors to provide physical feedback to VI programmers. Motivated by the need to provide equitable educational opportunities in computer science, HACI aims to improve non-visual code navigation, comprehension, summarizing, editing, and debugging for students with visual impairments while minimizing cognitive load. This work details HACI's design principles, technical implementation, and a preliminary evaluation through a pilot study conducted with undergraduate Computer Science students. Findings indicate that HACI aids in the non-visual navigation and understanding of programming constructs, although challenges remain in refining feedback mechanisms to ensure consistency and reliability, as well as supplementing the current functionality with a more feature-reach and customizable accessible learning experience which will allow visually impaired students to fully utilize interleaved haptic and audio feedback. The study underscores the transformative potential of haptic and audio feedback in educational practices for the visually impaired, setting a foundation for future research and development in accessible programming education. This thesis contributes to the field of accessible technology by demonstrating how tactile and auditory feedback can be effectively integrated into educational tools, thereby broadening accessibility in STEM education.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.03732v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Hyperchat AI is a novel agentic technology that enables thoughtful conversations among networked human groups of potentially unlimited size. It allows large teams to discuss complex issues, brainstorm ideas, surface risks, assess alternatives and efficiently converge on optimized solutions that amplify the group's Collective Intelligence (CI). A formal study was conducted to quantify the forecasting accuracy of human groups using Hyperchat AI to conversationally predict the outcome of Major League Baseball (MLB) games. During an 8-week period, networked groups of approximately 24 sports fans were tasked with collaboratively forecasting the winners of 59 baseball games through real-time conversation facilitated by AI agents. The results showed that when debating the games using Hyperchat AI technology, the groups converged on High Confidence predictions that significantly outperformed Vegas betting markets. Specifically, groups were 78% accurate in their High Confidence picks, a statistically strong result vs the Vegas odds of 57% (p=0.020). Had the groups bet against the spread (ATS) on these games, they would have achieved a 46% ROI against Vegas betting markets. In addition, High Confidence forecasts that were generated through above-average conversation rates were 88% accurate, suggesting that real-time interactive deliberation is central to amplified accuracy.",

The framework integrates a supervisor model for strategic oversight and a conversational model for question generation. We conducted three studies: Study 1 evaluated usability with 20 participants; Study 2 compared 121 AI interviews to 1,271 human interviews from the MediaSum dataset using NLP metrics and propensity score matching; Study 3 involved 10 interdisciplinary researchers conducting both human and AI interviews, followed by blind thematic analysis. Results across studies indicate that MimiTalk reduces interview anxiety, maintains conversational coherence, and outperforms human interviews in information richness, coherence, and stability. AI interviews elicit technical insights and candid views on sensitive topics, while human interviews better capture cultural and emotional nuances. These findings suggest that dual-agent constitutional AI supports effective human-AI collaboration, enabling replicable, scalable and quality-controlled qualitative research.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.03730v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to create transparency in modern AI models by offering explanations of the models to human users. There are many ways in which researchers have attempted to evaluate the quality of these XAI models, such as user studies or proposed objective metrics like \"fidelity\". However, these current XAI evaluation techniques are ad hoc at best and not generalizable. Thus, most studies done within this field conduct simple user surveys to analyze the difference between no explanations and those generated by their proposed solution. We do not find this to provide adequate evidence that the explanations generated are of good quality since we believe any kind of explanation will be \"better\" in most metrics when compared to none at all. Thus, our study looks to highlight this pitfall: most explanations, regardless of quality or correctness, will increase user satisfaction. We also propose that emphasis should be placed on actionable explanations. We demonstrate the validity of both of our claims using an agent assistant to teach chess concepts to users. The results of this chapter will act as a call to action in the field of XAI for more comprehensive evaluation techniques for future research in order to prove explanation quality beyond user satisfaction. Additionally, we present an analysis of the scenarios in which placebic or actionable explanations would be most useful.",

This paper proposes a role-based framework for human-centered LLM support systems, compares real deployments across domains, and identifies cross-cutting design principles: transparency, personalization, guardrails, memory with privacy, and a balance of empathy and reliability. It outlines evaluation metrics that extend beyond accuracy to trust, engagement, and longitudinal outcomes. It also analyzes risks including over-reliance, hallucination, bias, privacy exposure, and unequal access, and proposes future directions spanning unified evaluation, hybrid human-AI models, memory architectures, cross-domain benchmarking, and governance. The goal is to support responsible integration of LLMs in sensitive settings where people need accompaniment and guidance, not only answers.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.03728v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: On-device AI agents offer the potential for personalized, low-latency assistance, but their deployment is fundamentally constrained by limited memory capacity, which restricts usable context. This reduced practical context window creates a trade-off between supporting rich, stateful interactions with complex tool capabilities and maintaining on-device feasibility. We break this trade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by three synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized LoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and structured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool schemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time schema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool selection. We instantiate this framework by adapting a 3B parameter SLM to context-efficient trajectories and rigorously evaluate it against a conventional baseline on complex user tasks. Our agent matches, or exceeds, the performance of a conventional baseline while dramatically compressing context, achieving more than a 6-fold reduction in initial system prompt context and a 10- to 25-fold reduction in context growth rate based on the interaction verbosity, demonstrating that strategic context management is key to unlocking capable and persistent on-device AI.",

While large language models (LLMs) provide on-demand programming support, current applications rarely foster CT development. We present MazeMate, an LLM-powered chatbot embedded in a 3D Maze programming game, designed to deliver adaptive, context-sensitive scaffolds aligned with CT processes in maze solving and maze design. We report on the first classroom implementation with 247 undergraduates. Students rated MazeMate as moderately helpful, with higher perceived usefulness for maze solving than for maze design. Thematic analysis confirmed support for CT processes such as decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking, while also revealing limitations in supporting maze design, including mismatched suggestions and fabricated algorithmic solutions. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based scaffolding to support CT and underscore directions for design refinement to enhance MazeMate usability in authentic classrooms.",

      "content": "arXiv:2411.05712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: When trained on large-scale object classification datasets, certain artificial neural network models begin to approximate core object recognition behaviors and neural response patterns in the primate brain. While recent machine learning advances suggest that scaling compute, model size, and dataset size improves task performance, the impact of scaling on brain alignment remains unclear. In this study, we explore scaling laws for modeling the primate visual ventral stream by systematically evaluating over 600 models trained under controlled conditions on benchmarks spanning V1, V2, V4, IT and behavior. We find that while behavioral alignment continues to scale with larger models, neural alignment saturates. This observation remains true across model architectures and training datasets, even though models with stronger inductive biases and datasets with higher-quality images are more compute-efficient. Increased scaling is especially beneficial for higher-level visual areas, where small models trained on few samples exhibit only poor alignment. Our results suggest that while scaling current architectures and datasets might suffice for alignment with human core object recognition behavior, it will not yield improved models of the brain's visual ventral stream, highlighting the need for novel strategies in building brain models.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.25998v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: This overview of integrated information theory (IIT) emphasizes IIT's \"consciousness-first\" approach to what exists. Consciousness demonstrates to each of us that something exists--experience--and reveals its essential properties--the axioms of phenomenal existence. IIT formulates these properties operationally, yielding the postulates of physical existence. To exist intrinsically or absolutely, an entity must have cause-effect power upon itself, in a specific, unitary, definite and structured manner. IIT's explanatory identity claims that an entity's cause-effect structure accounts for all properties of an experience--essential and accidental--with no additional ingredients. These include the feeling of spatial extendedness, temporal flow, of objects binding general concepts with particular configurations of features, and of qualia such as colors and sounds. IIT's intrinsic ontology has implications for understanding meaning, perception, and free will, for assessing consciousness in patients, infants, other species, and artifacts, and for reassessing our place in nature.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.04593v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Many models used in artificial intelligence and cognitive science rely on multi-element patterns stored in \"slots\" - dedicated storage locations - in a digital computer. As biological brains likely lack slots, we consider how they might achieve similar functional outcomes without them by building on the neurally-inspired modern Hopfield network (MHN; Krotov & Hopfield, 2021), which stores patterns in the connection weights of an individual neuron. We propose extensions of this approach to increase its biological plausibility as a model of memory and to capture an important advantage of slot-based computation in contemporary language models. For memory, neuroscience research suggests that the weights of overlapping sparse ensembles of neurons, rather than a dedicated individual neuron, are used to store a memory. We introduce the K-winner MHN, extending the approach to ensembles, and find that within a continual learning regime, the ensemble-based MHN exhibits greater retention of older memories, as measured by the graded sensitivity measure d', than a standard (one-neuron) MHN. Next, we consider the powerful use of slot-based memory in contemporary language models. These models use slots to store long sequences of past inputs and their learned encodings, supporting later predictions and allowing error signals to be transported backward in time to adjust weights underlying the learned encodings of these past inputs. Inspired by these models' successes, we show how the MHN can be extended to capture both of these important functional outcomes. Collectively, our modeling approaches constitute steps towards understanding how biologically plausible mechanisms can support computations that have enabled AI systems to capture human-like abilities that no prior models have been able to achieve.",

These models have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python package for our proposed method to empower researchers to apply it in the analysis of their datasets directly, without prior knowledge of convex optimization.",

      "title": "BTTDA: Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis for Brain-Computer Interfacing",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.04292v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow direct communication between the brain and external devices, frequently using electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity. Dimensionality reduction and structured regularization are essential for effectively classifying task-related brain signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and motor imagery (MI) rhythms. Current tensor-based approaches, such as Tucker and PARAFAC decompositions, often lack the flexibility needed to fully capture the complexity of EEG data. This study introduces Block-Term Tensor Discriminant Analysis (BTTDA): a novel tensor-based and supervised feature extraction method designed to enhance classification accuracy by providing flexible multilinear dimensionality reduction. Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a novel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme to iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature representation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant PARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and MI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework. Benchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the traditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art performance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and PARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52% > 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more efficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power. This offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI and broader neuroimaging applications.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.04174v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.",

      "title": "Simple 3D Pose Features Support Human and Machine Social Scene Understanding",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.03988v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about others' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues like whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet, the computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and social interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI vision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose information to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI vision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth estimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video clips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict human social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly, 3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that key social information is available in explicit body position but not in the learned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise embeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the critical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a compact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and direction of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors matched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly improved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with their embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were represented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability to match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D pose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.04539v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Functional brain graphs are often characterized with separate graph-theoretic or spectral descriptors, overlooking how these properties covary and partially overlap across brains and conditions. We anticipate that dense, weighted functional connectivity graphs occupy a low-dimensional latent geometry along which both topological and spectral structures display graded variations. Here, we estimated this unified graph representation and enabled generation of dense functional brain graphs through a graph transformer autoencoder with latent diffusion, with spectral geometry providing an inductive bias to guide learning. This geometry-aware latent representation, although unsupervised, meaningfully separated working-memory states and decoded visual stimuli, with performance further enhanced by incorporating neural dynamics. From the diffusion modeled distribution, we were able to sample biologically plausible and structurally grounded synthetic dense graphs.",

A key to this success has been the implementation of crucial features found in biological neural networks: neurons as units of information transfer, non-linear activation functions that enable general function approximation, and complex architectures vital for attentional processes. However, standard deep learning models rely on biologically implausible error propagation algorithms and struggle to accumulate knowledge incrementally. While, the precise learning rule governing synaptic plasticity in biological systems remains unknown, recent discoveries in neuroscience could fuel further progress in AI.

      "content": "arXiv:2511.04047v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.",
