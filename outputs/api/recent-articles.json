      "content": "Infant brain networks mature rapidly and nonlinearly, yet cross-network comparisons of developmental trajectories remain rare. We introduce cross-network non-linear trajec- tory characterization (CNTC), which fits cubic polynomials to age-related change in three spatial measures-network- averaged spatial similarity (NASS), network strength, and network size derived from resting-state fMRI. Using 137 scans from 74 neurotypical infants spanning 0-6 months of age, we estimated networks via group ICA, modeled age trajectories within each network, and then contrasted coefficients across networks. Across seven canonical sys- tems, trajectories showed robust age effects. Cross network differences were dominated by linear terms, with selective quadratic effects and few cubic effects. Visual and cerebellar systems exhibited the steepest NASS slopes and pronounced increases in strength and size, whereas motor/attention changes were more gradual. CNTC provides a compact, coefficient-level summary of inter-network maturation and a basis for benchmarking atypical development in future work.",

      "title": "Subcortical control of reaching in humans",
      "content": "Accurate visually guided reaching requires transformation of target-related photoreceptor responses into precisely coordinated activation of trunk and arm muscles. The cerebral cortex is widely believed to compute the requisite kinematic and musculoskeletal dynamics strategies in humans (1-3), even though vertebrates lacking a cerebral cortex achieve sophisticated visuomotor control (4-6), and brainstem circuits executing coordinated eye and head gaze shifts perform analogous sensorimotor computations in non-human primates (7). Here we used a visuomotor reaching task that yields extremely rapid, 'express', target-directed muscle activations (8-10) to test whether a putative subcortical sensorimotor network can compute musculoskeletal dynamics to initiate reaching in humans. We found coordinated express visuomotor responses (EVRs) in task-relevant shoulder, elbow, and bi-articular muscles that reflected both starting posture and target direction in similar patterns to longer latency, presumably cortically mediated, muscle responses. When the task goal was to reach away from the stimulus (i.e. an 'anti-reach'; 11) the EVR involved coordinated muscle activation to initiate the hand toward the stimulus location, opposite to the subsequent goal-directed response. The results suggest a unified theory of visuomotor control for reaching and gaze shifts, in which subcortical systems compute musculoskeletal dynamics based on sensory target information and cortically derived context. The results imply that the transformation from motor goals in extrapersonal space into musculoskeletal dynamics can be performed by neural circuitry in humans that does not involve the sensorimotor cortex.",

      "title": "Two views of the brain are reconciled by a unifying principle of maximal information processing",
      "content": "There is selective pressure on brains to maximize computational capacity and adaptability in an unpredictable world. Prior work suggests that this demand is satisfied by a regime called criticality, which has emerged as a powerful, unifying framework for understanding how computation can arise in biological systems. However, this framework has been confined to high-dimensional network models. At first glance, this appears irreconcilable with many of the foundational, low dimensional dynamical models that have driven progress in theoretical and computational neuroscience for a century. If criticality is a universal principle, then all models that accurately capture significant aspects of brain function should be constrained by the same fact. Lacking a definition of criticality in low-dimensional dynamical systems, this has been impossible to evaluate. Here, we develop a mathematical definition of criticality that transcends dimensionality by recognizing temporal scale invariance as analogous to spatial scale invariance that defines criticality in large systems. We demonstrate that there are two mechanistically distinct sources of criticality at bifurcations, one deterministic and one that emerges from noise fluctuations. Further, we show that some but not all canonical bifurcations in neural models exhibit criticality, and only a subset of these are biologically plausible. We conduct numerical analyses demonstrating that information processing capacity peaks at critical bifurcations, and evaluate which historically influential neural models contain these bifurcations. Our results establish criticality as a universal neurobiological principle that is accessible to systems of any dimensionality. This unifies disparate modeling approaches under a single computational framework and suggests that optimal information processing emerges not from model-specific mechanisms but from fundamental properties of critical dynamics themselves.",

      "title": "Linking White-Matter Development to Clinical Variation in Autism: Longitudinal Normative Modelling of FA in the EU-AIMS LEAP Cohort",
      "content": "Background: Autism is characterised by marked neurobiological and clinical heterogeneity, which often limits the sensitivity of traditional group comparisons. Longitudinal normative modelling offers a way to capture heterogeneity and to describe an individual's brain-behaviour relationships beyond diagnostic labels. Methods: We analysed diffusion MRI scans from 3 waves of the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP). Using normative models of white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) we computed individual deviations relative to age typical norms. Our sample included 544 different individuals across all waves (Wave 1: 344 [autistic 189]; Wave 2: 297 [autistic 162]; Wave 3: 226 [autistic 145]), aged 7-37 years, with mean intervals of ~1.5 years (W1-W2) and ~6 years (W1-W3). We first tested for group level differences between autism and no-autism and then examined the associations with sensory, adaptive, cognitive, and behavioural measures across development within the autism group. Results: Although mean FA differences between autistic and non-autistic participants were not significant, correlations between individual differences in FA and behaviour across repeated measurements yielded moderate but reproducible results. The cingulum bundle, uncinate fasciculus, callosal fibres (genu and splenium), and the superior longitudinal fasciculus were among the most frequently identified pathways associated with clinical traits. For these circuits, FA values were higher in individuals with better adaptive functioning (VABS) and lower in those reporting sensory processing (SSP) difficulties. Findings were mixed for associations between FA and symptom severity (ADOS). The largest cross-sectional signal appeared at Wave 2, and although some of the same circuitry re-appeared over about 7.5 years from Wave 1 to Wave 3, effect sizes remained modest and variable, consistent with heterogeneity and power differences across waves, but still pointing to a stable white matter tract pattern. Conclusions: Autism's white-matter organisation reflects a dimensional and individually patterned architecture rather than a categorical distinction. Stable, person-specific deviations from shared neurodevelopmental pathways are linked to behavioural variation among autistic individuals. Longitudinal normative modelling therefore provides a practical approach to understand and quantify this heterogeneity.",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

      "title": "Altered descending modulation in patients with chronic primary low back pain assessed by non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy",
      "content": "Objective. Low back pain (LBP) is a significant public health issue. Despite current medical imaging and neurophysiological tests, up to 90% of patients lack a clear cause, leading to a diagnosis of chronic primary LBP (CPLP). Non-invasive functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was employed to detect spinal cord dysfunctions by recording perispinal neurovascular response (NVR). Approach. In a prospective study of 71 CPLP patients and 65 healthy age-matched volunteers, pain maps, visual analog scale (VAS), body mass index (BMI), posterior tibial nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and lumbar and cervical NVRs triggered by non-noxious electrical stimulation of this nerve were assessed. Main results. CPLP patients exhibited a 53.29% reduction in NVR amplitude at the cervical level compared to the controls, with no significant difference at the lumbar level. CPLP patients compared to controls show a rise time of 6.64% and 5.14% larger in cervical and lumbar recordings, respectively, but a duration of 10.11% and 5.32% shorter, respectively. Posterior tibial NCV was within normal clinical range in both groups. In CPLP patients, VAS scores were negatively correlated with NVR rise time, amplitude, and duration at the lumbar site, as well as with rise time and duration at the cervical site (p < 0.05). Additionally, BMI showed a negative correlation with all NVR parameters at both recording sites in CPLP patients, but not in controls (p < 0.05). Significance. This is the first report of perispinal NVR dysfunction in patients with CPLP. Its results suggest a loss of inhibitory regulation in the lumbar spinal cord in CPLP patients and demonstrate the potential of fNIRS to detect and quantify spinal cord neurovascular dysfunctions. For the first time, perispinal NVR dysfunction is reported in CPLP patients, suggesting an altered descending modulation system at the lumbar spinal cord.",

      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "title": "On collective behavior in C. elegans",
      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "Deployable electrode arrays for brain interfaces: structural reconfiguration strategies for long-term stability and high-fidelity recording\u2014a review",
      "content": "Objective. Neural electrode arrays, as essential tools for recording and stimulating neural tissues, significantly impact therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders through deep brain stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and brain-computer interfaces. Despite considerable advancements, the efficiency and longevity of neural electrode arrays are compromised by brain micromotion, induced by physiological activities such as cardiac pulsation and respiration. The mechanical mismatch between rigid electrode arrays and soft neural tissue generates persistent stresses at the electrode-tissue interface, triggering tissue damage, inflammatory responses, encapsulation, and ultimately electrode failure. Deployable neural electrode arrays, characterized by structural reconfiguration after implantation, have emerged to address these challenges. Deployment mechanisms, including unfolding, expanding, unrolling, or ejecting electrode arms from an initially compact configuration, reduce insertion trauma, maximize spatial coverage, and mitigate brain micromotion effects, thereby enhancing long-term stability and recording fidelity. Approach. This review provides the first comprehensive analysis of deployable intracortical and electrocorticography electrode arrays, emphasizing their design principles, deployment mechanisms, mechanical performance, advantages, and limitations. Main results. This review fills a critical gap in the existing neural electrode literature by transitioning the focus from traditional geometric and material considerations to advanced structural reconfiguration strategies. Significance. An understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of these deployment strategies provides essential insights and future directions for optimizing neural electrode technologies.",
