      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "Non-invasive prediction of conduction velocities in the human brain from MRI-derived microstructure features at 7 Tesla",
      "content": "The conduction velocity of neuronal signals along axons is a key neurophysiological property that can be altered in various disease processes. While cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) can be measured in presurgical assessment to provide information about conduction delay between a subset of brain regions, it is currently not possible to efficiently and systematically estimate conduction velocity in vivo across the whole brain. Given the established link between conduction velocity and axon morphology (most notably axon diameter but also myelination), mapping a reliable and quantitative metric linked to axon properties could fill the gap of inferring conduction velocity across the entire human brain. By integrating multiple MRI-derived microstructural measures - including axon radius, axonal water fraction, extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivity, and longitudinal relaxation time - and conduction velocity estimates obtained from a large database of CCEPs, we developed a whole-brain prediction model of conduction velocity. Our multivariate MRI-based model explained 29% of variance in neurophysiological conduction velocity, making it possible to partially predict whole-brain conduction velocity and delay matrices along connections for which no direct measurement is commonly available from epilepsy surgery investigations. This integrative MRI-based approach could provide a non-invasive framework for comprehensively characterising conduction delays in vivo across the human brain white matter.",

      "title": "Palmitoylation of death receptor p75NTR contributes to Alzheimer's Disease progression by regulating APP trafficking and degradation",
      "content": "Although protein palmitoylation has been associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), it remains unclear whether or how palmitoylation of specific proteins contributes to any of the pathological features of AD. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) contributes to AD progression by regulating the intracellular trafficking and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). p75NTR is palmitoylated at a juxtamembrane cysteine but it is currently unknown whether this has any effect on its role in AD. Here, we report that 5xFAD mice, an animal model of AD, expressing a palmitoylation-deficient mutant of p75NTR (p75C281A) display significantly attenuated neuropathology and cognitive deficits. p75C281A showed enhanced internalization, trafficking to Rab5/Rab7 endosomes and lysosomal-mediated degradation. In mutant p75C281A neurons, APP displayed accelerated co-internalization with p75NTR, increased trafficking to late endosomes and lysosome, and enhanced degradation, thereby limiting neuronal Abeta; production. Interestingly, the brain of 5xFAD mice shows increased levels of p75NTR palmitoylation. These results indicate that palmitoylation of p75NTR enhances its stability and, indirectly, that of APP by reducing their trafficking to the lysosome, resulting in increased Abeta; accumulation and neuropathology in the AD brain. Selective inhibitors of p75NTR palmitoylation may find applications in the treatment of AD.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "content": "We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

      "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease is related to imbalanced stopping-related cortical activity",
      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",
