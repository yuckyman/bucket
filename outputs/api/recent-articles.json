      "title": "Cross-Species Cortical Geometry Reveals Conserved Gradients Across Primates and Human-Specific Expansion",
      "content": "The primate cerebral cortex, characterized by its complex structural geometry, underlies advanced cognitive functions and represents a defining feature distinguishing primates from other mammals. However, cross-species patterns of cortical geometry and the links between human cortical geometry and transcriptional architecture remain poorly understood. We developed a geometry-based cross-species cortical alignment framework to systematically investigate the similarities and differences in structural connectivity and cortical expansion characteristics among macaques, chimpanzees, and humans, and additionally explored the transcriptional underpinnings of human cortical geometry. Our analysis revealed conserved spatial patterns of cortical geometric features across species, providing the foundation for constructing a cross-species structural common space to support the alignment framework. We found that primary sensory, somatomotor, and face-selective regions exhibited high structural connectivity similarity across species, whereas prefrontal and parietal association cortices displayed significant divergence. We also identified disproportionate cortical expansion in the default mode network, with a consistent expansion trend across different evolutionary lineages in primates. Furthermore, neuroimage-transcription analysis indicated that cortical geometric features were correlated with transcriptional profiles enriched in neurodevelopmental and connectivity-related pathways. These results highlight a conserved yet hierarchically differentiated organization of the cerebral cortex in primates, providing new insights into the biological basis of human brain evolution.",

      "title": "Non-invasive modulation of brain activity and behavior by transcranial radio frequency stimulation",
      "content": "Achieving non-invasive targeting and modulation of deep brain tissue by external stimuli remains a crucial goal in the advancement of state-of-the-art neurotechnology. Radio frequency (RF) energy fields, in the microwave range (300 MHz - 300 GHz), inherently exhibit effective tissue penetration. Upon absorption by tissue, these fields can induce localized thermal effects, thereby modulating neuronal activity. Integrating these principles, we present an original non-invasive brain stimulation method: Transcranial Radio Frequency Stimulation (TRFS). We provide in vivo proof-of-concept of TRFS efficacy in murine models, demonstrating TRFS's ability to: 1) suppress baseline neuronal activity when applied to the intact brain (TRFS pristine mode), and 2) selectively excite neural circuits in regions with prior overexpression of the thermosensitive TRPV1 ion channel (TRFS RF-genetics mode). We demonstrate these modulatory effects, using both neural activity monitoring and behavioral assays, by applying 3-25 W of RF energy at 945 MHz through custom-designed antennas that enable selective stimulation of the mouse brain while minimizing off-target effects on the body. Neural activity was monitored using GCaMP fiber photometry in head-fixed in vivo preparations, and behavioral changes were assessed via a rotation test in freely moving mice. These findings suggest that TRFS is a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technique with potential applications in the treatment of diverse neurological and psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Chromatin Disruption After Prenatal Hypoxia Predicts Lasting Neuron Deficits",
      "content": "Prenatal exposure to transient hypoxia can result in various developmental disabilities presumably by disrupting normal neurodevelopmental processes, even in milder injuries without detectable cell death or structural damage1,2. Emerging evidence suggests that disruption of the epigenome may be one of the most critical consequences of prenatal brain exposure to hypoxia3-8. However, the cell-type-selective effects of hypoxia on the developing brain's transcriptome and epigenome remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that immediately after hypoxia, transcriptional and chromatin disruptions occur in all cell types, consistent with the energy deficit dynamics caused by prenatal hypoxia. Unexpectedly, we identify a selective dissociation of transcriptional and chromatin regulation in glutamatergic neurons after hypoxia. Genes neighboring sites of differential chromatin accessibility, but not differential gene expression, correlate with structural and functional deficits in glutamatergic neurons one month after the injury. Our approach reveals novel, shared, and cell-type-specific changes that reflect potential short- and long-term consequences of the hypoxic response. Together, these data provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to lasting changes in the epigenome following an injury to the developing brain, resulting in long-term functional deficits.",

      "title": "Prenatal maternal stress is associated with increased sensitivity to neuropathic pain and sex-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic dynamics in the prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Prenatal maternal stress (PNS) is a common early-life adversity. PNS has been linked to greater vulnerability to chronic pain in the offspring. PNS results in increased hypersensitivity after Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, a common rodent model for chronic neuropathic pain. These behavioral effects are accompanied by altered levels of enzymes that regulate DNA methylation in the frontal cortex. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group onto cytosine bases of cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites in the genome, is an epigenetic mechanism by which life experiences can reprogram gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated regions that might contribute to the increased pain sensitivity following nerve injury in adulthood. Prior studies indicate widespread, sex-specific transcriptomic changes and numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the frontal cortex following PNS and nerve injury. Here we performed genome wide DNA methylation and transcriptome-wide RNAseq analysis in the frontal cortex of male and female mice that underwent PNS, CCI or both. Our analysis revealed sex-dependent changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, including in pathways related to neuronal and brain development, axonogenesis and synaptic regulation. The effect of DNA methylation on mRNA expression was tested in a subset of target genes. These studies suggest a role for DNA methylation in embedding increased risk for chronic pain in adulthood associated with early-life adversity.",

      "content": "The human brain's capacity to imagine visual scenes from memory is thought to rely on the medial temporal subsystem of the default mode network (MT-DMN), yet the neural codes supporting this ability remain poorly understood. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with vision and language artificial intelligence models to characterize neural codes during autobiographical imagination. Fifty participants imagined reexperiencing twenty natural scenarios while undergoing fMRI, when cued by generic text prompts (e.g., wedding, exercising, driving). Individual scenes were modeled using Stable Diffusion to generate personalized synthetic images from verbal descriptions of the scenarios imagined, collected beforehand. These depictions were then transformed into image-recognition network embeddings. Representational Similarity Analysis revealed that the MT-DMN encoded the participant-specific representational structure of image embeddings, even when controlling for semantic features derived from a large language model. This effect was absent in other networks and during reading without imagination, identifying the MT-DMN as a core substrate for the visual reconstruction of autobiographical experiences.",

      "title": "Distinct developmental trajectories of externally- and internally-generated hippocampal sequences and assemblies",
      "content": "The hippocampus generates cognitive maps through two distinct mechanisms: external representations anchored to environmental landmarks and internal sequences integrating self-referenced information. In adult CA1, these functions segregate radially, with deep cells processing external cues and superficial cells handling internal representations. This anatomical organization suggests that developmental processes constrain the formation of these functionally distinct circuits. However, the developmental timeline for the emergence of these two types of hippocampal representations remains unknown. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice during the third postnatal week, we investigated when internal versus external hippocampal representations emerge. We recorded from deep and superficial CA1 layers while mice ran on treadmills that are bare or enriched with tactile cues, addressing the challenge of tracking cells across sessions. Internal sequences emerge during the mid-fourth postnatal week, following the development of cue-based representations. These sequences initially encode elapsed time before evolving to integrate run distance, arising after rest cell assemblies as spatial coding and functional connectivity networks stabilize. These findings identify the mid fourth postnatal week as a critical developmental milestone marking the establishment of a balanced integration between external landmark-based and internal self-referenced spatial representations. This transition period may constitute a vulnerable developmental window during which disruptions could predispose to disorders characterised by altered cognitive maps.",
