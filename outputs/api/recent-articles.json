      "title": "Distributed neural dynamics underlie the shift from movement preparation to execution",
      "content": "Dissociating the neural mechanisms of movement preparation from those of execution across the brain is fundamental to understanding motor control. Invasive recordings in primary motor cortex (M1) indicate that shared neural populations support both phases by unfolding within orthogonal subspaces or \"manifolds\", yet whether and how these dynamics evolve across the broader set of brain regions involved in memory-guided skilled action remains poorly understood. Here, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) data obtained during a memory-guided delayed finger-sequence task to track fast population dynamics across M1, premotor cortices, and the hippocampus. Linear discriminant analysis decoding of sequence-specific preparatory and execution patterns revealed a transition from preparation to execution patterns across all regions prior to movement onset. Importantly, the onset of execution exhibited region-specific timing, with M1 shifting last, {approx} 100 ms before the first button press, consistent with the established cortical motor hierarchy. Low-dimensional trajectories showed that preparatory and execution states occupied distinct manifolds, yet were not fully orthogonal, suggesting partial overlap in tuning. MEG dynamics were dominated by peri-movement phase activity in primary motor and premotor regions. Nevertheless, above-chance sequence decoding was recoverable from all motor and premotor regions during execution, and in M1 during preparation. The state shift and the decoding accuracy was driven by distributed modulations across multiple frequency bands, indicating that full-band population dynamics carry richer information than band-limited features alone. These results demonstrate that non-invasive MEG can resolve continuous, hierarchical neural state transitions in the human brain in the context of memory-guided movement control. They offer mechanistic insight into distributed motor-related brain dynamics and support developing brain-computer-interfaces that incorporate signals from multiple brain regions beyond the primary motor cortex.",

      "title": "Activation of cannabinoid receptor CB1 leads to aberrant myelination in development",
      "content": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has a widespread role in the development and function of the central nervous system (CNS). Cannabinoid receptors like CB1 and CB2 can be activated with exogenous cannabinoids most popularly known as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabis and cannabidiol (CBD). The components of the ECS are expressed early in fetal development, and prenatal exposure to cannabis can lead to structural changes in white matter. White matter is composed of neuronal axons ensheathed in myelin, a lipid-rich insulation that facilitates saltatory conduction and maintains axon integrity. In the CNS, myelin is made by specialized glial cells called oligodendrocytes (OLs), which in addition to neurons also express components of the ECS. However, while several studies have focused on how the ECS regulates neuronal development, there is a limited understanding of its impact on OL development or myelin formation. Therefore, our current study set out to understand how pharmacological activation of the ECS alters OL differentiation and myelin formation in vivo. We administered WIN 55,212-2 (WIN 55), a CB1 and CB2 agonist, to larval zebrafish and longitudinally analyzed OL development and myelination in vivo. Interestingly, we observed an increase in non-axonal ensheathments in the spinal cord, which appeared to be surrounding neuronal cell bodies. These non-axonal ensheathments were dependent on CB1, as the addition of WIN 55 in a global CB1 mutant prevented this phenotype. Furthermore, this ectopic cell body ensheathment occurred independently from normal myelination processes, as individual OLs did not exhibit changes in the number of myelin sheaths, sheath length, or total myelin output. This study shows that activation of CB receptors in vivo leads to increased non-axonal ensheathment without significantly changing OL differentiation or normal myelin formation. Future studies can further investigate the pathways that drive this phenotype to better understand how exogenous cannabinoid activation can regulate the precision of oligodendrocyte ensheathment.",

      "title": "Modularity in the DCC extracellular domain elicits distinct effects on axon guidance",
      "content": "Complex neuronal circuits arise from a small set of cell-surface receptors that position neurons, promote axon extension, and define synaptic connections. A central receptor is Deleted in Colon Cancer (DCC), which mediates both short- and long-range axon guidance and confines migrating neurons to the central nervous system. DCC's versatility reflects its ability to interact at distinct sites of its extracellular domain with two ligands, Netrin-1 and Draxin, which also bind to each other. Alternative splicing further alters the Netrin-1 binding site and modulates affinity. By generating two mouse lines with mutations that selectively impair DCC binding to Netrin-1 and/or Draxin, we show that molecular modularity within the DCC extracellular domain is essential for precise circuit assembly. An eight-amino acid insertion in the DCClong isoform is required for Netrin-1-dependent long-range commissural axon guidance in the spinal cord. Conversely, isoleucine 372 in the Draxin binding site enables DCC clustering and is necessary for all known DCC functions, including axon guidance in the spinal cord and retina and neuronal migration in the brainstem. Draxin also supports long-range commissural guidance, but mutations in its binding site cause stronger defects. These results underscore how DCC's distinct modules drive specific developmental responses.",

      "title": "Pre-clinical validation of a novel AAV-mediated gene therapy for KCNV2 retinopathy improves visual function in a mouse model and expression in patient organoids",
      "content": "Voltage-gated (Kv) potassium channels are critical for neuronal physiology, and their dysfunction can lead to serious consequences. For example, mutations in the silent modulatory Kv8.2 subunit are known to cause irreversible inherited blindness (KCNV2 retinopathy). This is a currently incurable condition that causes lifelong visual loss, reduced visual acuity, photoaversion, night blindness and abnormal colour vision, alongside a distinctive supernormal electrophysiological (ERG) retinal response to light. In this study, we demonstrate that AAV-mediated gene replacement therapy delivering a codon-optimised human KCNV2 gene subretinally into Kv8.2 knock-out mice significantly restores retinal function. Treated mice exhibited improved ERG responses and correct expression of KCNV2 and its encoded Kv8.2 protein in photoreceptors. Recovery of visually guided scotopic and photopic optomotor responses to wildtype levels was achieved at lower vector doses, highlighting dose-dependent efficacy. Furthermore, treatment of human retinal organoids derived from a KCNV2 patient iPSC line resulted in substantial Kv8.2 protein rescue. This work provides the first preclinical proof-of-concept for the safety and therapeutic potential of gene therapy for KCNV2 retinopathy, laying a strong foundation for future clinical trials.",

      "title": "Rac1 contributes to brain connectivity impairments and neuropsychiatric disorders in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex",
      "content": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, leading to constitutive activation of the mTOR complex 1 pathway. Patients commonly present with epilepsy and TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TANDs), including intellectual disability and anxiety. Our previous work identified anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants, characterized by enhanced thigmotaxis. We found that anxiety-like behavior in tsc2vu242 zebrafish mutants was rescued by Rac1 inhibitors. These findings prompted further investigation into Rac1 signaling in the context of TSC pathology. Using G-LISA and FRET live imaging, we confirmed elevated Rac1 activity in the mutant brains. Rac1 activity was reduced following NSC23766 and EHT1864 treatment. Compared to wild-type controls, Rac1 activity in mutants was elevated by 50% in untreated animals, and reduced by ~30-40% after Rac1 inhibitors. Moreover, aberrant connectivity between brain hemispheres that correlated with anxiety before was restored after Rac1 inhibition. Transcriptomic profiling revealed 1,260 DEGs between homozygous and heterozygous tsc2vu242 zebrafish. Rac1 inhibition restored the expression of approximately 1,000 genes toward wild-type levels. KEGG pathway analysis identified significant enrichment in mTOR signaling and focal adhesion, while GO terms highlighted processes including axon guidance, axonogenesis, and neuronal projection. Collectively, our findings support a functional role for Rac1 in TSC pathology, linking cytoskeletal dysregulation with aberrant axon development and anxiety-like behavior. Rac1 inhibition emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue for modulating both brain structure and function in TSC-associated anxiety.",

      "title": "Spatiotemporal Network Dynamics Reveal Alzheimer's Disease Progression",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive disruptions in large-scale brain networks that precede cognitive decline, yet conventional functional connectivity analyses often fail to detect disruptions in coordination among large-scale brain networks that may be critical for early detection. This study leverages quasi periodic patterns (QPPs) and complex principal component analysis (cPCA) to characterize spatiotemporal network alterations across longitudinally stable (normal cognitive, mild cognitive impairment, dementia of Alzheimer's type) and transitioning (normal cognitive to mild cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment to dementia of Alzheimer's type) cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using resting state fMRI. QPPs were used to derive recurrent spatiotemporal templates and network integrity measures at the intrinsic connectivity network level, while cPCA decomposed Hilbert transformed time series into complex valued patterns that capture amplitude and phase relationships. Nonparametric group comparisons revealed a structured trajectory in which limbic, subcortical, and higher cognition networks, including triple network components, are affected early, followed by progressive disruption in visual, cerebellar, sensorimotor, and additional triple network systems. Transitioning cohorts showed many of these alterations before formal diagnostic conversion, indicating that spatiotemporal signatures carry preclinical information. QPP based metrics were particularly sensitive to limbic and subcortical degradation, whereas cPCA emphasized changes in higher order, visual, and cerebellar patterns, revealing complementary aspects of the same underlying pathology. These findings extend prior QPP only work and highlight the utility of combining QPP and cPCA based measures as a dynamic, network-level biomarker framework for AD progression. with potential applications in early detection, characterizing disease trajectories, and treatment monitoring.",

It is possible to download\nall files in a zip folder that will be called \u2018osfstorage-archive.zip\u2019 when\ndownloaded. But as the OSF supports a nested folder structure, you might miss a\nfolder, and you will quickly end up with \u2018osfstorage-archive (1).zip\u2019, \u2018osfstorage-archive\n(2).zip\u2019, etc. Unzipping these archives creates a lot of files without the\norganized folder structure, in folders with meaningless names, making it\ndifficult to understand where files are. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The\nosf_file_download function in Papercheck </span></b></h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We have added\na new function to our R package \u2018<a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/\">Papercheck</a>\u2019 that will download all files and\nfolders in an OSF repository. It saves all files by recreating the folder\nstructure from the OSF in your download folder. Just install Papercheck, load\nthe library, and use the osf_file_download function to grab all files on the OSF:</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: courier;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">devtools::install_github(\"scienceverse/papercheck\")<br /></span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">library(papercheck)<br /></span></b><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">osf_file_download(\"6nt4v\")</span></b></span></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></b></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">All files\nwill be downloaded to your working directory. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Are you feeling\nFOMO for missing out on the <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/open-research-summer-school-2025\">King Open\nResearch Summer School</a> that is going on these days, where <a href=\"https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/sajedeh-rasti\">Sajedeh Rasti</a> talked\nabout Preregistration, and <a href=\"https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/cristian-mesquida-caldentey\">Cristian\nMesquida</a> will give a workshop on using Papercheck?

Make sure to install the latest version of Papercheck (0.0.0.9050)\nto get access to this new function.
