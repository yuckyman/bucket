      "title": "Neural correlation between swallowing motor imagery and execution: an EEG analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The relationship between swallowing motor imagery (MI) and actual swallowing remains unclear, leading to a lack of physiological basis for the application of swallowing imagery-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) paradigms in rehabilitation. This research explored the link between swallowing execution and imagery, aiming to optimize BCI applications for swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia. Approach. Thirty healthy participants performed swallowing MI and saliva swallowing tasks under video cues, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 64 channels and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the suprahyoid muscles were recorded. This study investigates swallowing onset detection using EMG, and explores neural dynamics during swallowing imagery and execution through EEG-based time\u2013frequency analysis, functional connectivity analysis, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (sample entropy (SampEn)). Main Results. The results revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the central region (CPz, CP1\u2013CP4) and parietal region (Pz, P1\u2013P4) for both swallowing MI and actual swallowing. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0102). The ERD phenomenon during swallowing imagery was more similar to that during the pharyngeal stage, with a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0139). Functional connectivity analysis revealed greater activation of the central region during swallowing imagery than during actual swallowing. In terms of SampEn, swallowing motor execution exhibited higher signal complexity and dynamic characteristics compared to imagery. Significance. This study highlights the similarity in neural activation between swallowing imagery and execution, particularly in the central and parietal regions, supporting the application of the swallowing imagery paradigm in these regions for rehabilitation. Further research is required to enhance BCI applications in swallowing disorders.",

      "content": "Aging is the major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease, yet the mechanisms linking physiological aging to brain dysfunction remain unclear. Because telomere erosion is a hallmark of aging, we examined its impact on glial and neuronal physiology. Telomere shortened mice showed lipofuscinosis, hypomyelination, microglial atrophy, and cognitive deficits. Single nuclei RNA-seq revealed accelerated glial aging, elevated microglial senescence pathways, and impaired oligodendrocyte functions. Inducing senescence in human iPSC derived microglia with shortened telomeres identified soluble DLK1 as a novel senescence associated ligand. sDLK1 was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of telomere shortened and naturally aged mice, and this increase was eliminated by microglial depletion. AAV delivery of sDLK1 in vivo caused hypomyelination and blocked oligodendrocyte lineage progression, demonstrating the detrimental nature of excessive sDLK1. In human iPSC systems, sDLK1 impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and altered calcium signaling in excitatory neurons. These findings identify microglial senescence as a core consequence of telomere shortening and reveal sDLK1 as a microglia-derived senescence ligand that drives oligodendrocyte and neuronal dysfunction in aging.",

      "title": "Persistent enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability induced by transient divalent cation depletion",
      "content": "Fluctuations in external calcium concentration [Ca2+]e occur during the wake and sleep cycle and during intense neuronal activity. However, the incidence of these fluctuations on neuronal excitability is not precisely known. We show here that reducing divalent cation (Ca2+ and Mg2+) concentrations from 1.3/0.8 to 0.6/0.4 mM during 15-30 minutes induces long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. LTP-IE induced by low divalent cations is associated with a hyperpolarization of the action potential threshold and constitutes a positive feed-back of brain activity. This plasticity requires Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), IP3 receptor (IP3R) and calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). In fact, LTP-IE was occluded in the presence of the calcilytic NPS-2143 and absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. In addition, inhibiting IP3R with 2-APB and CaMKII with kin considerably reduced LTP-IE magnitude. LTP-IE and synaptic potentiation (LTP) induced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocol were also found to depend on CaSR as they were totally absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity was found to be reduced by ~35% following LTP induced by STDP. Importantly, this drop of spontaneous activity was not observed in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Taken together, these results show that CaSR plays a critical role in LTP-IE induced by low [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e and as well as in LTP of synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability induced by STDP.",

      "title": "Serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus scale O2 utilization in response to traumatic stress",
      "content": "Trauma is a main cause of psychiatric disorders. Approximately 24% of trauma-exposed individuals suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder throughout their lifetime, however, the vast majority of people are resilient. Why some people are resilient while others develop mental disorders in face of trauma in a short timescale? Here, we show that O2 actively initiates a cell-signaling pathway that regulates behavioral outcomes in response to traumatic stress. We found that serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT neurons) projecting to the ventral caudate putamen and the ventral tegmental area exhibit distinct physiological patterns of O2 utilization. In response to traumatic stress, O2 utilization in these neurons changed individually, following either a susceptible or resilient pattern, thereby modulating corresponding behaviors. This O2 scaling was regulated by ferroptosis within the DRN5-HT neurons. Thus, we identify a previously unrecognized function of O2, opening an avenue for the treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",
