      "title": "A Contextual Bandits Approach for Personalization of Hand Gesture Recognition",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.08915v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In human-computer interaction applications like hand gesture recognition, supervised learning models are often trained on a large population of users to achieve high task accuracy. However, due to individual variability in sensor signals and user behavior, static models may not provide optimal performance for all users. Personalizing pretrained models via calibration--collecting labeled data from each user--can improve performance but introduces user friction and struggles with limited data. To overcome these issues, we propose a calibrationless longitudinal personalization method: a contextual multi-arm bandit (MAB) algorithm combined with a pretrained neural network for gesture recognition. This reinforcement-learning-style approach enables personalization using binary reward signals, either user-provided or inferred by the system.\n  We validated this method in a user study. Participants wore a surface electromyography (sEMG) device and played multiple rounds of a 2-D navigation game using six hand gestures. In the session, they completed a baseline round and then a round with our algorithm; in the second session, they played another round with our algorithm. Our approach led to a significant reduction in users' average false negative rate by 0.113 from the initial to the final round, with further decreases between sessions. Average precision also trended upward (by 0.139) from the start to end of a round, continuing in the next session. Notably, some users who could not complete the game with the baseline model succeeded with our contextual MAB model. In summary, our",

      "title": "Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium MaxEnt",
      "content": "arXiv:2505.10444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a \"thermodynamic uncertainty relation.\" We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.",

      "title": "LITcoder: A General-Purpose Library for Building and Comparing Encoding Models",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.09152v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&amp;B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized), incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets, fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality high-performance predictive models of brain activity.\n  Project page: https://litcoder-brain.github.io",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.09213v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study introduces a novel, flexible, and implantable neural probe using a cost-effective microfabrication process based on a thin polyimide film. Polyimide film, known as Kapton, serves as a flexible substrate for microelectrodes, conductive tracks, and contact pads of the probe, which are made from a thin film of gold (Au). SU-8 is used to cover the corresponding tracks for electrical isolation and to increase the stiffness of the probe for better implantation. To evaluate the performance of the fabricated probe, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and artificial neural signal recording have been used to characterize its properties. The microelectrode dimensions have been carefully chosen to provide low impedance characteristics, which are necessary for acquiring local field potential (LFP) signals. The in vivo LFP data have been obtained from a male zebra finch presented with auditory stimuli. By properly filtering the extracellular recordings and analyzing the data, the obtained results have been validated by comparing them with the signals acquired with a commercial neural electrode. Due to the use of Kapton, SU-8, and Au materials with non-toxic and adaptable properties in the body environment, the fabricated neural probe is considered a promising biocompatible implantable neural probe that may pave the way for the fabrication of other neural implantable devices with commercial aims.",

      "title": "Path to Intelligence: Measuring Similarity between Human Brain and Large Language Model Beyond Language Task",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.08831v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like abilities in language-based tasks. While language is a defining feature of human intelligence, it emerges from more fundamental neurophysical processes rather than constituting the basis of intelligence itself. In this work, we study the similarity between LLM internal states and human brain activity in a sensory-motor task rooted in anticipatory and visuospatial behavior. These abilities are essential for cognitive performance that constitute human intelligence. We translate the sensory-motor task into natural language in order to replicate the process for LLMs. We extract hidden states from pre-trained LLMs at key time steps and compare them to human intracranial EEG signals. Our results reveal that LLM-derived reactions can be linearly mapped onto human neural activity. These findings suggest that LLMs, with a simple natural language translation to make them understand temporal-relevant tasks, can approximate human neurophysical behavior in experiments involving sensory stimulants. In all, our contribution is two-fold: (1) We demonstrate similarity between LLM and human brain activity beyond language-based tasks. (2) We demonstrate that with such similarity, LLMs could help us understand human brains by enabling us to study topics in neuroscience that are otherwise challenging to tackle.",

      "title": "Bidirectional modulation of sleep and wakefulness via prefrontal cortical chemogenetics",
      "content": "The drive to sleep is inescapable but its biological substrate remains largely elusive. Until recently, the search for sleep centres in the mammalian brain focussed on subcortical neurons that promote sleep or wakefulness, or induce state transitions. However, the regulatory elements of mammalian sleep circuitry, which govern the timing, amount and intensity of sleep, have proven difficult to elucidate. Growing evidence suggests an essential role for the cerebral cortex. Here we used a chemogenetic approach to test whether prefrontal cortex (PFC) layer 5 pyramidal neurons partake in the regulation of sleep. We found that inhibiting or exciting Rbp4-Cre neurons in the PFC with hM4Di/hM3Dq Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) increases and decreases sleep, respectively. Targeted PFC DREADD inhibition of Rbp4-Cre neurons induces sleep that electrophysiologically and architecturally resembles spontaneous sleep. In contrast, widespread cortical DREADD inhibition induces sleep that is punctuated by frequent brief awakenings, has suppressed rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and is followed by a rebound in electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity (SWA), typically observed after disrupted or lost sleep. Our work demonstrates that local modulation of cortical activity can bidirectionally change the amount of global sleep. This represents an important step in the dissection of sleep circuitry, aids the identification of molecular counterparts of sleep pressure, and accelerates the delineation of top-down sleep-regulatory pathways. Together, these lay the foundation for neurobiologically-informed sleep treatments, such as targeted non-invasive brain stimulation and cell-type specific pharmaceuticals, to better modulate sleep in humans.",

      "title": "Localized Space Coding and Phase Coding Complement Each Other to Achieve Robust and Efficient Spatial Representation",
      "content": "Localized space coding and phase coding are two distinct strategies responsible, respectively, for representing abstract structure and sensory observations in neural cognitive maps. In spatial representation, localized space coding is implemented by place cells in the hippocampus (HPC), while phase coding is implemented by grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Both strategies have their own advantages and disadvantages, and neither of them meets the requirement of representing space robustly and efficiently in the brain. Here, we show that through reciprocal connections between HPC and MEC, place and grid cells can complement each other to overcome their respective shortcomings. Specifically, we build a coupled network model, in which a continuous attractor neural network (CANN) with position coordinate models place cells, while multiple CANNs with phase coordinates model grid cell modules with varying spacings. The reciprocal connections between place and grid cells encode the correlation prior between the sensory cues processed by HPC and MEC, respectively. Using this model, we show that: 1) place and grid cells interact to integrate sensory cues in a Bayesian manner; 2) place cells complement grid cells in coding accuracy by eliminating non-local errors of the latter; 3) grid cells complement place cells in coding efficiency by enlarging the number of environmental maps stored stably by the latter. We demonstrate that the coupled network model explains the seemingly contradictory experimental findings about the remapping phenomena of place cells when grid cells are either inactivated or depolarized. This study gives us insight into understanding how the brain employs collaborative localized and phase coding to realize both robust and efficient information representation.",

      "title": "Cross-species brain circuitry from diffusion MRI tractography and mouse viral tracing",
      "content": "We integrate tracer-derived projection polarity from ~1,200 mouse injections with species-specific diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography to construct directed connectomes for mouse, marmoset, rhesus macaque, and human. We model brain circuitry as a directed connectome, in which asymmetric pathways capture the forward flow of neuronal signals. Using a common cross-species atlas as a scaffold, we introduced a multi-objective path efficiency metric that weighs projection strength against axonal length and applied directed shortest-path algorithms to quantify inter-regional influence. This framework revealed both conserved and divergent organization: the entorhinal-hippocampal projection remained the most efficient in all species, while humans exhibited strengthened temporal-insula-frontal circuits and reduced olfactory influence, rhesus macaques showed peak efficiencies in inferior temporal outflows, and marmosets maintained high olfactory influence. Together, these results establish a scalable approach for constructing directed connectomes across species and demonstrate how conserved and lineage-specific circuits jointly shaped association and sensory systems.",

      "title": "Not two sides of the same coin: Divergent effects of motor state on corticospinal and cortical responses to TMS of motor cortex",
      "content": "Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex can elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in target muscles, reflecting corticospinal excitability. MEP amplitudes increase with TMS intensity and can be facilitated by tonic muscle pre-activation. Since conventional transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs) also grow with increasing TMS intensity, cortical and corticospinal responses are often considered two facets of the same process. If this were true, changes in physiological motor state should modulate TEPs and MEPs in a similar manner. Methods: To compare the state-dependency of cortical and corticospinal responses to single-pulse TMS, we simultaneously recorded TEPs and MEPs in 16 healthy young adults during relaxation and isometric contraction of the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. For each condition, 100 biphasic TMS pulses were delivered to the left primary motor hand area at five different intensities centered around the resting motor threshold. Results: TEP and MEP amplitudes increased with stimulation intensity. As predicted, tonic muscle contraction consistently facilitated MEP. On the contrary, muscle contraction attenuated two key peaks of the TEP (N15 and N100). The state-dependent effects of corticospinal and cortical responses were not correlated. Discussion: Both TEPs and MEPs are reliably modulated by motor state, yet they differ in direction and their magnitudes do not scale with each other. These findings challenge the assumption that cortical and corticospinal responses are two aspects of the same process. MEP facilitation during contraction likely reflects increased spinal excitability, whereas TEP attenuation may reflect reduced responsiveness of cortico-cortical or cortico-subcortical networks.",

      "title": "Immunometabolic state modulation of sequential decision making in patch-foraging mice",
      "content": "Animals have evolved sophisticated behavioural and metabolic adaptations to respond to threats to homeostasis, including resource scarcity and infectious pathogens. Energy deficits associated with lack of food availability and sickness-associated anorexia elicit distinctive hypometabolic states, however how such states are integrated with higher-order cognition is largely unknown. Patch-foraging paradigms have proven useful for deciphering evolutionarily conserved and ethologically grounded insights into cost-benefit decision-making as animals continually deliberate between exploiting and exploring their environment. We developed and extensively validated a touchscreen-based patch-foraging task for mice in which food reward dynamically varied across trials, in a dataset comprising over 111,000 sequential decisions from 35 adult male mice. Contrary to predictions that emphasize the impact of inflammation to blunt effortful reward-driven behaviour, our results demonstrate that systemic lipopolysaccharides-induced inflammation promotes hyper-exploitation by attenuating exploratory choice behaviour in animals interacting with complex food environments. Such behaviour can be seen as a bias towards immediate outcomes, with impulsivity as a feature affecting the weighting of temporal factors. Given the ubiquity of systemic inflammation in numerous infectious, metabolic and psychiatric disorders featuring dysfunctional value- and cost-sensitive behaviour, these results provide insight into how immunometabolic states are linked to altered decision-making.",

      "title": "Effective connectivity of the human claustrum: Triple networks, subcortical circuits and psychedelic modulation",
      "content": "Decades of cross-species research highlight the claustrums extensive bidirectional connectivity with cortical and subcortical regions, implicating it in higher-order cognitive processes requiring synchronized brain states. Psychedelics may disrupt this synchrony by modulating claustro-cortical signaling, reflected by the dissolution of cortical network signatures. Using spectral dynamic causal modeling on resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and PsiConnect datasets at 7T and 3T, we provide the first in vivo characterization of claustral effective connectivity with triple networks and subcortical regions in humans, both at rest and under the influence of psilocybin. Claustra displayed widespread bidirectional effective connectivity and a strong inhibitory influence on all target regions. Psilocybin enhanced claustral inhibition of cortical networks while disinhibiting subcortical areas, partially associated with psychedelic subjective effect scores. These findings are consistent with cellular and functional cross-species data, supporting the proposed mechanism of claustro-cortical inhibition in regulating network synchrony, while extending this influence to the subcortex, and revealing hierarchical and hemispheric asymmetries in claustral signaling modulation under psilocybin.",
