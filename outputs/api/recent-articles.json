      "content": "In image recognition tasks, subjects with long distances and low resolution remain a challenge, whereas gait recognition, identifying subjects by walking patterns, is considered one of the most promising biometric technologies due to its stability and efficiency. Previous gait recognition methods mostly focused on constructing a sophisticated model structure for better model performance during evaluation. Moreover, these methods are primarily based on traditional convolutional neural networks...",

It facilitates the recognition of sign gestures and converts them into spoken languages. One of the main challenges for developing SLR systems is the lack of annotated datasets. This issue is more noticeable with low-resourced sign languages. To address this issue, we propose a pretrained large vision model, SignVLM, for SLR.

This invites the question: are we equally aware of activity in both pathways? And if not,...",

      "content": "Electronic skins (e-skins) incorporating island architectures represent a promising platform for strain-insensitive tactile sensing by mechanically decoupling sensing units from deformations. However, conventional island designs encounter stress concentration issues caused by inherent modulus mismatches, critically limiting achievable island densities. This limitation forces a stubborn trade-off between strain-insensitivity and sensing resolution. Here, inspired by the entangled elastin networks...",

      "content": "High-density tactile sensor arrays that replicate human touch could restore texture perception in paralyzed individuals. However, conventional tactile sensor arrays face inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, sensitivity, and crosstalk suppression due to microstructure size limitations and signal interference. To address this, we developed a tactile sensor featuring 10 \u03bcm-scale pyramid tips that achieve ultra-high sensitivity (8.082 kPa^(-1) in 0.2-0.5 kPa range). By integrating a...",

For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",
