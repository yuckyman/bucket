      "title": "Intrinsic and extrinsic feedback generate similar propulsion but distinct biomechanical strategies during split-belt walking",
      "content": "BackgroundForward propulsion during walking is generated by different joints and biomechanical mechanisms depending on environmental and task demands. Although propulsion can be modulated by feedback, it is unclear whether extrinsic and intrinsic feedback generate similar propulsion or promote different joint-level strategies during split-belt walking. The purpose of this study was to investigate strategies used by non-impaired individuals to generate greater propulsion using different feedback to reach targeted levels of propulsion force during split-belt walking.MethodsFifteen young adults walked on a split-belt treadmill with the dominant leg on the fast belt at their comfortable walking speed and the non-dominant leg on the slow belt at half speed. They performed trials with extrinsic via visual feedback of propulsive force (targeting 5 and 10% body weight) and with intrinsic feedback via a backward resistive force at the center of mass (5 and 10% body weight). Primary outcome was propulsion accuracy, measured as average propulsion error relative to target levels. Secondary analyses examined explanatory biomechanical variables related to propulsion generation. Outcomes were analyzed using two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.ResultsParticipants achieved similar target propulsion across feedback types (p =\u202f0.66). However, biomechanical strategies differed. Visual feedback increased trailing limb angle (TLA) at 5% (p =\u202f0.0011) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001) and increased ankle moment at 5% (p =\u202f0.0005) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001). In contrast, backward resistive force increased (BRF) hip moment at 5% (p =\u202f0.0018) and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001), and hip power at both 5 and 10% (p <\u202f0.0001). Ankle power did not differ between feedback types at 5% (p =\u202f0.0754) but was greater under BRF at 10% (p <\u202f0.0001).ConclusionWhile both feedback types generate similar propulsion to achieve different target levels during split-belt treadmill walking, they engaged distinct biomechanical strategies. Our results indicate that participants increased TLA and ankle moment under visual feedback. However, they increased hip moment and hip power under BRF, with ankle power adjustments depending on the target level. The findings highlight motor abundance in gait and suggest tailoring rehabilitation strategies in populations with impaired propulsion.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Eye-tracking during free visual exploration of familiar dramatic character faces facilitates rapid and accurate stroke recognition",
      "content": "BackgroundStroke patients often experience significant impairments, making rapid and accurate detection crucial for timely intervention and early warning. However, existing diagnostic methods such as advanced neuroimaging are often time-consuming, highly dependent on operator expertise, or costly and complex to deploy, limiting their scalability in resource-restricted settings. Eye movement patterns in stroke patients present a promising opportunity for efficient detection, given their close ties to underlying neurocognitive mechanisms and potential diagnostic sensitivity. Nevertheless, the lack of a feasible task paradigm and robust detection strategy has hindered the practical application of eye movement-based stroke identification. This study aimed to capture eye movement dysfunction associated with stroke through an ecological paradigm and develop a machine learning model with improved diagnostic accuracy.MethodsWe recorded eye movement signals in stroke patients (N = 16) and healthy controls (N = 23) during free visual exploration of familiar dramatic character faces. A diverse set of eye movement features, encompassing saccadic, fixation, and scanpath features, was extracted and analyzed. These features were subsequently employed to construct machine learning models for the recognition of stroke patients.ResultsWe identified distinctive eye movement patterns in the stroke group, including prolonged fixation duration, restricted saccadic movements, and reduced scanpath length, which reflect underlying visual processing impairments. Furthermore, by integrating these multi-dimensional eye movement features, our machine learning model achieved a high accuracy of 87.18% and an excellent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.92 in distinguishing stroke patients.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that ecologically valid eye-tracking, combined with multi-type feature analytics, serves as a practical screening tool with the potential to significantly improve identification accuracy and alleviate logistical burdens in community and primary care settings.",

      "content": "The spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR) can reproduce synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Analysis of the synaptic weights in the network with the STLR is challenging. Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.
