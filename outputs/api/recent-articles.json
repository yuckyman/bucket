      "title": "Computational modeling and preclinical validation support targeting somatic instability for Huntington's disease treatment",
      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Genetic modifiers of disease onset and progression in HD implicate somatic instability (SI) of the expanded CAG repeat as a key pathogenic driver, with MSH3 emerging as a leading therapeutic target. Reducing SI, particularly in the most affected neuronal cell type, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum, is thus a rational therapeutic strategy for HD. To inform the development of an SI-targeted therapy, we generated a computational model simulating SI in MSNs to infer therapeutic effects on MSN survival resulting from an intervention that reduces SI. The model takes advantage of HD patient data to predict therapeutic benefit across a range of inherited CAG lengths and ages of intervention, considering the degree of target engagement regionally and per cell. To target SI experimentally, we designed an artificial microRNA to lower MSH3 mRNA (miMSH3) after delivery with AAV-DB-3, a previously described MSN-targeting AAV capsid variant. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 achieved from 48 to 94% MSH3 mRNA reduction in MSNs of nonhuman primates (NHPs), which, when modeled, would reduce the composite Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale change over baseline from 50 to over 120% as well as delay motor symptom onset by many years. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 also showed robust target engagement in vivo with up to 46% reduction in SI in HdhQ111 mice. The integration of preclinical experimental data and the computational model support the translational potential of AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 as a disease modifying therapy applicable for HD patients with a broad range of inherited repeat lengths.",

      "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder Affects Brain Metals",
      "content": "Background: One of the risks associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD) is dementia. While the exact pathology is unknown, there is increasing evidence that alcohol consumption may dysregulate iron homeostasis in the brain leading to increased brain iron concentrations. Unregulated iron can produce oxidative stress and cellular damage to neurons. Iron-related cellular death is a relatively new finding and is called ferroptosis. To test the hypothesis that alcohol use disorder may cause brain iron dysregulation, we measured iron in hippocampus, caudate and substantia nigra in brain tissues obtained from individuals diagnosed with (AUD) and from individuals with no apparent alcoholrelated problems. Methods: We obtained hippocampus, caudate, and substantia nigra tissues from the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource Centre, University of Sydney. The tissues came from 20 males and 20 females, half of each diagnosed with AUD. The tissues were wet-ashed and prepared for analysis of iron, copper, and zinc by total x-ray reflectance fluorescence. Results: In the hippocampus, we observed AUD-related decreased iron, but nothing more. In the substantia nigra, we observed a significant increase in iron and a trend toward an in increase in copper content in females and decreased iron and zinc in males. In the caudate we saw a near doubling of iron in females and a significant increase in copper in females and males. Conclusions: These results provide direct evidence that at least part of AUD-related pathophysiology involves the dysregulation of trace metals in the brain. These changes are more severe in females, which may relate to extended levels of exposure due to slower alcohol metabolism.",

      "title": "High performance sorting of motor unit action potentials with EMUsort",
      "content": "Understanding how neural signals control muscle activity during behavior is a key challenge in motor neuroscience. To this end, recent advances in intramuscular multielectrode arrays have enabled high-quality multichannel recordings of many motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in freely moving subjects. However, identifying individual MUAP events within multichannel recordings is a significant challenge for existing spike sorting methods, which are typically optimized for identifying action potentials from neurons in the brain. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Enhanced Motor Unit sorter (EMUsort), an extension of Kilosort4 (KS4) that achieves high-performance MUAP spike sorting. We applied EMUsort to high-resolution intramuscular recordings from rat forelimb during locomotion and monkey forelimb during a reaching task. EMUsort improves upon prior methods by addressing key challenges encountered with MUAP datasets, including: 1) long time delays across electrodes due to propagation along muscle fibers, 2) more complex waveform shapes compared to neuronal action potentials, and 3) a high degree of MUAP overlap due to cumulative motor unit recruitment. We compared EMUsort to existing spike sorting methods quantitatively using simulated datasets that closely emulated the rat and monkey datasets we recorded. EMUsort provided median error rate reductions of 67.5% and 49.9% during periods of high motor unit activation for the rat and monkey datasets, respectively. In sum, EMUsort provides a substantial improvement to MUAP spike sorter accuracy, especially during regions of high MUAP overlap, in an easy-to-use software package.",

Feel free to ask questions!<p>---<p>Abstract:<p>We present a novel authentication system that transforms a Rubik's cube into a physical key for digital authentication. By reading the cube's specific arrangement among 43 quintillion possible configurations, our system generates FIDO2-compatible credentials on-demand. Unlike traditional security tokens that store credentials, the cube itself becomes part of the key with its physical state forming a deterministic seed for keypair generation. Our proof-of-concept, CubeAuthn, demonstrates this concept with a browser extension that authenticates users on WebAuthn-enabled sites using the cube's physical state as the cryptographic seed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46533315\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46533315</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "Show HN: An LLM response cache that's aware of dynamic data",
      "content": "<p>Raymond here from Butter.dev, an LLM response cache built as a chat-completions proxy. Today we're launching a key feature for the platform: the ability to generalize on dynamic, templated inputs.<p>Caching at the HTTP request level has the obvious problem of generalizability. Nearly no request is identical, due to templated variables (like names) and metadata (like timestamps), so exact-match cache lookups rarely hit. We solve this at Butter by using LLMs to detect dynamic content in requests and derive their inter-relationships, allowing the cache entry to be stored as a template + variables + deterministic code. This allows future requests to contain different variable data, yet still serve from cache.<p>We've found this approach greatly improves cache hit rate, and believe it could be useful for agents performing repetitive back-office tasks, computer use, or data transformations where input data is frequently of the same shape.<p>- You can see a demo of learning patterns here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA</a><p>- We wrote more about the technical approach here: <a href=\"https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-response-caching\">https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-...</a><p>- It's free to try out here: <a href=\"https://butter.dev/auth\">https://butter.dev/auth</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
