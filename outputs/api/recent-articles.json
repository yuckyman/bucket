      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Although levodopa and DBS did not significantly improve reading speed or contrast acuity after single dosing or turning DBS on and off, in this small study, these findings provide valuable insights into the stability of these visual symptoms under current treatments. There was evidence that DBS surgery may improve certain aspects of reading speed and contrast acuity and further study is needed. This work underscores the need for innovative approaches to enhance visual function in...",

Despite this, WASH policies and adaptation strategies often overlook the need for disability inclusive measures. The scoping review objectives are to 1) map the evidence on how climate risks affect WASH services and coping strategies in low-and middle-income countries, with a particular focus on people with...",

The detection of AML through medical imaging is challenging due to the complex structural and textural variations inherent in bone marrow images. These challenges are further intensified by the overlapping intensity between leukemia and non-leukemia regions, which reduces the effectiveness of traditional predictive models. This study...",

Many people with COPD remain smokers after diagnosis, and it is unclear whether low BMI is because of the disease itself or its most common risk factor. We aim to assess the independent and combined effects of smoking and COPD on BMI trajectories. 27,651 patients without COPD and 25,990 with COPD from The...",
