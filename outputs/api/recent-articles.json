      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "Altered Frontoparietal, Temporal and Sensorimotor Structure-Function Coupling and Its Genetic Underpinnings in Bipolar Disorder",
      "content": "Background: Structure-function coupling quantifies how strongly structural connectivity supports functional communication across brain regions. Investigating structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder, a condition marked by dysconnectivity, may elucidate underlying neural mechanisms. We examined regional structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder and its genetic underpinnings to characterize network-level disruptions. Methods: Regional structure-function coupling was estimated in UK Biobank participants using edge-wise regression between measures of structural connectivity and functional connectivity. Bipolar disorder (n=163) and controls (n=326) were age and sex-matched and compared using general linear models. To explore the genetic basis of these structure-function coupling alterations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in an independent UK Biobank sample (n=38,190) for regions showing significant group differences. Results: Structure-function coupling demonstrated a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient with highest coupling evident in visual regions (R^2=0.29) and lowest in the insula (R^2=0.03). The Bipolar disorder group showed higher structure-function coupling in the temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus (beta=0.269; beta=0.211) and lower coupling in the supramarginal, precentral, and postcentral gyri and the frontal pole (beta=-0.206 to -0.275). GWAS identified seven significant loci, with mapped genes (e.g., KAT6B, INPP5A, PLCE1) involved in neuronal development and cellular signaling. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder showed altered structure-function coupling across regions implicating multiple networks. These alterations suggest stronger structure-function alignment in limbic and attention networks and weaker alignment in sensorimotor, executive, frontoparietal, and salience regions relative to controls, potentially disrupting flexible polysynaptic communication. Altered coupling may relate to genetic variation affecting neurodevelopment, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings offer novel insight into the architectural contributions to the pathophysiology underlying bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow enables axon and dendrite development and maintenance",
      "content": "Distinct microtubule arrays form in axons and dendrites defining their functions in neurons. These arrays are thought to develop through separate processes. Here we challenge this view by showing that axons and dendrites develop by a unifying process: slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow (MT-RF), a recently discovered mechanism of microtubule dynamics. By integrating quantitative data of microtubule dynamics and distributions into a newly developed biophysical model of microtubules across developmental stages, we uncover that MT-RF interacts with microtubule stability and nucleation. Without MT-RF slowdown, this interaction suppresses development and maintenance of axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays. In axons, MT-RF slowdown enables microtubules to reach the tip, even at long distances, supporting axon growth. In dendrites, late MT-RF slowdown facilitates an efficient increase in stable microtubules. Thus, our data-integrated model reveals MT-RF slowdown as central for the development of distinct neuronal compartments, providing a unifying mechanism for microtubule-related physiology.",

      "title": "Glucodynamic Network Transitions of the Human Brain",
      "content": "Variability in neuronal firing patterns enables the brain to flexibly transition between network states, a hallmark of adaptive information processing. Yet the energetic basis of this flexibility remains unknown. Here, we report that the capacity of the brain to shift between network states is contingent on the moment-to-moment variability of glucose metabolism. Using simultaneous resting-state functional FDG-PET and BOLD fMRI in 78 healthy adults (20 to 86 years), we quantified brain metabolic and haemodynamic variability, complexity, and dynamic network connectivity. Individuals with greater variability and complexity of glucose metabolism demonstrated a broader repertoire of network states, marked by globally connected and influential central hubs. Individuals who achieved a broader range of network states had better cognitive performance. In older adults, widespread reductions in dynamic metabolic connectivity were observed. Glucodynamic parameters predicted age and cognitive performance more robustly than haemodynamic measures. These findings reveal that functional network dynamics are emergent properties of the brain's metabolic architecture and that the organisation of large-scale neural circuits is constrained by energetic principles. This understanding may provide critical new insights into the metabolic basis of brain ageing, neurodegeneration and psychiatric conditions.",

      "title": "A Multimodal Framework for Understanding Perceptual Segmentation of Natural Scenes In Autism",
      "content": "Understanding how individuals segment complex natural scenes into perceptual segments is essential for explaining both typical and atypical sensory processing. In Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), differences in visual segmentation and integration are widely documented. However, existing paradigms often rely on simplified stimuli and do not capture the dynamic, naturalistic processes underlying real world scene segmentation. To overcome those limitations, in this work we present a novel, multimodal experimental framework. The framework combines precisely timed, trial-based perceptual measurements with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how neural activity aligns temporally with segmentation decisions and with eye-tracking to examine visual exploration strategies and attention allocation. Neurotypical (NT) participants and participants with ASD aged 16 years and above viewed natural scenes and textures and indicated whether two cued image regions belonged to the same or different perceptual segments. Responses to multiple pairs of cues enabled the estimation of subjectively perceived segmentation maps and the associated uncertainty. Across NT and ASD populations, we analyzed segmentation maps, reaction time distributions, gaze profiles, and trial-aligned neural responses. Behavioral results revealed slower and more idiosyncratic segmentation patterns in ASD. Eye-tracking analyses also demonstrated distinct gaze patterns suggesting broader exploration of the images during early viewing. EEG analyses demonstrated delayed & more diffuse occipital activation in ASD, accompanied by reduced global field power at several key time windows spanning stimulus presentation. Together, these findings establish a reproducible method for studying the temporal and spatial components of natural scene segmentation and indicate meaningful behavioral and neural distinctions in ASD. This framework provides a methodological bridge between controlled experimental stimuli and real-world perception in both neurotypical and neurodivergent populations.",

      "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "title": "Distinct talkers combat catastrophic failures of spatial attention due to interruption",
      "content": "Task-irrelevant features can impact formation of auditory objects and influence the effectiveness of selective attention, including the buildup of attention over time. Using a previously established paradigm exploring the effects of random interruptions on spatial selective attention, this study explores how the task-irrelevant feature of talker identity impacts the buildup of spatial attention and whether it alters the impact of interruptions. Participants performed a sequence recall task in which participants were presented with two competing syllable sequences coming from different spatial directions and were asked to report the syllable sequence coming from the target direction. On half of the trials, an unpredictable, novel interrupting sound occurred, disrupting attentional focus. Two experiments explored how talker influenced performance, specifically, whether 1) making the two streams come from different talkers facilitates task performance and reduces the impact of interruption compared to when the streams are spoken by the same talker, and 2) talker discontinuity interferes with attention buildup and harms syllable recall performance compared to when the talker is the same from one syllable to the next. Our results showed that distinct talker features, though task-irrelevant in this spatial task, significantly improved syllable recall performance and reduced the impact of interrupters. Further, irrelevant talker discontinuities damaged attention buildup and reduced syllable recall performance.",

      "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
      "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",
