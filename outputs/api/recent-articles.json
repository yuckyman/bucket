      "title": "Distinct prior expectations shape tactile and proprioceptive localization",
      "content": "When a mosquito lands on your finger, swatting it away requires your brain to calculate its location in the external space, which depends on the body's 3D posture. Two competing hypotheses explain how the brain solves this challenge: the integration hypothesis, where tactile signals are transformed into spatial coordinates by integrating touch and posture information; and the cueing hypothesis, where touch merely cues a location on the body whose position is specified via proprioception. Adjudicating between these hypotheses is nearly impossible without modeling the latent factors underlying somatosensory spatial perception. We fill this gap in the present study. We first formalized each hypothesis from a Bayesian perspective: If touch merely triggers proprioceptive localization (cueing hypothesis), tactile and proprioceptive localization should rely on the same Bayesian computations, with identical prior expectations about the mosquito's spatial location; If they involve distinct Bayesian computational processes (integration hypothesis), distinct prior expectations may shape tactile and proprioceptive localization. To test these predictions, we had nineteen participants localize either proprioceptive or tactile targets on their fingertips. We then fit their data with several Bayesian models of each hypothesis. Models allowing different prior distributions between modalities provided the best fit for most participants, with 17 out of 19 participants showing significantly different prior distributions across modalities. These provide strong computational evidence that tactile and proprioceptive localization rely on distinct computational mechanisms, a conclusion that has important implications for how we understand these everyday behaviors and their neural mechanisms.",

      "title": "Critical neuronal avalanches emerge from excitation-inhibition balanced spontaneous activity",
      "content": "Neuronal avalanches are sequences of neural activations that exhibit scale-invariant statistics, suggesting neural activity operates near a critical point. Theoretical studies proposed that the balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I), along with neuromodulation, are key factors influencing this critical behavior. Here, we performed in-vivo studies to investigate the role of E and I neurons in generating neuronal avalanches in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae. For this, we used double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing cell-type-specific fluorescent proteins and GCaMP6f, combined with immunostaining and selective-plane illumination microscopy to monitor spontaneous neuronal activity and neurotransmitter identity. We found that neural activity approached criticality at balanced E-I ratios but became disordered when E-I ratios were imbalanced. A stochastic network model operating at a critical point, where excitation and inhibition couplings are balanced and balanced amplification drives network avalanches, successfully reproduced the observed statistics of neuronal avalanches and their dependence on E-I ratio fluctuations.",

      "title": "Mislocalisation of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes causes axonopathy and dysmyelination",
      "content": "Neurons with large, myelinated axons are vulnerable to degeneration across the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) disease spectrum. The defining molecular pathology of this spectrum is mislocalisation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Even though cytoplasmic TDP-43 is prevalent in neurons and oligodendrocytes, how these molecular pathologies contribute to neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here we developed humanised zebrafish in which we restricted TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 restricted to neurons led to a severe axonopathy, with extreme distal axonal swelling and reduced myelination. Axonopathy was mirrored by cell type specific loss of TDP-43 function from neurons, pointing to loss of function, rather than a toxic gain of function of mislocalised TDP-43, as driving this phenotype. Preventing oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination when TDP-43 was mislocalised in neurons exacerbated axonopathy, indicating that oligodendrocytes limit neurodegeneration. Indeed, when TDP-43 was mislocalised to the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes this also led to axonopathy and reduced myelination, pointing to complex contributions of neurons and oligodendrocytes to neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Vectorial boundary representation of 3D layout in human visual cortex",
      "content": "Human spatial navigation relies on the brains ability to visually represent the 3D layout of the environment. To understand how the brain encodes the layout information, it is crucial to identify the key features of environmental layout and how they are processed in the human brain. The vector coding principle, which highlight the role of boundary distance and orientation, provides a theoretical framework supported by physiological evidence from rodents. In this study, we developed a reconstruction approach to quantitatively estimate 3D layout information from natural indoor scene images. This approach enabled analyses of fMRI data from the large-scale Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) using vector-based models of 3D layout. To validate the NSD-based results and examine task-related dynamics, we further conducted fMRI and MEG experiments with navigation-related and non-navigational tasks. Controlling for low-, mid-, and high-level visual and semantic features of natural indoor scenes, we found a spatiotemporal dissociation between boundary distance and orientation representations in the human brain. Relative distance was encoded in the early visual cortex during early processing in a task-invariant manner, whereas orientation was represented in scene-selective higher visual areas during later processing and was modulated by navigation-related tasks. Importantly, task modulation manifested as feedback-induced enhancement of orientation coding in the early visual cortex. Together, these findings provide a novel perspective on how the human brain represents navigation-relevant information about the immediate surrounding environment, advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms that link perception to action in spatial navigation.",

      "content": "Action selection in cluttered environments, where individuals must simultaneously pursue goals and avoid obstacles, presents a significant challenge for the brain. To understand the underlying mechanisms of action selection in such contexts, we propose a computational model that extends stochastic optimal control theory through a novel framework for obstacle avoidance. The model decomposes action selection as a weighted combination of individual control policies, each generated for either target approach or obstacle avoidance. By integrating value information from goals, obstacles, and actions into a unified measure of \"relative desirability\", the model dynamically determines the contribution of each policy to the overall action selection process. We evaluated the framework using simulated target-reaching tasks in cluttered environments based on previous human studies. The results showed that the model captures key features of human motor behavior, including the influence of obstacle properties on movement trajectories and the transient tendency to initiate movements toward obstacles before avoidance. This work offers new insights into the dynamic interaction between approach and avoidance behaviors, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding action selection in complex and naturalistic settings.",

      "title": "Active vision modulates early cortical stages of visual processing: Evidence from MEG and eye-tracking",
      "content": "It has been hypothesized that the visual system anticipates upcoming visual input contingent on the execution of saccadic eye movements. In line with this idea, it has been shown that changes in visual input across saccades elicit stronger post-saccadic fixation-locked neural responses compared to no-change conditions; an effect known as the preview effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that this preview effect depends on active vision and cannot be explained by either classical or spatiotopic adaptation. In a gaze-contingent experiment, in which participants were cued to make saccades to object stimuli, we concurrently recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking data. The source-localized MEG signal was deconvolved with stimulus onset and eye movement events in order to account for systematic variation in gaze behavior related to the no-change (valid preview) and change (invalid preview) conditions. Crucially, preview effects in the primary visual and in ventral-occipital cortices were markedly larger when participants made saccades compared to replay blocks in which we simulated the visual consequences of saccades absent saccade execution, demonstrating that the preview effect cannot be simply explained by classic adaptation. A further control condition ruled out spatiotopic adaptation. Our results show that early visual cortical areas which are not known to exhibit saccadic remapping neurons still show signs of sequential neural history effects across saccades. Previous research might have overlooked this influence of active vision because of the lack of an invalid preview condition which breaks the correspondence between pre-saccadic extrafoveal and post-saccadic foveal stimulation.",

      "content": "Wormtrails is a python package designed to create images and videos depicting the motion of C. elegans nematodes on solid media. Darkfield or brightfield images may be converted into stills or movies, with time encoded by color. This package was primarily designed to be used for visualizing locomotion during chemotaxis, but it may be used to visualize locomotory patterns in a wide array of behavioral assays.",
