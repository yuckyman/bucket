      "title": "Policy-Gradient Reinforcement Learning as a General Theory of Practice-Based Motor Skill Learning",
      "content": "Mastering any new skill requires extensive practice, but the computational principles underlying this learning are not clearly understood. Existing theories of motor learning can explain short-term adaptation to perturbations, but offer little insight into the processes that drive gradual skill improvement through practice. Here, we propose that practice-based motor skill learning can be understood as a form of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically, policy-gradient RL, a simple, model-free method that is widely used in robotics and other continuous control settings. Here, we show that models based on policy-gradient learning rules capture key properties of human skill learning across a diverse range of learning tasks that have previously lacked any computational theory. We suggest that policy-gradient RL can provide a general theoretical framework and foundation for understanding how humans hone skills through practice.",

Notably, PSH frequently coexists with other primary headache disorders, particularly migraine, suggesting a possible shared biology.",

      "content": "Stroke remains one of the leading causes of disability and death among adults globally. Both Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Non-invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) have shown significant potential in facilitating motor recovery in stroke patients. The combination of BCI and NIBS enhances brain functional reorganization and accelerates motor recovery post-stroke through a real-time feedback mechanism. By modulating neural plasticity, this combined approach can alter the trajectory of motor...",

In the present study, we explored the modulation of cTBS on resting state electroencephalogram (rsEEG) during wakefulness and subsequent sleep in patients with insomnia disorder. Forty-one patients with insomnia received three sessions active and sham cTBS in a counterbalanced crossover design. Each session comprised 600 pulses over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

The registry demonstrated reliable data capture and highlighted important trends in patient demographics and surgical practices. Continued data collection will enhance clinical decision-making and support policy development, ultimately improving care for auditory implant recipients.",

Traditional diagnostic solutions, including medical history collection and psychological assessments, often struggle to differentiate their similar clinical presentations, leading to time-consuming, laborious, and a high rate of misdiagnosis. Here, we propose Emoface, an AI-assisted...",

However, high inter-subject variability in EEG signals requires user-specific calibration, which can be time-consuming and limit the application of deep learning approaches, due to general need of large amount of data to properly train these models. In this context, this paper proposes a multidimensional and explainable deep learning framework for fast and...",
