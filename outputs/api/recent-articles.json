      "content": "IntroductionTo address the challenges of cumulative errors, insufficient modeling of complex spatiotemporal features, and limitations in computational efficiency and generalization ability in 4D trajectory prediction, this paper proposes a high-precision, robust prediction method.MethodsA hybrid model SVMD-DBO-RCBAM is constructed, integrating sequential variational modal decomposition (SVMD), the dung beetle optimization algorithm (DBO), and the ResNet-CBAM network. Innovations include frequency-domain feature decoupling, dynamic parameter optimization, and enhanced spatio-temporal feature focusing.ResultsExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.DiscussionExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.",

      "content": "The structural integrity of poultry eggs is essential for food safety, economic value, and hatchability. External eggshell quality-measured by thickness, strength, cracks, color, and cleanliness-is a key criterion for grading and sorting. Traditional assessment methods, although simple, suffer from subjectivity, low efficiency, and destructive nature. In contrast, recent developments in nondestructive testing (NDT) technologies have enabled precise, automated, and real-time evaluation of...",

Although several machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, accident detection systems are not widely deployed, and most existing solutions fail to handle the growing complexity of modern traffic environments.

      "content": "Achieving rapid and accurate object classification holds significant importance in various domains. However, conventional vision-based techniques suffer from several limitations, including high data redundancy and strong dependence on image quality. In this work, we present a high-speed, image-free object classification method based on dual-pixel measurement and normalized central moment invariants. Leveraging the complementary modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD), the...",

Accurate cancer burden information is crucial for policy planning, but many countries do not have up-to-date cancer surveillance data. To inform global cancer-control efforts, we used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2023 framework to generate and analyse estimates of cancer burden for 47 cancer types or groupings by age, sex, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023, cancer burden...",
