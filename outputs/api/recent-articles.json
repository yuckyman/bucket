      "title": "Pre-stimulus pupil-linked arousal enhances initial stimulus availability and accelerates decay in iconic memory.",
      "content": "Pupil diameter reflects not only reflexive responses to light but also spontaneous fluctuations in arousal. Such pre-stimulus fluctuations may shape visual performance, yet it remains unclear whether they only affect perceptual sensitivity or decision processes in near-threshold tasks, or instead influence the temporal availability of sensory information even for highly visible stimuli. We tested whether pupil-linked arousal modulates iconic memory, a high-capacity but short-lived visual store bridging sensory encoding and short-term memory. Based on a model in which a brief stimulus evokes an internal response decaying over a few hundred milliseconds, we hypothesized that increased arousal enhances performance either by amplifying the initial response or by slowing its decay. Thirty-seven participants viewed brief displays of six oriented stimuli, followed by a cue after a variable stimulus-cue onset asynchrony indicating which item to report. Pre-stimulus pupil diameter was continuously recorded, and behavioral data were fitted with an exponential decay function estimating initial stimulus availability, decay rate, and asymptotic performance. Larger pre-stimulus pupil dilation was associated with higher initial stimulus availability but faster decay of the iconic trace, while information transferred into short-term memory and confidence ratings remained unaffected. These findings demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations in arousal shape the temporal dynamics of sensory persistence. Elevated arousal boosts the initial strength of visual representations but shortens their duration, suggesting that arousal adaptively prioritizes rapid updating of visual input over prolonged stability.",

      "title": "From Perception to Appraisal: Hierarchical Brain Responses to Natural and Built Features in Urban Environments",
      "content": "Exposure to urban rather than natural environments has been linked to elevated stress and diminished well-being, prompting interest in the underlying mechanisms and influences of specific urban elements. This study investigated how semantic and lower-level visual characteristics of urban scenes influence subjective experience and underlying neural processes. A total of 63 adults viewed street-level photographs depicting Berlin environments with varying proportions of vegetation, buildings, vehicles, and sky visibility while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Subjective ratings indicated that urban scenes with more greenery compared to built elements were consistently perceived as more positive. In terms of lower-level image features, images with higher non-straight edge density also led to scenes being perceived as more positive. In contrast, more visible sky area and a higher mean metric depth led to more negative scene appraisal. On a neural level, urban scenes with higher greenery/built ratios enhanced visual evoked P1 amplitudes, while higher straight-edge density led to more pronounced N1 amplitudes. Further analysis showed that later P3 and LPP components predicted subjective ratings on higher-level evaluative but not basic affective dimensions. These results partially replicate previous studies, suggesting that urban greenery exerts an effect on subjective well-being and influences early visual processing. Moving forward, neurourbanism research should employ more diversified stimuli and leverage immersive or in situ paradigms to refine our understanding of the relationship between greenery in urban environments and well-being to inform evidence-based urban design strategies.",

      "title": "lncRNA 3222401L13Rik/ENSG00000272070 modulates microglial inflammatory programs in association with PU.1",
      "content": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of brain function, but their contribution to microglial aging and neurodegenerative disease remains largely unknown. Because only 1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins, whereas the vast majority of transcripts belong to the largely unexplored non-coding RNAome, elucidating the functions of non-coding RNAs provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the space for therapeutic discovery. We recently identified the glia-enriched lncRNA 3222401L13Rik as upregulated in the aging mouse hippocampus. Here, we investigated its function in microglia and its human homolog ENSG00000272070. We found that 3222401L13Rik is expressed in both astrocytes and microglia and increases with age. Knockdown of 3222401L13Rik in primary microglia led to enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFalpha, and increased phagocytic activity. RNA sequencing revealed widespread transcriptional changes enriched for TNF and complement signaling pathways. The human homolog ENSG00000272070 showed conserved functions in iPSC-derived microglia, where its loss similarly promoted inflammatory gene expression and phagocytosis. Mechanistically, 3222401L13Rik interacts with the microglial transcription factor PU.1, and its depletion overlapped with PU.1-driven transcriptional programs. Consistent with these findings, ENSG00000272070 expression was significantly reduced in postmortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and AD-associated genes were enriched among 3222401L13Rik-regulated targets. Together, our results identify 3222401L13Rik/ENSG00000272070 as a conserved, aging-associated lncRNA that modulates microglial inflammatory states through interaction with PU.1. This work links glial lncRNA regulation to AD-related neuroinflammation and suggests 3222401L13Rik as a potential molecular target to fine-tune microglial activity in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Competition Between Memory Updating and Differentiation Emerges from Intrinsic Network Dynamics",
      "content": "When an event occurs that is similar to a previous experience, the original episodic memory can be modified with new information (updating) or a new memory can be encoded (differentiation). Prediction errors, the deviation between expected and actual stimuli, are believed to mediate the competition between updating and differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present a new analysis of experimental studies (Boeltzig, Liedtke, & Schubotz, 2025; Liedtke et al., 2025) that examine recognition memory and cued recall of similar conversations. The original version was recognized more confidently than the modified version, and the recognition confidence for modified versions showed a U-shaped dependence on the prediction error. Furthermore, the larger the prediction error, the more frequently participants retrieved two versions during cued recall. To account for these results, we propose a computational model based on a modified Hopfield network, which encodes the original and modified versions sequentially and weights the encoding of new patterns by the prediction error. The model shows that (1) similar new memories interfere with previous ones (updating) while dissimilar ones are stored separately (differentiation), (2) interference from similar representations leads to reduced memory accuracy and lower-confidence recognition, and (3) the encoding weight must be modulated by the prediction error to account for the experimental data. Our modeling results show that prediction-error-driven competition between updating and differentiation can emerge from intrinsic network dynamics alone.",

      "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

      "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
      "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",
