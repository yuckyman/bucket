      "title": "Morphological details contribute to neuronal response variability within the same cell type",
      "content": "A large body of literature offers an explanation on how biophysical diversity and variable branching patterns of neurons contribute to degeneracy, and therefore enable multiple solutions for a characteristic neuronal response. The specific influence of finer morphological details, such as diameter and length of dendritic branches, on response variability is yet unclear. In this study, we address this question using a model database approach with spatially extended, conductance-based compartmental models to study variability of response features, such as resting membrane potential, input resistance, spike count, first spike latency, spike height, and spike width. Using 15 reconstructed morphologies of leech touch cells with fixed branching patterns, we identified several thousands of parameter sets that reproduced the experimentally measured response features of all the tested morphologies. Even when the biophysical parameters were kept equal across reconstructed morphologies, variability in response features arose from the morphological details. Systematically varying the distribution of ion channels across the neuronal membrane revealed that all spike response features are influenced by the location of spike initiation zones with higher conductance density. Nevertheless, biologically plausible responses can arise from different locations of spike initiation zones and even homogeneous distribution of ion channels. Furthermore, comparing the simulated spike responses from two morphological subtypes of leech touch cells revealed that the previously published systematic differences cannot be explained by the morphological differences alone. A larger total conductance was required to reproduce the experimental finding of an increased spike count and a larger spike amplitude in a morphological subtype with a larger membrane area. In conclusion, biophysical properties, morphological details, and ion channel distribution across the membrane all interact in their contribution to the functionality and response variability of neurons of the same cell type.",

      "title": "Encoding of motor sequences in primate globus pallidus and motor cortex: Uniform preference for ordinal position",
      "content": "How the brain organizes discrete actions into fluid sequences is a central problem in motor neuroscience. Competing models of basal ganglia (BG) function propose that BG neurons either signal sequence boundaries or encode movements across ordinal positions. Prior studies have largely examined fixed sequences with end-of-sequence rewards, leaving open whether such findings generalize to more naturalistic conditions. We trained four rhesus macaques to perform a visuomotor sequence task requiring four or five out-and-back joystick movements to peripheral targets. Sequences were completed under two conditions: a random condition, in which target order varied across trials, and a fixed condition, in which order was predictable and consistent. Rewards were delivered after each movement, dissociating reward timing from sequence completion. We recorded single-unit activity in arm-related regions of the globus pallidus (GP; n = 458) and primary motor cortex (M1; n = 306). Regression analyses revealed that many neurons in both GP and M1 encoded ordinal position within a sequence. Order effects were more frequent in the fixed condition, but were also present during random sequences. We found no evidence for preferential encoding of sequence initiation or termination in overlearned sequences, in contrast to prior studies reporting start/stop signals in basal ganglia. Weak effects appeared under the random condition in one animal pair, but these did not generalize across animals or conditions. Instead, neurons exhibited heterogeneous order-related responses spanning the full sequence. These results demonstrate that GP neurons, like those in M1, encode ordinal position throughout a sequence rather than acting solely as sequence initiators or terminators. This challenges boundary-specific models of BG function and highlights a broader role for the BG in representing serial order during motor sequence production.",

      "title": "Hypoplasticity in sensory-driven neocortical circuits of the Fragile X syndrome mouse model",
      "content": "Sensory experience and learning are tightly linked to plasticity in neocortical circuits. Repetitive sensory stimulation, such as rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS) at behaviourally relevant frequencies (8 Hz), can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses in typically developing mice. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a leading monogenically inherited form of intellectual disability, is associated with altered tactile reactivity, where non-noxious touch can be aversive. To investigate how sensory-evoked plasticity is altered in FXS, we combined ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of layer (L) 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the Somatosensory (S1) cortex of adult male Fragile X mouse model (Fmr1-/y) mice and typically developing (Fmr1+/y) control littermates. We found that plasticity induced by repetitive sensory stimulation was impaired in Fmr1-/y mice ex and in vivo compared to controls. L4-evoked subthreshold synaptic responses were hyperexcitable in L2/3 PNs, consistent with circuit-level disinhibition. Despite this, baseline intrinsic spiking evoked by current steps remained largely unchanged and whisker-evoked activity appeared diminished in vivo. We observed a shortening of the axon initial segment (AIS) in L2/3 in Fmr1-/y compared to control mice, which may reveal a potential mechanism to explain why subthreshold hyperexcitability did not induce more spiking. We also observed an increase in adaptation to the repetitive stimulation in Fmr1-/y mice compared to controls, which may underlie failure to induce plasticity. Together, these findings suggest that L2/3 PNs of S1 in Fmr1-/y mice are locked in a hypoplastic state, potentially related to disrupted inhibitory control, AIS shortening, and rapid adaptation during repetitive sensory stimulation. As somatosensory processes underly tactile perception, these findings may potentially underly altered tactile reactivity in FXS.",

      "content": "Arousal is essential for survival, and maladaptive arousal processing leads to an inability to focus, anxiety-like behavior, and dysregulated affective states. Norepinephrine (NE) is known to regulate anxiety, arousal, and learning through locus coeruleus (LC) projections throughout the brain. Evidence for co-release of the NE precursor and neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) from LC neurons has been accumulating for years, yet definitive measures of DA release across regions, stimulus paradigms, and behaviors associated with the LC-NE system remain controversial. Here, we identified the physiological and behavioral properties that evoke DA release from LC axon terminals. Using concomitant approaches, we inhibited the LC and ventral tegmental area (VTA) to selectively isolate the contributions of LC-derived DA release. Together these findings establish the constraints by which LC neurons release DA in a modality-dependent manner.",

      "content": "To move through the world, animals extract visual features from objects. Although visual object encoding is considered a cortical attribute, subcortical areas also contain visual processing circuits. Using electrophysiological recordings of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) located in a target region of the primary visual cortex, we identified striatal modules that process basic visual features. SPNs from the direct and indirect pathways exhibited high orientation selectivity in the absence of behavioral contingencies. SPNs population activity reliably predicted different visual features. Pathway-specific silencing of SPNs revealed that high orientation selectivity depends on intra-striatal connectivity. Thus, specialized striatal modules are active participants in visual feature extraction. These findings indicate parallel visual information processing in basal ganglia circuits, expanding current models of visual perception beyond cortical networks.",

      "content": "Stress-related psychiatric pathologies (e.g., rumination in depression, intrusive memories in PTSD) involve impaired inhibitory control over emotional memories and disrupted cortisol circadian rhythms. However, how these mechanisms interact to support adaptive forgetting remains unclear. Here, by integrating multi-modal neuroendocrine profiling with fMRI-based memory suppression in 90 participants, we demonstrate that the cortisol awakening response (CAR)--a circadian surge priming the brain for daily demands--proactively and selectively enhances suppression of recently acquired but not overnight-consolidated emotional memories. This time-dependent facilitation manifests through dual neural mechanisms: Robust CAR broadly amplifies dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) engagement during suppression attempts and specifically strengthens top-down dlPFC control over hippocampal-striatal circuits exclusively for recent traces. Our findings bridge circadian biology, systems neuroscience, and clinical psychopathology to establish CAR as a neuroendocrine preparedness mechanism that proactively configures adaptive forgetting circuits across sleep-wake cycles, thereby informing circadian-based interventions for stress disorders.",

      "content": "Vesicles are critical components of neurons that package neurotransmitters and neuropeptides for their release, in order to communicate with other neurons and cells. However, due to their small size, the reconstruction of the full vesicle endowment across an entire neuronal morphology remains challenging. To achieve this, we have used, as a tool to identify and visualize vesicles, Volume Electron Microscopy (vEM), a method that has the nanoscale resolution to detect individual vesicle boundaries, content, and 3D locations. However, the large volume of vEM datasets poses a challenge in the segmentation, classification, and spatial analysis of tens of thousands of vesicles and their target cell in 3D. Here we report the development of VesiclePy, an integrated pipeline for automated segmentation, classification, proofreading, and spatial analysis of vesicles, relative to neuron masks in large-volume electron microscopy data. Our package integrates the efficiency of deep learning and the accuracy of human proofreading and provides a streamlined package in chunked processing and accurate indexing, localization, and visualization of single vesicle resolution in large vEM data. We demonstrate the viability of VesiclePy using high-pressure frozen serial EM data of Hydra vulgaris and quantify the performance of the package using ground truth manual annotations. We show that VesiclePy can process a multiterabyte serial EM dataset, efficiently annotate 53,851 vesicles from 20 complete neurons, and classify vesicles into 5 types. Each vesicle has a unique ID and 3D location for further spatial analysis in relation to neuron or non-neuronal targets nearby. Finally, by combining vesicle data and morphological information of each neuron, we can quantitatively cluster neurons into subtypes.

Adolescent stress has been linked to enhanced risk for OUD in humans, however attempts to model this preclinically have yielded mixed results. Additionally, few studies have explored whether adolescent stress modulates the reinforcing effects of prescription opioids. Here we investigate the impact of acute adolescent stress on oxycodone self-administration in male and female rats. Methods: Adolescent male and female rats underwent acute restraint stress during concurrent exposure to predator odor, or control handling. Approximately one week later, subjects were allowed to acquire IV oxycodone self-administration (0.03 mg/kg/inf) over 10 sessions (2 h/day) under a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement. Following three additional FR1 sessions and seven sessions under FR3, rats underwent two progressive-ratio tests (0.03 mg/kg/inf and 0.06 mg/kg/inf, respectively). Separate groups of adolescent rats underwent similar experimental manipulations but were trained on sucrose reinforcement. Results: Adolescent stress did not affect the rate of acquisition of IV oxycodone self-administration. However, oxycodone self-administration escalated during post-acquisition FR1 sessions and remained elevated during FR3 sessions in stressed rats as compared to unstressed controls. Adolescent stress exposure did not affect responding during progressive-ratio tests, nor did it affect any measure of sucrose pellet reinforcement. Conclusions: The present results are the first to demonstrate adolescent stress-induced enhancement of oxycodone reinforcement in rats and provide a preclinical model for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms by which adolescent stress increases vulnerability for prescription opioid misuse.",
