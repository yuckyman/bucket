This results in idle SMs/VRAM when job isn\u2019t saturating.<br /> WoolyAI's software stack enables users to run concurrent jobs on a GPU while ensuring deterministic performance. In the WoolyAI software stack, the GPU SMs are managed dynamically across concurrent kernel executions to ensure no idle time and 100% utilization at all times. </p> <p>WoolyAI software stack also enables users to:<br /> 1. Run their ML jobs on CPU-only infrastructure with remote kernel execution on a shared GPU pool.<br /> 2.

While it can be extended for production, it's best suited for developers who value rapid development and a single-language stack over the complexities of a decoupled frontend for these specific use cases.</p> <h3><strong>Comparison</strong></h3> <ul> <li><p><strong>vs. JS Frontend (React/Vue):</strong> This stack is the industry standard for complex, public-facing applications. The primary difference is that this template <strong>eliminates the Node.js toolchain and build process</strong>. It's designed for efficiency when a separate JS frontend is overkill.</p></li> <li><p><strong>vs. Streamlit:</strong> These are excellent for creating linear, data-centric dashboards. This template's use of NiceGUI provides <strong>more granular control over page layout and component placement</strong>, making it better for building applications with a more traditional, multi-page web structure and complex, non-linear user workflows.</p></li> </ul> <h3><strong>Source &amp; Blog</strong></h3> <ul> <li> <strong>Source Code:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/jaehyeon-kim/nicegui-fastapi-template\">https://github.com/jaehyeon-kim/nicegui-fastapi-template</a></li> <li> <strong>Blog Post / Docs:</strong> <a href=\"https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2025-11-19-fastapi-nicegui-template/\">https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2025-11-19-fastapi-nicegui-template/</a></li> </ul> <p>The project is stable and ready to be used as a starter.

      "content": "Objective. Passive brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) has gained traction as reliable method for monitoring human vigilance in attention-demanding critical contexts. Unfortunately, the lack of extensive public datasets compromises artificial intelligence (AI) research. Proposing a solution to this issue, we augmented two EEG datasets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Furthermore, we defined a quality-assessment pipeline to overcome the absence of a univocal method to test synthetic data. Approach. Using GAN, we augmented a publicly resting-state EEG dataset sustained attention to response task and a custom one simulating activity during repetitive tasks. After extracting relevant time-variant rhythms via the continuous wavelet transform, we quantitatively compared synthetic data with the real one using L2 distance and cross-correlation function. To evaluate the impact of data augmentation, we trained six forecasting models, three on the original and three on the augmented datasets, over the whole, half and a quarter of total available data, and compared improvements in MAE and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). To study the forecaster\u2019s embeddings, we computed a metric inspired by the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) between latent values of real and synthetic data. Finally, to offer a baseline comparison, we extended the performance and embeddings analysis to data generated by a simple linear interpolation method. Main results. The integration of GAN-produced synthetic data improved signal prediction, as evidenced by a 29.0%, 46.4%, 37.4% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for splits of the resting-state dataset, and an average MAE reduction of 15.4%, 21.2% for 100% and 50% splits, and a \u223c2.5% increase for the 25% split. Conversely, training on interpolated data manifests worse performance and denotes extremely small FID distances w.r.t real signals, a sign of overspecialization. Significance. This study contributes a reproducible and complete framework for EEG signal generation and evaluation, addressing one of the main barriers to scalable AI application in BCI.",

      "title": "Finite element model predicts micromotion-induced strain profiles that correlate with the functional performance of Utah arrays in humans and non-human primates",
      "content": "Objective. Utah arrays are widely used in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) for intracortical brain\u2013computer interfaces, primarily for detecting electrical signals from cortical tissue to decode motor commands. Recently, these arrays have also been applied to deliver electrical stimulation aimed at restoring sensory functions. A key challenge limiting their longevity is the micromotion between the array and cortical tissue, which may induce mechanical strain in surrounding tissue and contribute to performance decline. This strain, due to mechanical mismatch, can exacerbate glial scarring around the implant, reducing the efficacy of Utah arrays in recording neuronal activity and delivering electrical stimulation. Approach. To investigate this, we employed a finite element model to predict tissue strains resulting from micromotion. Main results. Our findings indicated that strain profiles around edge and corner electrodes were greater than those around interior shanks, affecting both maximum and average strains within 50 \u00b5m of the electrode tip. We then correlated these predicted tissue strains with in-vivo electrode performance metrics. We found negative correlations between 1 kHz impedance and tissue strains in human motor arrays and NHP area V4 arrays at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-implantation. In human motor arrays, the peak-to-peak waveform voltage and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spontaneous activity were also negatively correlated with strain. Conversely, we observed a positive correlation between the evoked SNR of multi-unit activity and strain in NHP area V4 arrays. Significance. This study establishes a spatial dependence of electrode performance in Utah arrays that correlates with tissue strain.",

      "title": "Iris 128x: open-source 128 channel headstages for neural stimulation and recording",
      "content": "Objective. Investigation into complex neural circuits necessitates interfaces capable of high channel count recording and stimulation. However, existing commercial neural headstages often have limited scalability, restrictive proprietary designs, and constrained bidirectional capabilities, which worsens accessibility challenges and compels researchers to reinvent tools rather than build on a shared foundation. Approach. Here, we present two open-source, 128 channel headstages\u2014Iris 128B and Iris 128S\u2014designed for integration with microelectrode arrays. The Iris 128B enables fully bidirectional interfacing, with stimulation or recording across all 128 electrode channels, while the Iris 128S provides recording on 128 channels and stimulation on 16 simultaneous channels, which can be assigned to any 16 of the 32 available stimulation channels. Both designs use Intan Technologies\u2019 RHS and RHD series integrated circuits for amplification, filtering, digitization and stimulation, and are available on GitHub. Main results. The headstages were validated through benchtop impedance, noise, and frequency response measurements, as well as acute in vivo recordings in an anesthetized rat. Results demonstrate low noise levels and reliable signal acquisition across all channels. Significance. By releasing fully documented printed circuit board designs for headstages, this work aims to take a step towards broader adoption of bidirectional recording and stimulation systems while increasing channel counts. Future iterations will focus on miniaturization and wireless integration to improve usability in chronic and freely moving small animal experiments.",
