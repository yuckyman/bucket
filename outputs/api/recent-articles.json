      "title": "Pro-endometriosis macrophage release of IL-33 is key for endometriosis pain and lesion formation",
      "content": "Endometriosis is a painful gynecological inflammatory disease affecting up to 10% of females. When released by sensory neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) shapes immunity, a process known as neuroimmune communication. We previously showed that nociceptor-derived CGRP polarizes macrophages into pro-endometriosis macrophages (PEMs) that mediates endometrial epithelial (endo-epi) cell growth and pain. However, the key mediators involved in this PEM-induced cell growth were unknown. Using unbiased approaches, we discovered that nociceptor-derived CGRP induces IL-33 production by PEMs. IL-33 binding to its receptor ST2 is key for endometriotic lesion growth and pain during endometriosis in mice as anti-IL-33 antibody treatment reduced evoked and spontaneous pain as well as lesion size. Chemical or genetic ablation of nociceptors or macrophages also resulted in lower levels of lesion IL-33, demonstrating a neuroimmune-driven mechanism for IL-33 production during endometriosis. In humans, we found that IL-33 is correlated with increased number of glands and fibrosis in lesions and that IL-33 expression in macrophages is also associated with genetic risk of endometriosis. We also provided evidence that suggests a dual role for IL-33 in endometriosis, in which, it is initially required for lesion formation and later for lesion maintenance only, and associated pain. Therefore, targeting IL-33/ST2 signaling may effectively treat endometriosis pain.",

      "title": "Spatial learning in multi-scale environments: Roles of hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex",
      "content": "Navigation cognition involves the learning of multi-scale environments and the formation of cognitive maps. How do humans build cognitive maps in multi-scale environments? Cognitive maps are thought to be organized hierarchically, with local representations for subareas and global representations for the entire environment. However, it remains unclear how spatial learning influences the representations of multi-scale environments and their underlying neural mechanisms across different levels of representation. In the current study, we built a virtual environment (VE) with four orthogonally positioned rectangular rooms, each containing eight objects at the corners. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed a four-session spatial memory experiment conducted over two weeks. We measured their brain activity by using BOLD-fMRI at two stages: pre-learning stage and post-learning, when they were judging the relative direction between the objects within the VE. We found that with the progression of learning, the subjects shifted from relying on local, directional cues to using more global representations of the environment. At the neural level, the hippocampus (HIP), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) played distinct roles in encoding spatial information across the two learning stages. Specifically, after learning, the HIP shifted from local to global representations, while the RSC and OFC supported the integration of spatial information across these representational levels. In addition, the anterior cingulate cortex was involved in forming global representations, facilitating efficient spatial processing as learning advanced. These findings revealed how spatial learning leads to adaptive shifts in brain activity, contributing to the formation of cognitive maps in complex, multi-scale environments.",

      "title": "Visual Attention in Peripersonal Space",
      "content": "Bringing the hand near a visual stimulus enhances visual processing. This effect is linked to peripersonal space (PPS), the body-centered region where visual and proprioceptive information interact. Despite extensive behavioral evidence, the neural basis of this interaction in early visual cortex remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how hand proximity modulates orientation selectivity in area V2 by recording single-neuron responses from two rhesus monkeys. The monkeys performed a fixation task while their hand was positioned near a visual stimulus while either being visible or occluded, and compared with when the hand was away from the stimulus. When the near hand was visible, neural firing rates in V2 were significantly higher, accompanied by sharper orientation tuning. In contrast, occluding the hand broadened orientation tuning compared to when the hand was away. These effects emerged rapidly after stimulus onset and were coherent across the population, demonstrating that PPS is actively prioritized during visual processing. Together, the findings reveal two complementary (feedback) signals in V2: a congruence-driven enhancement when visual and proprioceptive inputs align, and a mismatch-driven suppression when they conflict, indicating that V2 integrates multisensory cues to encode PPS and support action-relevant visual processing.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

      "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks).

To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",
