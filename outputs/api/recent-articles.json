      "title": "An Ultra-High-Resolution 17.2 T MRI Atlas (HypoAtlas) and Multimodal Pipeline to Study the Mouse Hypothalamus: Sexual Dimorphism and Lateralization Insights",
      "content": "Structural and functional insights into the mouse hypothalamus are hampered by its small size and deep location. Here, we leverage ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) at 17.2 Tesla to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution in structural, functional and neurochemical imaging of the mouse hypothalamus, including sexual dimorphism in certain nuclei. High-resolution ex vivo anatomical MRI enabled precise hypothalamic parcellation, improving on existing atlases and revealing nuclei previously unresolved by MRI. Diffusion MRI and tractography mapped intra- and extra-hypothalamic pathways, facilitating circuit-level exploration without a priori assumptions. Resting-state fMRI combined with independent component analysis identified novel hypothalamic networks, demonstrating the enhanced capacity of UHF MRI to detect deep-brain activity. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantified neurochemical profiles, revealing sexually dimorphic heterogeneity within the hypothalamus. Our comprehensive multimodal approach uncovers sex differences in hypothalamic anatomy, microstructure, and neurochemistry, emphasizing the importance of sex as a biological variable. This integrated pipeline offers a valuable resource for dissecting hypothalamic circuits and functions, advancing our understanding of neuroendocrine regulation, behavior, and disease mechanisms, with direct translational relevance.",

      "title": "Ultrafast Frame-Free Imaging of Neural Activity with Event Cameras",
      "content": "Frame-based fluorescence imaging has long defined how neural activity is optically measured. This approach requires acquiring all pixels within an image, regardless of whether they carry meaningful neural dynamics, thereby intrinsically coupling spatial and temporal resolution while increasing data output. Here, we introduce an entirely different, frame-free approach that leverages the sparse nature of neural activity using event-based cameras, which asynchronously report fluorescence changes as spatiotemporal events. Compared with a frame-based camera, our method preserves signal fidelity while eliminating the fixed trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and data rate, thereby reducing data output by orders of magnitude. Applied to hippocampal preparations we demonstrate that the frame-free approach can resolve both single action potentials and fast network dynamics over large fields of view at kilohertz rates, enabling scalable, ultrafast optical recordings.",

      "title": "Aging Converts Microglial Repopulation into Maladaptive Reprogramming that Exacerbates Cognitive Deficits",
      "content": "Background and Purpose Aging has been associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Microglial repopulation after pharmacological depletion has been proposed as a strategy to alleviate microglia-driven neuropathology. However, the effects of microglial repopulation on age-related cognitive decline remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how microglial repopulation affects the transcriptomic profiles of cortical microglia and the decline in prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Experimental Approach Young and aged male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Microglial depletion was induced by treatment with PLX3397, a CSF1R inhibitor, followed by microglial repopulation after drug withdrawal. Microglia isolated from the entire cerebral cortex were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing analysis. The visual discrimination test followed by the response direction test was conducted to assess sensory learning and attentional set shifting abilities, respectively. Key Results Repopulated cortical microglia in aged, but not young, mice exhibited aberrant gene expression patterns, including reduced expression of microglial identity genes, reprogramming of innate and adaptive immune-related gene expression, and derepression of neuronal gene expression. Furthermore, microglial repopulation selectively impaired visual discrimination learning and attentional set shifting in aged mice. Conclusion and Implications These findings demonstrate that aging converts microglial repopulation into maladaptive reprogramming that exacerbates cognitive decline, possibly through aberrant gene expression programs. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of this approach must be carefully evaluated with respect to specific behavioral domains and disease contexts, including aging.",

      "title": "Aging redirects prior expectations from perception to action",
      "content": "Aging profoundly reshapes how the brain integrates sensory evidence with prior expectations during perceptual decision-making. Combining behavioural modelling with high-density EEG, we show that older adults assign greater weight on prior information, resulting in stronger decisional bias and reduced sensory precision under probabilistic cues. Neural dynamics revealed a breakdown of anticipatory tuning in visual alpha rhythms, supporting sensory preparation in youth, alongside enhanced central beta activity, indicating a shift toward pre-emptive motor engagement aligned with expected responses. A data-driven decomposition further showed that, whereas prior-driven behaviour in younger adults emerges from a flexible interplay between sensory and executive oscillatory systems, it becomes dominated in aging by a rigid, response-centred mode. Together, these findings uncover a large-scale reconfiguration of predictive computations with age, marking a transition from adaptive sensory-executive coordination to a more automatized, action-oriented predictive strategy.",

      "title": "MEG correlates of empty subjects in Japanese control and raising constructions",
      "content": "Empty categories are unpronounced elements with syntactic properties that play a central role in theories of sentence structure. Although there are several types within these categories, the neural basis for distinguishing among them remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigate whether the brain distinguishes between two Japanese sentence structures: Control and raising. Although these constructions appear similar on the surface, they are argued to involve different types of empty categories. In theoretical analyses, the control-type empty category, which is called PRO, is often treated as an anaphoric element, similar to reflexives such as himself and herself, whereas the raising-type empty category is a noun phrase trace. Twenty-six native Japanese speakers participated in a reading task under three experimental conditions: Control, raising, and baseline. Source estimates were computed, and condition differences were tested using spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation t-tests. We observed late left-hemispheric differences at approximately 700-800 ms after the critical verb. The control condition elicited larger responses than the raising condition, with activity centered in the temporal cortex spanning the middle temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus and extending into the anterior insula and the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, the control condition elicited larger late responses than the baseline condition in a broader left fronto-temporal distribution, including the inferior frontal cortex, the anterior temporal cortex, and the insula. These results provide source-level evidence that brain activity in the left language network differs between the control and raising conditions in Japanese during online sentence comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that we can distinguish empty category types in the brain.",

      "title": "A robust low-dimensional manifold organizes neuronal responses to sustained input",
      "content": "Understanding how neurons transform synaptic input into spiking output remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Although neuronal responses are often described in hig-dimensional terms, it remains unclear to what extent neuronal input-output transformations are governed by lower-dimensional structure. Here, we examine the geometric organization of neuronal input-output relationships using intracellular current-clamp recordings from mouse visual cortex. By representing neuronal responses in a feature space capturing multiple aspects of spike timing and excitability, we analyze how response variability is distributed across dimensions. We find that neuronal responses are organized within a robust low-dimensional manifold that accounts for the majority of observed variance and emerges despite substantial heterogeneity in neuronal responses and stimulation conditions, indicating a general organizational constraint rather than idiosyncratic properties of individual neurons. Importantly, the identified low-dimensional manifold is not a trivial consequence of feature reduction but delineates a constrained response space within which neuronal input-output transformations are expressed. Together, these results reveal a previously underappreciated regularity in neuronal response organization and delineate geometric constraints shaping neuronal input-output mappings under sustained drive, providing a principled foundation for computational models of neuronal function.",
