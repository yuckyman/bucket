      "title": "Emergence of focal cortical hyperexcitability in the murine tetanus toxin epilepsy model",
      "content": "Focal epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders that may be caused by a large variety of underlying brain lesions. Long-term quality of life prognosis is often poor, and treatment options are limited. Despite significant progress in animal model sophistication over the past decades, a deeper understanding of epileptogenic processes on a mesoscale and microscale circuit level is needed. Here we model focal epileptogenesis in mice using single intracortical tetanus toxin injections and employ chronic in vivo two-photon and widefield calcium imaging with simultaneous EEG and behavioral video recordings (\"multimodal\" recordings) to follow epileptogenic changes over time. We observe a moderate increase in global brain excitability on EEG but, more strikingly, a gradual emergence of brief but intense optically recorded epileptiform events (\"microseizures\") that are spatially limited, peaking around 20-30 days after toxin injection and waning over the next 30 days. During these events, a majority of local neurons are recruited into extreme depolarization, yet there is considerable variability in duration and spatial coverage between events, depending on the proximity to the injection focus and the number of days elapsed since injection. Notably, EEG electrodes <3 mm from the focus typically fail to detect these events, highlighting the utility of high-resolution in vivo optical imaging for capturing all events in focal epileptogenesis. Single-cell patch clamp recordings in awake animals confirm that microseizure episodes are associated with depolarization block, during which the calcium signal remains high. Using chronic multimodal recordings, we detect an initial rise of interictal activity in local cortical networks during the first day after injection, followed by a layer-specific suppression and dysregulation of interictal spontaneous network activity in local cortical circuits preceding microseizure events, and low-level suppression when microseizures started subsiding. The chronic suppression in interictal activity is accompanied by relative hypoactivity of PV+ interneurons and concurrent hyperactivity of SOM+ interneurons. This integrated imaging-electrophysiology approach provides a powerful platform for unraveling circuit-level mechanisms of focal epilepsy and potentially for identifying and testing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.",

      "content": "The center surround structure of ganglion cells receptive fields is suited for edge detection, a first step towards image segmentation. However, in a dynamical visual scene with moving objects, it is less clear how the retina represents the boundaries of moving objects and therefore contributes to motion segmentation. Here, we show that the spatial selectivity of ganglion cells changes during their responses to a moving object. Specific cell types only respond to contrast changes near the edges of the moving object. Using a non-linear model to reproduce this result, we could isolate the mechanism responsible for this edge tracking behavior. Different types provide complementary representation of a moving object, some enhancing its boundaries, and may thus provide primitives for motion segmentation.",

      "title": "System-wide profiling reveals metabolic alterations in a G2019S LRRK2 knockin mouse model of Parkinson's disease: systemic depletion of pyrimidine nucleosides",
      "content": "Background: The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is the most common genetic cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with increased susceptibility to sporadic PD, which likely arises from the interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental exposure, and aging. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been implicated as an independent risk factor for PD, but the potential interaction between the G2019S LRRK2 mutation and metabolic stress in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We employed long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to induce metabolic syndrome in aged LRRK2 mutant mice, followed by system-wide characterization using multi-omic approaches, including metabolomic profiling, proteomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Results: We find that thymidine and deoxyuridine levels are consistently reduced across tissues in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice at baseline, accompanied by increased hepatic expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP). HFD exposure further unmasks disruptions in purine and energy metabolism in the brain and lungs of G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice, with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the ventral midbrain exhibiting the most pronounced impairment in oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional pathways. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that pre-existing metabolic syndrome unmasks widespread disruptions in systemic nucleotide and energy metabolism and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice. This conditional \"two-hit\" phenotype underscores the critical role of environmental factors, such as diet, in revealing metabolic vulnerabilities associated with PD-linked genetic backgrounds. Our study provides novel insight into potential metabolic targets or pathways for therapeutic intervention in individuals at-risk for developing PD.",

      "title": "The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulates the Functional Output of Human Taste Bud Cells",
      "content": "We recently discovered that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial surfaces, is expressed in both human and murine TBCs, but how it functions in these cells remains unknown. We postulated that CFTR may impact peripheral taste signaling at the level of taste receptor-expressing cells of the taste bud. To begin to test this hypothesis, we assessed how pharmacological manipulation of CFTR could affect the functional responses of human fungiform taste bud cells to prototypical taste stimuli (e.g., bitter, sweet, fat) using single cell calcium imaging and neurotransmitter (ATP) release measurements. We first established the presence of CFTR in these cells using immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. We next found that CFTR inhibition generally increased stimulus-evoked calcium responses but that the specific response parameters impacted varied across different stimuli, likely due to differences in signal transduction mechanisms and the involvement of store-operated calcium channels. For example, response amplitudes to bitter and sweet stimuli were significantly enhanced with no changes in the proportion of cells responding to these stimuli whereas the opposite trends were observed with a fatty acid stimulus. Additionally, bitter-evoked neurotransmitter release was significantly enhanced by CFTR inhibition, suggesting that this effect is reflected throughout the signal transduction cascade. Ongoing and future experiments are utilizing shRNA knockdown as well as intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology to further interrogate the impacts of CFTR. In addition to human TBCs, we have detected CFTR in mouse taste tissues. Moreover, we have mined mouse TBC RNA sequencing datasets to determine CFTR co-expression patterns to inform future cellular and behavioral experiments in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that CFTR can modulate the signaling output of the taste bud.",

      "title": "Characterization of Lysine Methylation During Neuronal Differentiation of LUHMES cells.",
      "content": "Over one-third of human lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs)-the enzymes responsible for adding or removing methylation on lysine residues within proteins-are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Consequently, several studies have explored the roles of specific KMTs or KDMs in neuronal differentiation, and alterations in histone methylation patterns have been identified. It is now widely recognized that KMTs and KDMs also target non-histone proteins, yet knowledge of how non-histone lysine methylation changes during neuronal differentiation remains limited. Here, we address this gap using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify and measure changes in non-histone lysine methylation at three different stages in the Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) neuronal differentiation model. We identify 74 lysine methylation sites with significant differences in abundance across differentiation. Our analysis reveals lysine methylation on many non-histone proteins involved in neuronal differentiation and neurodevelopment, including signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, RNA splicing factors, and transcription factors. Overall, this work broadens the understanding of non-histone lysine methylation in a neuronal differentiation model and offers a valuable resource of lysine methylation sites on proteins of biological and clinical significance for future research.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

I just want to do some task/project and checkout.\n- Fully remote will be ideal.\n- Salary can be on the low end.\n- I feel the world currently is too hyper-capitalistic and I don't think I fit in well. On top of that my country has a billion+ people and everything seems like battle for scraps.<p>Unless I hit home with some indie hacking/side project, I don't think this will be possible. I believe there must some niche apps/plugin/extension/ssydev roles for some crm/cms etc that might fit the bill.<p>Few point to note:\n- No, I'm not that depressed. I'm just deeply unhappy with the current state of things.\n- No, I'm not giving up on life.\n- It may look like I'm not be good fit for tech/programming jobs. But I still like tech and solving tech problems. I just dont want my life to revolve around it.\n- It could be that im not challenged well in my job. But I'm not sure whether I'd like to be drowned in work as well.<p>Thanks for any advice or hostile/dismissive comments you provide I appreciate it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468959\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46468959</a></p>\n<p>Points: 22</p>\n<p># Comments: 8</p>",
