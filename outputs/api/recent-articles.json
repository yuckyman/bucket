      "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Morphometric Latent Factors in Autism and Their Association with Receptor Profiles and Behavior",
      "content": "The profound heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a major barrier to developing targeted therapies. While dimensional subtyping using functional connectivity (FC) has advanced the field, the intrinsic instability of FC limits its power to identify stable trait-like biomarkers. This study provides a direct comparison of latent factors derived from both FC and a stable morphometric measure, Morphometric Inverse Divergence (MIND), within the same ASD cohort. We hypothesized that stable structural factors would provide a more behaviorally relevant and biologically grounded account of ASD heterogeneity. Our findings reveal an important dissociation between functional and morphometric features. Latent factors derived from morphometric similarity (MIND) significantly correlated with core ASD behavioral traits (SCQ, SRS), while functional factors showed no association. This dissociation was also found at the neural level. Specifically, we observed weaker structure-function correspondence in the ASD group compared to the healthy control group (HC). Moreover, the stable structural factors were linked to trait-like neurodevelopmental mechanisms: the association with the CB1 receptor (important for synaptic pruning) observed in the HC was notably missing in the ASD group. Conversely, the functional factors were associated with a state-like arousal system (the norepinephrine transporter, NET). Collectively, our results demonstrate that stable morphometric-based factors, rather than time-varying functional ones, are predictive of behavioral traits in ASD. This work validates MIND as a robust approach and suggests that the link between structural organization and its neurodevelopmental (CB1) underpinnings is a more powerful and stable target for developing biomarkers in autism.",

      "title": "Traumatic Conditioning Induces a Combination of Anesthesia Resistant Memory and Protein Synthesis Dependent Long-Term Memory in Adult Drosophila",
      "content": "Stressful experiences elicit long-lasting memory trace that often persists for life-time. Though storage of experience dependent memory is key to survival, post-traumatic memories are detrimental to the physical and emotional wellbeing. The generation of any form of long-term memory culminates from synaptic plasticity and potentiation through persistent change in protein synthesis. Drosophila has been a robust model for the study of memory mechanisms; olfactory memory paradigms have been enormously successful in elucidating neuroanatomical, molecular, physiological and signalling pathways underlying the process. Long-term memory (LTM) has been induced by protein synthesis dependent mechanisms followed by a post-learning consolidation process whereas a medium-term anaesthesia resistant memory (ARM) is mediated by the Radish protein in flies. Here we present a novel and simple memory paradigm in adult flies for inducing sustained stress-induced memory paradigm, where a single attractive odorant is associated with an aversive stimulus- copper sulfate, which provides bitter taste as well as sustained malaise due to toxicity. We find that the elicited memory is a combination of ARM and LTM which is dependent on the number of training cycles. The eight-cycle training paradigm leads to robust, CREB and protein synthesis dependent memory persisting for about 7 days. The mushroom body (MB) Kenyon cells neurons as well as the dopaminergic input neurons (PPL1 subset) are involved in the formation of memory mediated by enhanced calcium as well as synaptic elaboration in the {gamma} subset of the MB neurons.",

      "content": "Epilepsy often becomes treatment-resistant, partly due to impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) function. Enhancing inhibitory neuron activity via gene therapy may restore excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We developed a compact 410-bp glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 promoter (cmGAD67) that enables strong, selective transgene expression in inhibitory neurons while preserving AAV packaging capacity. When delivered systemically, AAV vectors carrying cmGAD67 preferentially targeted parvalbumin interneurons and supported effective circuit manipulation. To evaluate therapeutic potential, we expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) under cmGAD67 (AAV-GAD65) in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) epilepsy models. Systemic AAV-GAD65 suppressed abnormal delta oscillations, reduced seizure-like events, normalized anxiety-like behavior, and improved survival in a severe PTZ paradigm. Biochemical analyses confirmed increased cortical and hippocampal GABA levels, linking behavioral and electrophysiological improvements to enhanced inhibitory neurotransmitter synthesis. Prior clinical evidence indicates that AAV-GAD65 delivery to the subthalamic nucleus is safe and effective in Parkinson's disease. Building on this foundation, our findings establish the cmGAD67 promoter as a powerful platform for inhibitory neuron-targeted AAV gene therapy and highlight AAV-cmGAD67-GAD65 as a promising approach for treatment-resistant epilepsy and other disorders involving disrupted E/I balance.",

      "title": "Normative modeling of brain morphology reveals neuroanatomical heterogeneity and biological subtypes in major depressive disorder",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by high neurobiological heterogeneity, which hinders precise diagnosis and treatment. Traditional group-level neuroimaging analyses fail to capture individual differences, while normative modeling offer a promising approach to quantify individual deviations from healthy brain structure patterns, facilitating the identification of biological subtypes and offering a data-driven framework to dissect this heterogeneity. METHODS: Using 1,190 healthy controls (age 22-37), we constructed normative developmental trajectories of gray matter volume (GMV) across 246 Brainnetomedefined regions using Bayesian linear regression. Deviation maps were derived for 398 MDD patients. k-means clustering was employed to identify GMV-based biotypes. Then, the clinical characteristics and anatomical differences among these subtypes were explored, along with the post-treatment clinical features and treatment responses of participants who completed the 8-week antidepressant treatment within each subtype. RESULTS: Patients with MDD exhibited widespread yet individually variable GMV deviations. Clustering analysis revealed two subtypes: Subtype 1 displayed predominantly negative deviations in sensorimotor and occipital cortices, whereas Subtype 2 showed widespread positive deviations in temporal and posterior cingulate regions. Subtype 1 had higher extraversion and symptom-linked deviation patterns; in Subtype 2, deviation burden correlated with generalized anxiety. Longitudinally, Subtype 1's GMV deviation changes predicted symptom improvement, while Subtype 2's deviations correlated with baseline severity. CONCLUSIONS: Normative modeling of GMV reveals marked neuroanatomical heterogeneity in MDD and identifies subtypes with distinct clinical and treatment-related characteristics, laying a foundation for precision psychiatry and individualized interventions.",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Semantic reasoning takes place largely outside the language network",
      "content": "The brain's language network is often implicated in the representation and manipulation of abstract semantic knowledge. However, this view is inconsistent with a large body of evidence suggesting that language processing is neurally distinct from the rest of cognition. Here, we use precision brain imaging to uncover a set of brain regions, separate from the language network, that are engaged in semantic processing of both linguistic and pictorial stimuli. In three fMRI experiments, participants (total n=41 tested across 49 sessions) viewed sentences and pictures depicting simple events. In separate blocks, they performed either a semantic task or a difficulty-matched perceptual task. Across all three experiments, several areas in left lateral prefrontal cortex, left temporo-parietal cortex, and right cerebellum responded to semantic tasks for both sentences and pictures. These semantic processing areas are spatially and functionally distinct from the nearby language-selective areas, as well as from the multiple demand and default mode networks, exhibiting a unique response profile. Our results provide evidence for a new kind of selectivity in the human brain and pave the way for future explorations of the neural mechanisms that underlie semantic reasoning.",

      "title": "Gait transition mechanism from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion in the Japanese macaque based on inverted pendulum",
      "content": "The ability of non-human primates to transition from quadrupedal to bipedal locomotion offers critical insights into both the evolution of human bipedalism and the principles of complex motor control. While quadrupedal and bipedal gaits in non-human primates have been studied, the dynamic mechanisms underlying the transition between these gaits remain poorly understood. Japanese macaques trained to walk bipedally have been reported to utilize inverted pendulum dynamics to achieve efficient bipedal locomotion. Given the intrinsic instability of inverted pendulum systems, which can induce large changes in movement with minimal control input, we hypothesized that this mechanism also contributes to the gait transition. To test this, we developed a neuromusculoskeletal model of the Japanese macaque that integrates a detailed musculoskeletal structure with a physiologically inspired motor control system. Through forward dynamics simulations, we generated a variety of movement patterns by systematically parameterizing motor commands, including failed transitions that are difficult to capture experimentally. We then applied dynamical systems analysis using on an inverted pendulum model to examine the underlying principles of the transition process. Our results demonstrate that successful gait transitions depend on generating an inverted pendulum motion through appropriate control of the forward step length of one hindlimb. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how Japanese macaques coordinate their complex musculoskeletal systems to perform skilled, full-body movements in the gait transition, offering a deeper understanding of both advanced motor control and the evolution of human bipedalism.",

      "title": "Diminished spatial dynamics and maladaptive spatial complexity link resting brain network disruption to cognition in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Resting-state fMRI studies increasingly emphasize the dynamic nature of brain networks. While most approaches examine temporal fluctuations in connectivity, we focus on the spatial dynamics and complexity at voxel level - how networks expand and contract, and change their structural complexity over time. Using dynamic independent component analysis (ICA), we investigate the hierarchical structure of the resulting time-varying spatial networks, from their broad periphery to their most active core. We combine this with fractal dimension (FrD) as a measure of a network's spatial complexity and analyze temporal changes (dynamic flexibility) in a network and synchronized fluctuations between network pairs (fractal dimension coupling, FrDC). We refer to this approach as 'dynamic spatial network complexity and connectivity (dSNCC)'. Using a combined cohort of 508 subjects (315 healthy controls, 193 schizophrenia patients), we found that schizophrenia is associated with higher mean FrD in several networks, suggesting more irregular patterns/boundaries and a disorganized network structure. Critically, patients showed significantly reduced dynamic flexibility, indicating their networks are 'stuck' in a less adaptable state. This robust finding is evidenced by a synergistic loss of temporal standard deviations in both network volume and FrD across multiple networks and activity thresholds. This maladaptive complexity was associated with cognitive impairment, with several dSNCC measures showing significant associations with subject scores for processing speed, visual learning, and verbal learning. Higher complexity in these networks and more significantly, their reduced dynamic flexibility as seen in patients, were particularly associated with impaired performance. Furthermore, we found aberrant connectivity (FrDC) in schizophrenia, with certain network pairs exhibiting overly synchronized complexity changes. Our results demonstrate that dSNCC is a powerful tool for characterizing network dynamics and may potentially provide a measurable mechanism for maladaptation in schizophrenia, where the brain's inability to fluidly change its complexity may contribute to cognitive deficits and symptoms like disorganized thought. These findings highlight the importance of studying the intrinsic spatial dynamic properties to reveal the fundamental principles of brain network organization in health and disease. Our work represents a significant leap in complex systems neuroscience and provides a novel, quantifiable biomarker framework highly relevant for understanding and targeting other complex disorders characterized by network dysfunction, such as Alzheimer's disease, autism, or other mental health conditions.",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.
