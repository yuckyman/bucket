      "title": "Automated estimation of frequency and spatial extent of periodic and rhythmic epileptiform activity from continuous electroencephalography data",
      "content": "Objective. Rhythmic and periodic patterns (RPPs) are harmful brain activity observed on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of critically ill patients. This work describes automatic methods for detection of the frequency and spatial extent of specific RPPs: lateralized and generalized rhythmic delta activity (LRDA, GRDA) and lateralized and generalized periodic discharges (LPD, GPD). Approach. The frequency and spatial extent of RPPs is estimated using signal processing and rule-based logic. Three algorithm variants based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Hilbert\u2013Huang transforms (HHT) were developed for rhythmic delta activity, and three using derivative and time-based peak detection for periodic discharges. Annotations from three expert neurophysiologists served as the gold standard, and inter-rater reliability (IRR) and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to assess performance. Main results. We evaluated the algorithms on segments with 100% agreement on event classification (n = 389) and on the full cohort of 1087 segments (including disagreements). For the first subset, top algorithms matched or exceeded expert agreement for RPP frequency/spatial extent. RDA1b-FFT, the best algorithm for rhythmic delta activity, showed an expert-algorithm IRR of good to excellent with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 91% and 96% (MAE 0.13 Hz and 0.26 Hz) frequency, and ICCs of 85% and 66% (MAE 0.19 and 0.09) for spatial extent for LRDA and GRDA. For periodic discharges, PD2a, showed and expert-algorithm IRR ICC of 80% and 61% (MAE 0.41 Hz and 0.15 Hz) for frequency, and ICC 77% and 13% (MAE 0.17 and 0.40) for spatial extent of LPD and GPD. For the full cohort, IRR declined, but expert-algorithm IRR remained comparable or superior to experts. Significance. The presence of RPPs at high frequencies and spatial extent are associated with a higher probability of poor outcomes. The proposed algorithms for estimating frequency and spatial extent of RPPs match expert performance and are a viable tool for large-scale EEG analysis.",

      "title": "The significance of dreams and dreaming in the traditional culture of Luo people in Kenya.",
      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "title": "Attention to Psuedo-Tone Melodies Enhances Cortical but Not Brainstem Responses in Humans",
      "content": "Auditory selective attention, the ability to focus on specific sounds while ignoring competitors, enables communication in complex soundscapes. Though attention clearly modulates cortical responses to sound, whether and where this modulation occurs in subcortical structures remains disputed. Here, we use electroencephalography to record cortical and subcortical (auditory brainstem responses, ABRs) activity during a selective attention task. Human participants attend to a 3-note melody in one pitch range presented to one ear while ignoring a competing, interleaved melody in a different pitch range played to the other ear (Laffere et al., 2020, 2021). The melodies consist of pitch-evoking pseudo-tones formed by convolving a periodic impulse train with a brief tone pip. These stimuli allow us to measure both ABRs (elicited by each individual tone pip within a pseudo-note) and cortical responses (elicited by the onsets of pseudo-notes) simultaneously. We observed robust ABRs, but no evidence of modulation by attention. Conversely, cortical responses, measured by event related potentials (ERPs), demonstrated attentional modulation of the P1-N1 peak. We conclude that attentional modulation within the brainstem is not measurable in the well-defined peaks of the ABR, which themselves reflect processing up to the input stage to the inferior colliculus.",

      "title": "Loose coupling between Ca2+ channels and release sensors as a synaptic correlate of higher order brain function",
      "content": "In the mature neocortex, functionally distinct areas are built by the same archetypes of neurons, but depending on the area, these neurons and their synapses are engaged in very different functions, ranging from lower order processing of sensory information to higher order associations and cognitive functions. We found significant differences in the functional presynaptic nanoarchitectures of the same types of pyramidal neuron synapses, depending on whether they are located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Synapses in PFC operated with loose microdomain coupling as opposed to tight nanodomain coupling in S1. These differences were associated with significant differences in synaptic timing, efficacy and plasticity between areas. Our data suggest that the mature neocortex uses tuning of synaptic topographies to specialize seemingly identical types of neurons for their required function. They reveal microdomain coupling as a presynaptic structure-function correlate of higher order neocortical functions.",

      "title": "The Inferior Frontal Sulcus, not the Anterior Insula, acts as a late-stage attentional gate for the fast rejection of salient but irrelevant sensory inputs during cognitive tasks",
      "content": "The ability to prioritize behaviorally relevant stimuli is essential for efficient cognition, particularly in distracting environments. The anterior insula (AI), a key node of the salience network, has been proposed to support this selection process by detecting salient events. A similar function, however, has also been attributed to the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), located at the intersection of the ventral and dorsal attention networks. Here, we directly compared the respective contributions of these regions to attentional gatekeeping - the identification and rejection of attention-grabbing yet task-irrelevant \"false positives\" to preserve cognitive resources. We recorded intracranial EEG from 63 patients performing an attentive reading task designed to dissociate salience from task relevance. High-Frequency Activity (HFA) responses between 50 Hz and 150 Hz revealed that the IFS was the only region - across extensive sampling of the frontal and insular cortices - to exhibit consistent, subsecond response dynamics compatible with the filtering of false positives. In contrast, the AI did not participate in the analysis or rejection of distractors and showed only sparse, delayed responses to targets, suggesting a role in coordinating or energizing downstream cognitive or motor processes rather than in salience detection per se. These findings indicate that the IFS - rather than the AI - is the primary late-stage node for attentional gatekeeping during cognitive tasks performed under distracting conditions.",

      "title": "Multi-task Intracranial EEG recordings reveal a Comprehensive Role of the Human Dorsal Anterior Insula in High-Level Cognition",
      "content": "The dorsal anterior insula (dAI) is widely recognized as a cornerstone of human cognition. However, its functional characterization remains the subject of considerable debate and competing theories. Embracing a \"shift in viewpoint\" approach - defining a brain region's function through the observation of the same neural population across diverse experimental contexts - this study used intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from a large cohort of patients to investigate the sub-second neural response dynamics of the human dAI across a broad range of cognitive tasks, spanning visual category discrimination, phonological and semantic processing, attentive visual search, and verbal and visuospatial working memory. This within-subject, multi-task iEEG framework offered a robust basis for decoding the structure-function relationship of the dAI and for empirically testing key predictions of prevailing theoretical models concerning its role. Our findings confirmed the dAI's involvement in the Action-Mode Network and shed new light on the large-scale spatiotemporal organization of that network, while providing novel insights into the interplay between cognitive effort and efficiency.",
