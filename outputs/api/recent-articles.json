      "title": "Early reduction and impaired targeting of myelin-associated glycoprotein to myelin membranes in Huntington disease",
      "content": "Background. Huntington disease (HD) is a hereditary life-threatening disease marked by progressive neuronal loss and atrophy of grey matter structures, particularly the caudate putamen. Brain imaging studies have revealed that the degradation of the white matter occurs many years prior to symptomatic onset and neuronal loss, suggesting that the decay of brain white matter is an active contributor to the disease progression. However, the mechanisms by which the HD mutation triggers white matter loss is not well understood. Methods. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy were conducted to assess white matter pathology and explore the relevant mechanisms in CAG140 knock-in mice, which express the HD protein in the same way as patients suffering from HD and thus biologically replicate HD in human. Results. Western blot analysis of proteins localized at different layers of the myelin coat revealed that the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which is localized at the innermost layer of the myelin coat and essential for maintaining the periaxonal space and the integrity of the myelin sheath, manifested as an early and progressive decline in HD mouse caudate putamen. The loss of MAG was detected at myelinated axons and in fiber bundles in HD mouse brains at an age when the abundance of myelinated axons was normal. Fluorescence immunohistochemical studies found that MAG labeling was concentrated in the soma of a subset of oligodendrocytes, which expressed breast carcinoma amplified sequence 1, a marker for new oligodendrocytes. While their abundance was normal, new oligodendrocytes in HD mouse caudate appeared to be impeded in acquiring the expression of MAG and in targeting MAG away from perinuclear punctate structures to processes, signs of impaired maturation. Compared with those in wildtype mouse brains, oligodendrocytes in HD mouse brains had a reduced abundance of small vesicles whereas an increased abundance of large punctate structures in the perinuclear region, implying defective generation of small vesicles transporting MAG from large punctate structures in the soma to processes. The MAG-containing perinuclear punctate structures were negative for proteins specifying trans-Golgi networks, early endosomes, or exosomes but had a minor portion labeled with lysosome-associated membrane protein 1, indicating that the structures where MAG accumulates in the soma are derived from the late endosomal lysosomal compartment. Conclusions. Our study suggests that the decay of the brain white matter in Huntington disease involves a deficit in trafficking of myelin-associated glycoprotein, preventing its proper delivery from the soma of oligodendrocytes to myelin-forming processes.",

      "title": "Oxidation of \u0394FOSB at Cys172 Controls Hippocampal Gene Targets and Learning",
      "content": "Imbalance of reduction/oxidation (redox) in the brain is associated with numerous diseases including Alzheimers disease (AD), substance abuse disorders, and stroke. Moreover, cognitive decline can be caused by neuronal dysfunction that precedes cell death, and this dysfunction is in part produced by altered gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which redox state controls gene expression in neurons are not well understood. DeltaFOSB is a neuronally enriched transcription factor critical for orchestrating gene expression underlying memory, mood, and motivated behaviors. It is dysregulated in many conditions including AD. We showed recently that deltaFOSB forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond between cysteine 172 (C172) of deltaFOSB and C279 of its preferred binding partner JUND. This bond works as a redox switch to control DNA-binding, based on studies of recombinant proteins in vitro. Here, we show that this redox control of deltaFOSB function in vitro is conserved in vivo. We show that deltaFOSB C172 forms a redox-sensitive disulfide bond with JUND that regulates the stability of this AP1-transcription factor complex and its binding to DNA in cells. We also validate the formation of deltaFOSB-containing complexes held together via disulfide bonds in mouse brain in vivo. We show that exogenous oxidative stress reduces deltaFOSB binding to gene targets in mouse brain and that Fosb C172S knock-in mice, which lack a functional deltaFOSB redox switch, are insensitive to this oxidation-dependent reduction in target gene binding, demonstrating that deltaFOSB is regulated by a redox switch that modulates binding to target genes in the hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate that FosB C172S knock-in mice are less sensitive to cognitive dysfunction induced by oxidative stress. This evidence supports deltaFOSB as an important mediator of oxidative stress-driven changes in gene expression and cognition and implicates deltaFOSB as a possible therapeutic target for diseases associated with oxidative stress in the brain, including AD.",

      "title": "Uncertainty Shapes Neural Dynamics in Motor Cortex During Reaching",
      "content": "Voluntary reaching movements are often made with incomplete information about the movement goal, which may require the brain to flexibly adjust motor plans and ongoing movements. To examine how uncertainty about a reach target influences neural preparation and execution, we recorded activity from dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices of a rhesus macaque trained to reach to one of two potential targets. In the task, a timing cue flashed three times in succession. Potential targets were displayed at the time of the first flash and the monkey needed to initiate the movement almost simultaneously with the third flash. Colorings of potential targets indicated the probability that the target would be at one location or the other, thereby inducing varying levels of uncertainty about the final target location. On half the trials, the final target was displayed so late that the monkey had to \"guess\" the target location, based on cues provided by the potential targets. While the monkey performed this task, we recorded 165 neurons from PMd and 37 from M1. Population neural trajectories in the preparatory subspace of PMd (but not M1) were progressively less expansive with higher levels of uncertainty. Despite differences in preparatory states associated with uncertainty, the movements produced were the same. The narrower separation between states suggested a neural-based explanation for more rapid movement re-preparation with higher uncertainty. Furthermore, we found a dimension in neural state-space representing the level of uncertainty during movement preparation and execution.",

      "title": "Chronic Dietary Exposure to Methylparaben and Ethyl paraben Induces Developmental, Biochemical, and Behavioural Toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "Abstract Parabens, particularly methylparaben (MP) and ethylparaben (EP), are extensively used preservatives in cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals. Although considered safe at low concentrations, recent evidence questions their biological inertness under chronic exposure. This study evaluated the developmental, biochemical, and behavioural effects of continuous dietary MP and EP exposure in Drosophila melanogaster, an established in vivo model for toxicological screening. Flies were chronically exposed to MP (0.5 to 2%) or EP (0.5 to 1.5%) throughout development and adulthood. Developmental timing, lifespan, oxidative-stress markers (MDA, FRAP, total protein), and locomotor performance (negative geotaxis in adults, crawling in larvae) were quantified. Paraben exposure significantly delayed development (a 15% increase in eclosion time), reduced median lifespan (up to a 50% decrease at 2% MP), and increased oxidative damage (MDA and FRAP) in a dose-dependent manner. Protein content declined more rapidly with age, suggesting oxidative degradation or proteolysis. Both adult climbing and larval crawling performances were impaired, indicating a link between biochemical stress and neuromuscular dysfunction. MP produced stronger oxidative and behavioural effects than EP. Feeding controls confirmed that observed deficits were not due to nutritional differences. Chronic MP and EP exposure induces systemic toxicity in D. melanogaster, integrating endocrine disruption and redox imbalance as plausible mechanisms of action. Given conserved stress and hormonal pathways, these findings reinforce the need to re-evaluate low dose paraben safety limits and highlight Drosophila as a rapid, ethically viable platform for screening environmental preservatives and safer substitutes.",

      "title": "Detection of probable neuronal gene expression changes in skin biopsies from patients with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy",
      "content": "Our inability to obtain nerve samples from the vast majority of neuropathic pain patients impedes our ability to understand the disease, creates challenges in understanding mechanisms in specific patient populations, and limits our ability to make treatment decisions based on quantifiable molecular data. Fields like oncology have overcome these problems to take advantage of the insight that sequencing offers for understanding mechanisms of disease and have leveraged these molecular insights to dramatically change the treatment landscape in the past decade. Here we tested the hypothesis that skin biopsies could be used to gain insight into neuronal transcriptomic changes in patients with paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). Our analysis reveals that hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found through bulk RNA sequencing in these skin biopsies are likely contributed by dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuronal axons and/or terminals. Up-regulated genes were representative of broad class of nociceptors whereas down-regulated genes were associated with putative injured DRG neurons expressing the PDIA2 gene. DEGs that could be confidently associated with specific subsets of skin cells were mostly expressed by keratinocytes supporting a growing literature tying keratinocyte-neuron communication abnormalities to pain in PIPN. Our findings warrant further assessment of skin biopsies in additional neuropathic pain populations to gain insight into DRG neuron changes that have previously been thought to be inaccessible in routine clinical or scientific assessment in most patients.",

      "title": "Biomimetic Cues Enable Predictive Mechanisms in Simulatedand Physical Robot-Human Object Handovers",
      "content": "Object handovers - while representing one of the simplest forms of physical interaction between two agents - involve a complex interplay of predictive and reactive control mechanisms in both agents. As human-human pairs have unrivaled skills in physical collaboration tasks, we take the approach of understanding and applying biomimetic concepts to human-robot interaction. Here, we apply the concept of passer movement cues, that is, slower movement for heavy objects and faster movements for lighter objects, to robot-human handovers. We first show that when a simulated passing agent's movement is scaled with object mass, participants as receivers adapt their anticipatory grip forces according to mass in a virtual environment. We then apply the same concept to a physical robot-human handover and show that our approach generalizes to the real-world. The predictive scaling of grip forces is learned iteratively upon repeated presentations of trajectory-mass pairings, whether the masses are presented in a random or blocked order. Overall we demonstrate that the presentation of robotic kinematic cues can provide intuitive and naturalistic human predictive control in object handover. This extends the use of non-verbal cues in robot-human handover tasks and facilitates more legible and efficient physical robot-human interactions.",

      "title": "Microglial morphology reflects cognitive status in the aging rat brain",
      "content": "Age-related cognitive decline affects millions of individuals worldwide, but the cellular mechanisms underlying this decline remain incompletely understood. Microglia undergo significant changes with aging, including alterations in morphology, that may reflect or contribute to cognitive dysfunction. However, the relationship between specific microglial morphologies and cognitive performance in relevant brain regions remains poorly understood. To address this, we evaluated the relationship between morphology-based microglial phenotypes and cognitive performance across domains affected by aging. Microglial morphology was analyzed in four cognitive brain regions of male and female 3-, 9-, and 15-month-old rats and features were subjected to hierarchical clustering on principal components to identify microglial subtypes. Rats underwent cognitive testing using a radial arm water maze and a T-maze set-shifting task to assess spatial working and reference memory, striatal-based learning, and cognitive flexibility. We observed age-related cognitive impairments alongside region-specific changes in microglial morphotype abundance. Importantly, the relative abundance of distinct microglial clusters correlated with cognitive performance in functionally relevant brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the hippocampus. Taken together, these findings highlight the utility of morphological profiling in capturing microglial heterogeneity and suggest that morphological changes may reflect or contribute to cognitive decline during aging.",

      "content": "Higher brain functions and cognition undergo a critical period of development during adolescence, when psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia typically onset. Understanding how developmental processes during adolescence interact with schizophrenia pathophysiology and risk remains a central goal in psychiatry. Here we show that a well-established biomarker of schizophrenia, mismatch negativity, matures during adolescence in mouse primary visual cortex, along with a strengthening of fronto-visual functional connectivity. Because microglia are implicated in schizophrenia risk and disease states, we further investigated what role microglia may play in the development of mismatch responses under physiological conditions. We found that microglial depletion with PLX5622 in adolescence arrests the development of resting oscillations in frontal areas, but does not affect the development of deviance detection, other signatures of visual context processing, or prefrontal-visual functional connectivity. Our findings suggest (a) a key component of mismatch negativity develops in adolescence, a period of vulnerability to schizophrenia, and (b) the development underlying this component does not require robust microglia activity, clarifying the developmental role of microglia in higher order visual processing.",

      "title": "Gene therapy-mediated overexpression of wild-type MFN2 improves Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A",
      "content": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) is the most common axonal CMT and is associated with an early onset and severe motor-dominant phenotype. CMT2A is mainly caused by dominant mutations in the MFN2 gene, encoding Mitofusin-2, a GTPase located in the outer membrane of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Mutations in MFN2 are known to affect mitochondrial dynamics. We previously demonstrated that the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln further disrupts contacts between the ER and the mitochondria, leading to progressive axonal degeneration. There is no effective therapeutic approach to slow or reverse the progression of CMT2A, and treatments currently under development primarily focus on restoring mitochondrial function. Here, we provide proof-of-concept that neuronal overexpression of wild-type MFN2 (MFN2WT) provides therapeutic benefit in transgenic CMT2A mice carrying the mutated MFN2Arg94Gln. Intrathecal delivery of an AAV9 vector expressing MFN2WT effectively targets motor and sensory neurons, restoring ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial morphology, thereby preserving both neuromuscular junction integrity and motor function. Strikingly, therapeutic efficacy is also achieved following vector injection after the onset of symptoms, rescuing the molecular hallmarks of CMT2A pathology and reversing locomotor. Notably, AAV administration was well tolerated, with no evidence neither of hepatotoxicity nor dorsal root ganglion inflammation. These results establish that boosting MFN2 levels using gene therapy is a promising therapeutic avenue for CMT2A",

      "title": "Representational Competition of Spatially and Temporally Overlapped Target and Distractor",
      "content": "Representational competition occurs when a task-relevant target stimulus and a distractor overlap in space and time. Given limited neural resources, it is expected that stronger representations of the distractor will result in weaker representations of the target, leading to poorer behavioral performance. We tested this hypothesis by recording fMRI while participants (n = 27) viewed a compound stimulus consisting of randomly moving dots (the target) superimposed on IAPS affective pictures (the distractor). Each trial lasted ~12 seconds, during which the moving dots and the IAPS pictures were flickered at 4.29 Hz and 6 Hz, respectively. The task was to detect and report brief episodes of coherent motion in the moving dots. Depending on the emotion category of the IAPS pictures, the trials were classified as pleasant, neutral and unpleasant. Focusing on three ROIs: middle temporal cortex (MT), ventral visual cortex (VVC), as well as the primary visual cortex (V1), we performed MVPA analysis to decode the distractor categories in each ROI, and correlated the decoding accuracy, taken to index the strength of distractor representation, with the accuracy in detecting the episodes of coherent motion. The following results were found: (1) the decoding accuracy was above chance level in all ROIs, and (2) in MT and VVC but not in V1, the higher the decoding accuracy, the worse the behavioral performance. These results suggested that distractor information was represented in V1 as well as in the two motion-processing areas, and in the motion-processing areas, stronger representations of the distractor led to poorer ability to process attended information, leading to worse behavioral performance. The hypothesis was thus supported and trade-offs in the fidelity of stimulus representations prompted by neural competition demonstrated.",
