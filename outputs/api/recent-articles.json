      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am excited to release version <strong>2.1.1</strong> of <strong>RedLightDL</strong>. This project started as a simple Python script, but it has evolved into a comprehensive tool with a hybrid architecture.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>RedLightDL is a specialized tool for downloading videos from adult content websites. It now operates in three distinct modes to suit different needs:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The New GUI (Graphical User Interface):</strong> <ul> <li>Built using a combination of <strong>C#, JavaScript, and CSS</strong> to provide a modern, responsive experience.</li> <li>Allows users to queue downloads, select quality (1080p, 720p, etc.), and manage settings visually without touching a terminal.</li> <li>Features a clean dashboard for monitoring active downloads.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>The CLI (Command Line Interface):</strong> <ul> <li>For users who prefer the terminal or want to run the tool on headless servers.</li> <li>Powered by <code>click</code> and <code>rich</code>, offering progress bars, colored logs, and robust argument parsing.</li> <li>Supports resume capability, auto-retry on connection drop, and config files.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>The API (Python Library):</strong> <ul> <li>The core logic is modular. You can import RedLightDL into your own Python scripts.</li> <li>It provides classes for scraping, extraction, and downloading, allowing developers to build their own tools on top of this engine.</li> </ul></li> </ol> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li><strong>End Users:</strong> The new GUI makes it accessible for anyone who wants a &quot;one-click&quot; download experience.</li> <li><strong>Power Users:</strong> The CLI is perfect for batch scripting and server-side archiving (<code>r/DataHoarder</code> style).</li> <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Those interested in <strong>Hybrid App Development</strong>. This project demonstrates how to connect a Python backend (handling the heavy lifting/scraping) with a polished frontend built with C# and Web Technologies (JS/CSS).</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Most downloaders are either purely CLI (hard for beginners) or bloated web apps. RedLightDL bridges the gap by offering a <strong>native desktop feel</strong> with the power of a Python scraper. Unlike generic tools like <code>yt-dlp</code>, it is specifically optimized for the supported adult platforms, handling their specific captchas or dynamic layouts more aggressively.</p> <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Core Logic:</strong> Python (<code>requests</code>, <code>bs4</code>, <code>rich</code>)</li> <li><strong>UI Layer:</strong> C#, JavaScript, CSS</li> <li><strong>Distribution:</strong> Available via PyPI (CLI) and GitHub Releases (GUI Executable).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Installation:</strong> For the CLI/API version:</p> <p>Bash</p> <pre><code>pip install ph-shorts </code></pre> <p>For the new <strong>GUI version</strong>, check the GitHub Releases.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/diastom/RedLightDL/releases/download/v2.1.1/RedLightSetup.exe\"><strong>GUI File Download Link</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Source Code &amp; Release:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/diastom/RedLightDL\">https://github.com/diastom/RedLightDL</a></p> <p>100% Made By Ai</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/diastom\"> /u/diastom </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqga1/project_redlightdl_v21video_downloader_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pkqga1/project_redlightdl_v21video_downloader_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Maan: A Real-Time Collaborative Coding Platform Built with Python",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I've been working on a side project called <strong>Maan</strong> (which means &quot;together&quot; in Arabic - \u0645\u0639\u0627\u064b). It's a live coding space where multiple users can collaborate on code, similar to how VS Code Live Share operates, but I built it from scratch using Python.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> Maan lets you code together in real-time with other developers. You can edit files simultaneously, see each other's cursors, chat while you work, and clone GitHub repos directly into a shared workspace. Think of it like Google Docs but for code editing.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Right now, it's more of a proof-of-concept than a production-ready tool. I built it primarily for:</p> <ul> <li>Small teams (2-5 people) who want to pair program remotely</li> <li>Mentors helping students with coding problems</li> <li>Quick code reviews where you can edit together</li> <li>Casual coding sessions with friends</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> Most existing collaborative coding tools either:</p> <ol> <li><strong>VS Code Live Share</strong> - Requires VS Code installation and Microsoft accounts</li> <li><strong>Replit/Glitch</strong> - Great for web projects but limited to their ecosystem</li> <li><strong>CodeTogether</strong> - Enterprise-focused with complex setups</li> </ol> <p>Maan differs by being:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Just a browser tab, no heavy IDE installation</li> <li><strong>Python-native</strong> - Entire backend is Python/Flask based</li> <li><strong>Self-hostable</strong> - Run it on your own server</li> <li><strong>Simpler</strong> - Focuses on core collaboration without tons of features</li> </ul> <p>It originated from a weekend hackathon, so it's not flawless. There are definitely areas that need improvement, some features still need refinement, and the code could use a tidy-up. But the core concept is functional: you can actually code alongside others in real time with minimal setup.</p> <p>Here's what's currently working:</p> <ul> <li>You can see others typing and moving their cursors in real-time.</li> <li>It's powered by Flask with Socket.IO to keep everything synchronized.</li> <li>I've implemented Monaco Editor (the same one used in VS Code).</li> <li>There's a file browser, chat functionality, and the ability to pull in repositories from GitHub.</li> <li>Session hosts have control over who joins and what permissions they have.</li> <li>You can participate as a guest or log in.</li> <li>It seems stable with up to 5 users in a room.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why did I take on this project?</strong> To be honest, I just wanted to experiment and see if I could create a straightforward &quot;live coding together&quot; experience without a complicated setup. Turns out, Python makes it quite manageable! I'm using it for:</p> <ul> <li>Solving coding issues with friends</li> <li>Guiding someone through bug fixes</li> <li>Quick remote collaborations with my team</li> <li>Casual coding sessions</li> </ul> <p>For those interested in the tech side:</p> <ul> <li>Backend: Flask, Socket.IO, SQLAlchemy (keeping it simple with SQLite)</li> <li>Frontend: Monaco Editor with vanilla JavaScript</li> <li>Integrated GitPython for cloning repos, colorful cursors to identify users, and a basic admin panel</li> </ul> <p>Interested in checking it out? \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://github.com/elmoiv/maan\">https://github.com/elmoiv/maan</a></p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback\u2014does the real-time experience feel smooth? Is the setup intuitive? What features would make you inclined to use something like this?

      "title": "Optimal feedback solutions recapitulate key features of motorcortical population dynamics",
      "content": "Neural populations display complex response patterns with marked transitions between distinct underlying computational strategies on very short timescales during motor tasks. Such complex-yet-structured dynamical strategies may reflect computational needs of neural systems, shaped by optimal feedback and autonomous mechanisms, in addition to biological constraints. Are there overarching computational principles that govern complex dynamical strategies exhibited by the neural population response? Here, we explore the hypothesis that computational strategies underlying neural population response represent optimal feedback solutions to the control of musculoskeletal dynamics through space for a goal. To validate this hypothesis, we develop a procedure called neural optimization using dynamical systems (NODS) learning to modify synaptic strengths within a recurrent network for locally-optimal feedback control of anatomically accurate musculoskeletal models during complex sensorimotor tasks. NODS learning works even when the objective function to be minimized is highly non-linear or the muscle model is very complex. The dynamical strategies underlying the neural network response constructed using NODS learning recapitulate key features of recorded population response. Importantly, optimal feedback solutions using NODS learning suggest that feedback mechanisms are essential for neural populations to flexibly transit between complex-yet-structured strategies. We further show that this framework provides theoretical foundations for why the solutions obtained using deep reinforcement learning algorithms extensively used to model sensorimotor tasks may explain the dynamical strategies underlying recorded population response. In summary, we develop novel methods and approaches suggesting that neural dynamics may be more strongly modulated by optimal feedback mechanisms, in addition to autonomous mechanisms, than previously appreciated.",
