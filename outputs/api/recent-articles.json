      "title": "Predatory orienting is jointly controlled by optic tectum and pretectum.",
      "content": "The optic tectum and pretectum have been implicated in hunting behaviour in several species but how activity in these regions is coordinated to control target-directed orienting manoeuvres is not understood. We performed two-photon calcium imaging across these brain regions in larval zebrafish, which revealed space and rate-coded premotor activity associated with graded, prey-directed eye and tail movements. Consistent with imaging data, intensity-modulated optogenetic stimulation of pretectum induced progressively more lateralised contraversive orienting behaviour and spatially patterned stimulation of optic tectum revealed a motor map along the anterior-posterior axis that primarily generated ipsiversive responses. Anatomical tracing and laser axotomies indicated that pretectal neurons control contraversive turns via a crossed pretectobulbar pathway whereas optic tectum shows topographically patterned output with a major uncrossed projection to hindbrain. Our data support a model in which premotor activity across pretectum and optic tectum collectively controls predatory orienting via both crossed and uncrossed (pre)-tectobulbar pathways.",

      "title": "Hippocampal indexing alters the stability landscape of synaptic weight space allowing life-long learning",
      "content": "Systems-level consolidation holds that the hippocampus rapidly encodes new information during wakefulness, and that coordinated cortico-hippocampal replay during subsequent sleep transfers and stabilizes those traces in cortex. This idea captures key learning principles, but exactly how replay reshapes the synaptic-weight landscape - creating new representations while preserving old ones - remains unclear. To address this, we used a biophysically realistic network model to probe the effects of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on synaptic-weight space. We show that previously learned memories are stable attractors in that space, and that hippocampus-driven interactions between sharp-wave ripples and cortical slow waves push the system into new attractor states that jointly encode old and new memories. As a result, replay allows recently acquired information to be incorporated without degrading prior memories. Our results offer a novel mechanistic - and conveniently 'geometric' - framework for understanding how sleep-driven replay sculpts synaptic weights during consolidation.",

      "title": "The role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in synaptic transmission during ischemia and recovery",
      "content": "Cerebral ischemia impairs neuronal and glial function, ranging from synaptic failure to irreversible damage. The effects of ischemia on excitatory synaptic transmission remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a detailed biophysical model including the first full implementation of the glutamate-glutamine cycle (GG-cycle), which is essential for proper functioning of glutamatergic synapses. We simulate a presynaptic neuron and an astrocyte in a finite extracellular space (ECS), surrounded by an oxygen bath, as a proxy for energy supply. The model includes ionic currents with corresponding channels and transporters such as the sodium-potassium ATPase. To model synaptic transmission, we combine calcium-dependent glutamate release, its uptake by the sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), and the GG-cycle, including glutamine synthesis. We simulate ischemia by blocking energy supply completely. The neuron enters a depolarization block, ion concentrations reach pathological values, and glutamate accumulates in the ECS while glutamate release is disrupted. Surprisingly, we found that synaptic transmission failure was not primarily caused by excessive glutamate release nor by failure of glutamine synthetase. Instead, it mainly resulted from EAAT dysfunction, driven by the collapse of the sodium gradient. Enhancing glutamate clearance alone was insufficient for recovery of synaptic transmission. However, inhibition of the voltage-gated Na+ channels restored ion gradients, recovered glutamate uptake, and re-enabled glutamate release. Taken together, our study highlights the critical role of ion homeostasis, in particular the sodium gradient, in maintaining synaptic function during metabolic stress. Moreover, the model provides a better understanding of synaptic transmission failure and potential recovery strategies during ischemia.",

      "title": "Crosstalk of noradrenergic Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in astrocytes of the murine olfactory bulb",
      "content": "Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and Ca2+ are ubiquitous second messengers that regulate gene expression, metabolism, and synaptic plasticity. Here, we identified a complex interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways in mouse olfactory bulb astrocytes. Norepinephrine (NE) elevated both Ca2+ and cAMP levels via 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors, whereas {beta} receptors triggered only cAMP responses. The 1 receptor agonist phenylephrine increased cAMP, but this effect was suppressed when Ca2+ elevations were blocked by Ca2+ depletion and removal of external Ca2+. We found that 1A and 1D receptors are key targets for phenylephrine, acting through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC3 downstream of 1 receptor activation. Moreover, 2 receptor stimulation raised Ca2+ levels, thereby stimulating cAMP production, yet also reduced forskolin-induced cAMP elevations, indicating that 2 receptors can both inhibit adenylyl cyclase via Gi and stimulate AC1/AC3 via Ca2+ signaling. Together, these findings reveal intricate crosstalk between noradrenergic Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in olfactory bulb astrocytes mediated by all three adrenergic receptor subtypes.",

      "title": "Toward precision EEG: Assessing the reliability of individual-level ERPs across EEG Systems",
      "content": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) are among the most established tools for studying the neural mechanisms of perception and cognition. Advancing toward precision EEG, however, places new demands for a better understanding of how reliable neural markers are at the individual subject level. We conducted two complementary experiments to examine the reliability of N100 and P300 components in an auditory oddball paradigm with three sounds (Standard, Target, and Novel). In Experiment 1, we evaluated the consistency at both the group level and the individual level across four EEG systems: one research-grade wired system (BioSemi) and three mobile devices - Smarting, DSI-24, and EPOC X. At the group level, all systems demonstrated the canonical N100 and P300 components; however, the EPOC X system showed a significantly reduced signal-to-noise ratio compared to the others. At the individual level, temporal and spatial clustering analyses showed that N100 and P300 components were detectable in most individuals (70-85%), with additional significant responses appearing outside this range. We further calculated the similarity of individual responses across participants (typicality index), which revealed highly consistent responses to Standard and Novel sounds, alongside divergent patterns of responses to Targets. In Experiment 2, we assessed the within-participant reliability of N100 and P300 using a test-retest design. Results indicated high within-participant consistency of response patterns for all three stimuli, demonstrating that individual ERPs remain reliably stable over time, even when they deviate from canonical group-level patterns. The current study contributes to the ongoing discussion regarding the utility and reliability of ERP-based metrics for precision imaging and highlights important methodological considerations for their practical implementation.",

      "title": "Physical determinants of perceived vibration intensity: Insights from haptic feedback given at the wrist",
      "content": "Understanding how controlled mechanical vibrations applied to the skin translate into tactile sensations is key in advancing our understanding of somatosensory perception and using this in haptic applications. Prior research has established psychophysical thresholds and discrimination levels for vibrotactile stimuli, yet less is known about tactile intensity perception. Understanding the signaling of tactile intensity and how mechanical dynamics of skin transmission shape this is critical for providing effective graded haptic feedback. We investigated how modifying the frequency, amplitude, and waveform shape of vibration at the wrist influence free ratings of perceived tactile intensity. Two accelerometers recorded mechanical signals: one embedded within the vibrotactile wristband and another placed 1 cm away on the skin, enabling tracking of vibration propagation through the tissue. We found that perceived intensity was determined by all three parameters, but each had a distinct role. Vibration frequency exerted a non-linear influence, with perceived intensity peaking around 150 Hz, which also corresponded to the actuator's mechanical resonance, with lower secondary peaks for square and sawtooth waveforms in-line with vibratory harmonics. Moreover, square waves were consistently rated as most intense. Vibration amplitude provided a consistent scaling of perceived strength, which was strongly correlated with both actuator and skin acceleration, indicating that skin-transmitted accelerations retained the stimulation profile. We find that the skin acts as a non-linear, frequency-dependent mechanical filter that selectively modulates vibration transmission. Understanding these determinants provides insights for the design of wearable haptic devices and how these can be used to provide graded feedback during tactile interactions.",

      "title": "How to Improve the Reliability of Aperiodic Parameter Estimates in M/EEG: A Method Comparison and Recommendations for Best Practices",
      "content": "Interest in broadband aperiodic, non-oscillatory brain activity (1/f phenomenon) has increased exponentially over recent years, partly fueled by the development of tools to parameterize it (i.e., estimate its offset/intercept and exponent/slope) using the M/EEG power spectrum. Broadband aperiodic activity needs to be separated from narrowband periodic activity before its parameters are computed. A popular method, the fooof toolbox (Donoghue et al., 2020), is based on the data-driven detection of narrowband-periodic peaks, whose maximum number is set by the user. While increasing analytic flexibility, variability in the number of detected peaks may increase sensitivity to noise and reduce the reliability of aperiodic parameter estimates and the power of analytic pipelines. Here, we present an investigation of the effects of several analytic choices (e.g., number of peaks, spectral estimation method) on metrics indicating the adequacy of spectral parametrization. These metrics include the internal consistency (odd-even reliability) of aperiodic estimates, the number of outliers generated, and their ability to detect effects. Across two different data sets (resting state and task-based) we found a decrease in the reliability of intercept and slope estimates as more peaks were allowed to be extracted. To ameliorate this problem, we propose a theory-driven modification of fooof labelled censored regression, whereby the same range of frequencies expected to contain periodic activity is removed from all spectra, and the remaining power values are regressed on the remaining frequencies to obtain parameter estimates. This method shows superior reliability and accuracy compared to fooof. Our findings thus provide suggestions for best practices for estimating 1/f parameters.",

      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",
