      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Chromatin remodelling subunit SMARCB1 is implicated in dendrite development and complex brain functions",
      "content": "SMARCB1 encodes a core component of the BAF chromatin remodelling complex and pathogenic variants in this gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Coffin-Siris syndrome. The relationship between altered SMARCB1 protein products and severe functional brain changes in Coffin-Siris syndrome remains largely unknown. We performed cellular, molecular, and behavioural analyses of a Coffin-Siris syndrome mouse model with a heterozygous nervous system-specific Smarcb1 mutation. In addition, we evaluated general cognitive abilities, as well as cognitive and behavioural functioning, in individuals with SMARCB1-related Coffin-Siris syndrome. Smarcb1 mutant mice exhibited deficits in fine motor coordination and balance, as well as impaired spatial learning and memory. Furthermore, these mice showed anxiety-like behaviours and agitation when exposed to novel environments. The detected behavioural abnormalities could indicate impaired decision-making, which results in impaired risk assessment. Comparable cognitive and behavioural deviations were identified in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome and SMARCB1 pathogenic variants. Our analysis of the Smarcb1 mouse model revealed structural alterations in the brain, including decreased dendritic length and complexity of dendritic trees. These alterations may explain the observed functional impairments. Notably, our finding of reduced Wasl transcripts in mutant Purkinje cell nuclei suggests that dysregulation of actin polymerization may be involved in the discovered dendritic defects. Taken together, we demonstrate a link between the chromatin remodelling complex component SMARCB1, complex brain functions, neuronal structure, and a key regulator of actin branching.",

      "title": "Distinct neural routes for evaluative and informational social influence",
      "content": "Humans routinely revise their judgments based on input from others, but the brain mechanisms that distinguish evaluative from informational social influence remain unclear. We combined a preregistered electroencephalography (EEG) experiment (N = 87) with the Judge-Advisor System to identify how two common forms of social information - feedback and advice - shape judgment and decision-making. Participants made numerical estimates, received either feedback (good/bad) or advice (a specific alternative estimate) that was either close to or far from their own, and then revised their response. Across behavioral and neural indices, both information types showed proximity-dependent effects, yet diverged in their temporal dynamics. Feedback elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN) that decreased with confidence, indicating reflexive performance monitoring. Advice produced sustained late positive complex (LPC) activity whose onset slowed with higher confidence and lower proximity, reflecting deliberate integration of external information. For both, P300 amplitudes increased with proximity, consistent with the reward value of social validation. These findings reveal two complementary neurocognitive routes by which social information guides decisions: a rapid evaluative route engaged by feedback and a slower deliberative route engaged by advice. The results identify distinct temporal signatures of how the human brain incorporates others' input to refine its own judgments.",

      "title": "Olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit slow oscillations encode working memory representations",
      "content": "Working memory (WM), the ability to maintain task-related information, is fundamental to animal behaviors. Despite significance, there is limited knowledge on how it is orchestrated by the neural activity in the brain. Here, we show that the olfactory bulb (OB) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) slow oscillations (1-30 Hz) are augmented during WM, and furthermore, the pattern of these activities convey task-related information. Moreover, we find that the OB-mPFC delta and beta power-based connectivity is enhanced by WM. On the other hand, theta oscillations have the most prominent roles in phase coupling in this circuit. We also show bidirectional information transfer, stronger in the mPFC-to-OB direction, between the two brain areas. Furthermore, during WM, beta activity in both regions is tuned by the phase of local and long-range delta as well as theta oscillations. Together, our results suggest that the dynamics of OB-mPFC circuit slow band activities underlies WM, with possible implications for other cognitive functions in health and disease.",

      "title": "Tracing the neural trajectories of evidence accumulation and motor preparation processes during voluntary decisions",
      "content": "Voluntary decisions have previously been described by where they arise in the brain and how actions corresponding to one's choice are prepared. However, the processes by which these internally guided decisions are formed and translated into action remain unclear. We tested whether neural signatures of evidence accumulation and motor preparation -- established in perceptual decision-making -- are also observed during voluntary decisions. Forty-nine adults made voluntary (free choice between two options) and forced (single specified choice) decisions while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. To isolate decision formation from action selection, all responses were made with a right-handed keypress. After applying signal deconvolution and current source density transformations, we examined three signals: the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), Mu/Beta (8 -- 30 Hz) amplitudes, and a left-hemisphere readiness potential contralateral to the response hand. For both voluntary and forced decisions, CPP and Mu/Beta amplitudes showed hallmark accumulation-to-bound dynamics -- faster responses had steeper ramping signals that converged to stereotyped pre-response amplitude levels. The left-hemisphere readiness potential likewise showed convergence to a pre-response level but with less reliable evidence for RT-dependent slope scaling, resembling a late, effector-specific motor gate rather than an evolving decision variable. Waveform amplitudes across the time course of these signals also did not differ reliably between voluntary and forced decisions. Our results indicate that, like perceptual decisions, voluntary choices are also formed by a graded accumulation process that culminates in a motor action, with the CPP indexing an evolving decision variable and Mu/Beta indexing effector-specific motor readiness.",

      "title": "Nanoscale synaptic remodeling at corticostriatal circuits predicts flexible action control",
      "content": "Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental substrate of behavioral adaptation, yet the underlying molecular dynamics remain poorly defined. We tested the hypothesis that, within striatal circuits, flexibility relies on nanoscale remodeling of synaptic machinery coupling anterograde glutamatergic transmission to retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, a process disrupted in states of rigidity and aging. In the dorsolateral striatum, we found cell-type-specific facilitation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5)-dependent, endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression at cortico-striatal synapses of indirect pathway neurons in flexible goal-directed behavior, but not after training promoting inflexibility. Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) super-resolution imaging revealed that behavioral adaptation, but not rigidity, is accompanied by increased postsynaptic abundance of mGlu5 and diacylglycerol lipase- (DAGL), an endocannabinoid-synthesizing enzyme, and presynaptic CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In parallel, the nanoscale distance between mGlu5 and DAGL is reduced in postsynaptic spine heads. These nanoscale changes emerged within the time window required for behavioral updating. Intriguingly, the molecular densities of mGlu5, DAGL, and CB1 receptors predict the strength of behavioral adaptation. In aging mice, these nanoscale changes were absent in association with behavioral rigidity. These findings identify a nanoscale synaptic remodeling mechanism that enables behavioral flexibility and reveal how its failure contributes to rigidity, including that observed in aging.",

      "title": "Neural Substrates of Approach-Avoidance Control in Motivational Conflict",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior requires control over automatic tendencies to approach reward and avoid threat. Dysregulation of this control characterizes disorders such as anxiety or addiction, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated circuits engaged during approach-avoidance control using fMRI with concurrent eye-tracking, and behavioral measures. Forty participants (22 females) completed an approach-avoidance conflict task with free- and forced-choice trials. Each trial comprised anticipation, response (using a joystick to approach/obtain or avoid/forgo outcomes), and outcome phases. Before scanning, participants learned that conditioned stimuli (CS) predicted an aversive stimulation (avCS+), appetitive reward (appCS+), both outcomes (confCS+), or no outcome (neuCS-). Discordant responses (e.g., approaching avCS+) were slower than concordant responses (e.g., avoiding avCS+), confirming heightened control demands. Overcoming threat-driven avoidance specifically recruited the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), while suppressing reward-driven approach lacked distinct neural signatures. During anticipation, confCS+ and avCS+ showed overlapping activation in salience-control networks, including middle/anterior cingulate cortex (MCC/ ACC), anterior insula, IFG, and ventral striatum (VS). Interestingly, confCS+ evoked threat-like anticipatory neurophysiological responses (pupil dilation; ACC/insula activation) but subsequently triggered reward-like approach behavior. Multivariate pattern and psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that this dissociation was driven by differential encoding of upcoming responses in the ventral striatum during the anticipation phase and by altered functional coupling between the VS and the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ). These findings indicate that motivational control prioritizes salience over valence and suggest a VS-rTPJ network for resolving approach-avoidance conflicts, offering novel insights into neural dynamics of flexible goal-directed behavior.",

      "title": "PCSK9 and High-Fat Diet Synergistically Induce Neurovascular Dysfunction and Neuroinflammation",
      "content": "Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is strongly linked to metabolic risk factors and represents a major cause of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. The interactions of genetic and environmental risk factors driving cerebrovascular pathology in metabolic syndrome are poorly understood. Here, we characterize neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative phenotypes in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome with atherosclerosis induced by hepatic proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) overexpression combined with high-fat diet (HFD). PCSK9+HFD mice exhibit hallmark features of CSVD including vascular rarefaction, impaired neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier disruption, white matter injury, neuronal loss, and cognitive deficits. Notably, we identify lipid-droplet accumulating microglia (LDAM) as a distinct cellular phenotype that emerges in response to metabolic stress and correlates with cerebrovascular dysfunction. Three-dimensional light sheet microscopy reveals widespread vascular network disruption. Immunophenotyping demonstrates that microglia in PCSK9+HFD group exhibit enhanced phagocytic activation and ramification complexity yet accumulate perivascular amyloid-{beta}, suggesting impaired clearance capacity. Importantly, we observed vascular amyloid-{beta} deposition in wild-type mice without genetic Alzheimer's disease mutations, suggesting that metabolic stress contributes to cerebrovascular amyloid pathology. PCSK9+HFD mice displayed recognition memory deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior. Our findings establish that severe hypercholesterolemia accelerates CSVD pathogenesis, and identify LDAM as a distinct pathological feature linking systemic metabolic syndrome to cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Position-dependent effects of SCN2A premature stop codons on neuronal excitability and behavior",
      "content": "SCN2A encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.2, a key determinant of spike initiation and propagation in glutamatergic neurons. Premature termination codons are often assumed to produce uniform haploinsufficiency via nonsense-mediated decay, yet whether distinct SCN2A premature stop codons yield equivalent molecular, cellular, and behavioral outcomes remains unknown. We generated two mouse lines carrying patient mutations -- Scn2aY84X/+ (p.Tyr84UAA; early coding sequence) and Scn2aR1627X/+ (p.Arg1627UGA; terminal coding exon) -- on a C57BL/6J background. Allele-specific expression was quantified by targeted next-generation sequencing of whole-brain reverse transcribed cDNA. NaV1.2 protein was measured in half-brain lysates by automated western blot and ex vivo whole-cell recordings were obtained from layer 5b pyramidal-tract neurons in medial prefrontal cortex. A panel of behavioral assays assessed locomotion/exploration, motor learning, anxiety-like behavior, sociability, sensorimotor gating, and seizure susceptibility. Allele-specific RNA handling diverged by position: mRNA carrying Y84X engaged partial nonsense-mediated decay, whereas R1627X transcripts were at allelic balance. Despite this difference in RNA fate, NaV1.2 protein was comparably reduced in both lines. Electrophysiologically, both premature termination codon mutations slowed the action-potential upstroke, with a larger decrement in Scn2aY84X/+ than in Scn2aR1627X/+. Spike threshold was depolarized only in Scn2aY84X/+, whereas Scn2aR1627X/+ remained similar to wild type. Frequency-current relations showed reduced firing at near-rheobase inputs in both mutants, with responses approaching wild type at stronger currents. Behaviorally, locomotion, sociability, and sensorimotor gating were preserved. Both lines exhibited increased grooming, consistent with restrictive, repetitive behavior; Scn2aY84X/+ alone showed greater exploration in the elevated-risk context and a male-predominant deficit in rotarod learning. In maximal electroshock testing, mortality was lower in both lines without differences in seizure threshold or severity. Our results show that distinct SCN2A premature termination codons are not equivalent to one another, nor to a uniform haploinsufficient state. An early, nonsense-mediated decay-competent premature stop codon (Y84X) and a terminal-exon one (R1627X) produce partially overlapping yet allele-specific effects on neuronal excitability and behavior. These findings establish premature termination codon position as a determinant of phenotype, supporting allele-tailored mechanistic studies and therapeutic strategies.",

      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has identified brain systems that reliably underpin specific abilities, including verbal short-term memory. However, there is no simple mapping between anatomy and function; moreover, brains are differently organised across people. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, and using transcranial magnetic brain stimulation to test causality, we characterised differences in the neural processes supporting verbal short-term memory in healthy participants who varied in their reliance on semantic information. In group analyses, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed the expected pattern for a 'phonological buffer' - this site was responsive to phonological tasks and verbal short-term memory for meaningless items. However, the functions of this site differed across the sample; individuals with the strongest semantic reliance in short-term memory showed weaker phonological responses. They also showed more activation when maintaining meaningful word sequences in short-term memory, compared with nonwords. In these semantically reliant participants, left anterior inferior parietal cortex showed stronger functional connectivity to limbic and default mode regions during nonword rehearsal. While inhibitory stimulation to phonologically responsive regions disrupted nonwords more than words in people with good phonological short-term memory, these effects were reversed when verbal short-term memory was more semantically reliant. These findings show that left anterior inferior parietal cortex supports the maintenance of different kinds of verbal information across individuals.",
