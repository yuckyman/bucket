      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

      "content": "Stress resilience is defined as the ability to maintain mental health after adversity. In humans, resilience is marked by threat/safety discrimination and extinction of fear, whereas susceptibility involves fear generalization and extinction resistance. Using a translational mouse model of chronic social defeat stress combined with preregistered multimodal brain imaging, we investigated structural and network level markers of resilience, susceptibility, and threat learning. Resilience was characterized by preserved dentate gyrus integrity, greater microstructural complexity in prefrontal regions, and signatures consistent with enhanced inhibitory gating within amygdalar circuits. Susceptibility, in contrast, involved reduced dentate gyrus complexity and diminished microstructural flexibility, with a weaker but parallel pattern in the basolateral amygdala. Impaired threat learning was linked to compromised CA1/CA2 integrity and reduced pons connectivity, highlighting hippocampal brainstem interactions in memory consolidation. Overall, these findings show that resilience emerges from adaptive network reorganization, whereas susceptibility and impaired learning reflect distinct dysfunctions, underscoring individual coping differences even among genetically identical animals.",

      "title": "Ask HN: Quality of recent gens of Dell/Lenovo laptops worse than 10 years ago?",
      "content": "<p>I have been purchasing used/new Lenovo/Dell laptops for the last 7 years, and I have noticed that the build quality of recent models is concerning.<p>Lenovo: Ex-company gave me a NEW Carbon X1 around 2019, and the battery only lasted for less than a year (!). On the other side, I bought a used 2017 470S from the same company, added more RAM, didn't touch anything including the SSD, and I'm still using it in daily coding. I did buy a new battery last month so technically the old batteries lasted for about 7-8 years.<p>Dell: I bought 3 laptops + 1 desktop from Dell Refurbished (So the quality should be consistent). 2 laptops + 1 desktop are older models, and 1 is Precision 5550 (2021) that I bought last December. Everything works fine, except for the 5550, which has issues with battery (dropped from 31% to 4% in a few seconds) and (more deadly) charging port (doesn't charge from time to time). Even if I bought it new in 2021, I would be surprised that it only lasted for a bit over 4 years.<p>The other issue is that 5550 uses USB-C ports. I blame on myself not checking it closely before the purchase. I really hate those ports. Why is everyone copying from Mac?<p>What's my option? I can't really justify the 2,000+ CAD price point for a new laptop, especially if it lasts less than 5 years. I'd prefer a \"low-end\" workstation with 32GB memory, but because of the price point I can only afford a 16GB non-workstation one. I don't do gaming any more but I still prefer a good integrated video card. I can't afford Framework and other Linux laptops because they are expensive and usually don't operate in Canada so delivery is expensive too.<p>I did buy a used Macbook Pro M1 16GB (2021) from my current company last month. I haven't used it but I'm confident that the hardware is good. The problem is I don't really like the software, so I figured I still need a Linux box.<p>Did you find any sweet spot?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46108071\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46108071</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "Deployable electrode arrays for brain interfaces: structural reconfiguration strategies for long-term stability and high-fidelity recording\u2014a review",
      "content": "Objective. Neural electrode arrays, as essential tools for recording and stimulating neural tissues, significantly impact therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders through deep brain stimulation, responsive neurostimulation, and brain-computer interfaces. Despite considerable advancements, the efficiency and longevity of neural electrode arrays are compromised by brain micromotion, induced by physiological activities such as cardiac pulsation and respiration. The mechanical mismatch between rigid electrode arrays and soft neural tissue generates persistent stresses at the electrode-tissue interface, triggering tissue damage, inflammatory responses, encapsulation, and ultimately electrode failure. Deployable neural electrode arrays, characterized by structural reconfiguration after implantation, have emerged to address these challenges. Deployment mechanisms, including unfolding, expanding, unrolling, or ejecting electrode arms from an initially compact configuration, reduce insertion trauma, maximize spatial coverage, and mitigate brain micromotion effects, thereby enhancing long-term stability and recording fidelity. Approach. This review provides the first comprehensive analysis of deployable intracortical and electrocorticography electrode arrays, emphasizing their design principles, deployment mechanisms, mechanical performance, advantages, and limitations. Main results. This review fills a critical gap in the existing neural electrode literature by transitioning the focus from traditional geometric and material considerations to advanced structural reconfiguration strategies. Significance. An understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of these deployment strategies provides essential insights and future directions for optimizing neural electrode technologies.",

      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Emergence of Value and Action Codes in Bimodular Spiking Actor-Critic Networks",
      "content": "Decision-making depends on coordinated computations distributed across dorsal and ventral circuits, often described as actor-critic systems. We examined how this division of labor gives rise to value- and decision-related representations by training a bimodular recurrent network on an economic choice task and transferring it to an expanded gated spiking model that preserved its latent dynamics while stabilizing the underlying neural representations. The two modules assumed complementary roles: the actor encoded action-value differences and spatial contingencies required for selecting between actions, whereas the critic represented object values predictive of reward. Neurons across modules were selective for object, action, total, and difference values, supporting decision- and confidence-related activity. Low-dimensional analyses revealed structured trajectories reflecting temporal evolution, spatial configuration, and value-dependent divergence. These results clarify how distributed circuits can jointly implement valuation and action selection, providing a foundation for linking reinforcement-trained recurrent models with anatomically inspired dorsal-ventral frameworks.",
