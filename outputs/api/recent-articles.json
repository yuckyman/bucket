      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

Advances in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have rapidly accelerated in the last decade that promises to improve the quality of life of patients with communications, sensory, and motor control disabilities. Approach. In this Perspective, we quantify the extent and nature of scientific convergence across 21 research groups conducting iBCI clinical trials worldwide. Using medical subject headers and Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomies, we analyze topical and disciplinary integration within 161 publications from 1998\u20132023 to assess how deeply team composition aligns with research themes and translational impact. Main Results. Our findings indicate uneven patterns of convergence, with many teams combining engineering and clinical expertise yet omitting ethical, legal, and social dimensions. This represents what we term short-cut convergence. Significance. We propose an operational definition of this phenomenon and identify practical steps for researchers and funders to strengthen full convergence to accelerate iBCI translation and implementation.",

      "title": "Electrical characterization and accelerated aging of amorphous silicon carbide implantable encapsulation",
      "content": "Objective. Chronically implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used for stimulating and recording neural activity in research and clinical settings. However, their reliability can be compromised by insufficient encapsulation stability. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), a chemically stable and biocompatible material, has emerged as a potential thin-film encapsulation for MEAs. We aimed to evaluate thin-film a-SiC encapsulation using electrical-accelerated aging (EAA) and to demonstrate a methodology for obtaining acceleration factors for EAA by Weibull analysis. Approach. Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) encapsulated with a-SiC were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped-voltage protocols to measure leakage currents in buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. EAA employed incrementally increasing voltage biases over time to induce degradation and reveal failure mechanisms. Main results. IDEs exhibited a significant change in electrical behavior on exposure to saline, with failure initiating at specific voltages and accompanied by gas evolution at defect sites. Incremental voltage biasing revealed a capacitive-to-faradaic transition in leakage current response that was used as a failure criterion. Significance. Acceleration factors for voltage-driven accelerated aging of a-SiC thin-film encapsulation can be obtained by Weibull analysis using a mechanistic failure criterion. Breakdown occurs at processing-related defects in the a-SiC. This study demonstrates the use of EAA for evaluating failure in a-SiC thin-film encapsulation used in implantable MEAs. EAA is broadly applicable to thin-film MEAs and provides a highly relevant method of predicting implanted lifetimes of bioelectronics.",

      "title": "sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing in a large adult and pediatric cohort",
      "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

      "title": "Co-Designing Research Priorities in Developmental Neuroscience: A Community-Based Participatory Approach",
      "content": "Children and adolescents, the primary participants in developmental neuroscience research, are rarely consulted or included in the research design process. By neglecting their perspectives and needs, we risk limiting the relevance and effectiveness of translational research that might emerge from such research. Here, we report on a process of co-development with adolescents in the UK city of Bradford to inform the generation of a new developmental neuroimaging research programme. We employed a two-study community-based participatory approach and used mixed methods to identify the research priorities of this community. In the first study, 79 secondary school students from four schools were introduced to fundamental neuroscience concepts during five one-hour workshops. In groups, they then designed research studies, centred around topics they deemed imported, and were asked to present their ideas on posters, role playing as neuroscientists. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on these posters, extracting ten key themes. In the second study, 387 students from four schools ranked the ten extracted themes in order of importance. Mental health and stress consistently emerged as the highest priorities across groups. Exploratory analysis revealed that the priority for themes exploring healthy routines and understanding anti-social behaviours varied across schools and the importance of mental health, and topics related to video gaming varied significantly between genders. This work provides an illustration of how a place-based participatory approach can inform the design of developmental neuroscience programmes, improving both equity and translational relevance.",

      "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I searched on the internet for RateLimiters limiters, there are many.<br /> Even the throttling strategy have many flavours like:</p> <ol> <li>Leacky bucket</li> <li>Token bucket</li> <li>Sliding window</li> </ol> <p>But all these RateLimiters are based on task completions. For example the RateLimit may be defined as 100 tasks per second.</p> <p>But there are many scenarios where all tasks are not equivalent, each task might have a separate cost. For example task A might send 10 bytes over network but task B might send 50.</p> <p>In that case it makes more sense to define the RateLimit not as the no. of tasks but the total weight(or cost) of the tasks executed in the unit interval.</p> <p>So, to be precise i need a RateLimiter that:</p> <ol> <li>Throttled based on net cost, not on the total no. of tasks</li> <li>Provides strict sliding window guarentees</li> <li>Asyncio friendly, both normal functions as well as async function can be queues in the RateLimiter</li> </ol> <p>Has anyone ever used/written such a utility, i am eager to know and i will also write my own, for pure learning if not for usage.</p> <p>I would like to hear ideas from the community.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Perfect_Evidence8928\"> /u/Perfect_Evidence8928 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q7e0tp/i_am_working_on_a_weightcost_based_rate_limiter/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q7e0tp/i_am_working_on_a_weightcost_based_rate_limiter/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Human Neocortical Glutamatergic Neurons Revealed Through Multimodal Profiling",
      "content": "The human neocortex underlies higher cognition and is the engine of complex thought. Yet our understanding of its neuronal diversity is limited by sparse access to tissue, inconsistent sampling across studies, and a lack of multiple modality data. Although single-cell transcriptomic taxonomies are an important framework for characterizing cell type diversity, transcriptomic information alone cannot reveal the cellular properties that define neuronal computations. To address this, we performed Patch-seq, a method for collecting Morphology, Electrophysiology, and Transcriptomic data from a single neuron. We focused on glutamatergic, neocortical, excitatory neurons, the principal long-range projecting neurons of the cortex, and systematically integrated their morphoelectric features with transcriptomic identity. In combination with spatial transcriptomic data, we interrogated 39 of 42 transcriptomically-defined neuron types with a layer-centric perspective. Morphoelectric properties, such as cortical depth, apical dendrite structure, and excitability clearly distinguish transcriptomic subclasses and support many finer transcriptomic types. Morphoelectric properties are influenced by spatial location in supragranular layers, while deeper layers exhibit greater heterogeneity. Cross-species comparisons reveal conserved subclass organization but pronounced differences in apical dendrite arborization between mouse and human, and surprising similarities between human and macaque. Together, these datasets provide a unified multimodal reference that advances our understanding of human cortical circuitry and establishes a foundation for experimental and computational studies of human brain function and disease.",
