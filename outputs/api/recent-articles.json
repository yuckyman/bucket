      "title": "The cortical contribution to the speech-FFR is not modulated by visual information",
      "content": "Seeing a speaker's face can significantly aid understanding, particularly in challenging acoustic environments. An early neural response implicated in audiovisual speech processing is the frequency-following response (speech-FFR), which occurs at the fundamental frequency of the speech signal. This response arises from both subcortical areas and the auditory cortex. Previous studies have shown that subcortical responses are reduced when bimodal stimulation includes visual input from the talker's face. Here, we examined the cortical contribution to the speech-FFR and its potential modulation by visual information. We recorded MEG responses to four types of audiovisual signals: a still image, an artificially generated avatar, a degraded video, and a natural video. The audio stimuli were presented in a substantial level of background noise to make behavioral audiovisual effects stand out. Speech-in-noise comprehension increased significantly from the audio-only condition to the avatar and the degraded video, and further to the natural video. Moreover, we found that all types of audiovisual stimuli yielded robust speech-FFRs in the auditory cortex at an early latency of around 30ms. However, the magnitude of this neural response was neither enhanced nor attenuated by the videos, nor could the cortical contribution of the speech-FFR explain a significant portion of the variance in the behavioral comprehension scores. Our results suggest that visual modulation of the speech-FFR in the auditory cortex is, if existent, too small to be measurable in scenarios where speech occurs in considerable background noise.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "content": "IntroductionMaternal and child undernutrition are linked to atypical brain development in children. Provision of pre- and post-natal small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) has been shown to positively impact children\u2019s growth and development. It is unknown, however, whether SQ-LNS affects child brain morphology.MethodsThe present study used data from the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements randomized controlled trial in Ghana. Participants were 231 children (Mage = 10.6 years; 49.4% female) exposed to maternal iron and folic acid supplements prenatally (n = 113, control group) or maternal SQ-LNS prenatally until 6 mo postpartum and child SQ-LNS from age 6 to 18 months (n = 118, SQ-LNS group). Children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain anatomy. Primary outcomes were total gray matter volume, cortical gray matter thickness, and cortical gray matter volume assessed with whole-brain analyses. Secondary outcomes were thickness and volume of a priori specified cortical and subcortical regions assessed with region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Basic and full covariate models were tested and corrected for multiple comparisons.ResultsWhole-brain analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in total gray matter volume or cortical gray matter thickness or volume. Cortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) thickness [mean (95%CI): 2.78 (2.73, 2.84) vs. 2.72 (2.67, 2.77); effect size = 0.21] and reduced left rostral ACC volume [2575.1 (2477.3, 2672.8) vs. 2678.74 (2568.7, 2788.8); effect size = 0.18]. Subcortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater volume of the left pallidus [1794.45 (1759.10, 1829.80) vs. 1726.13 (1685.05, 1767.21); effect size = 0.33] and right nucleus accumbens [751.54 (729.83, 773.24) vs. 705.73 (684.21, 727.24); effect size = 0.39]. Significant group differences did not hold after correction for multiple comparisons.DiscussionIn this cohort, pre- and post-natal SQ-LNS supplementation did not significantly alter total or cortical gray matter thickness and volume at 10 years, though secondary ROI analyses indicated subtle, non-robust differences in selected regions.",

      "title": "Ca2+-mediated protein citrullination regulates proliferation in the regenerating and malignant CNS",
      "content": "Unlike most adult mammals, regenerative vertebrates can awaken dormant neural stem cells in response to injury. Understanding how this process is regulated could guide strategies to activate stem cells for tissue repair and limit aberrant proliferation in cancers of the CNS. Here, using zebrafish injury models and high-speed live imaging, we identify hydrodynamically-activated Ca2+; signalling as a key driver of neural stem cell activation. Local injury-associated changes in CSF flow activate mechanoreceptors at the site of spinal cord lesions, triggering pulsatile Ca2+ activity and progenitor proliferation. We identify Ca2+-regulated peptidylarginine deiminase enzymes (PADs) as key downstream effectors that citrullinate intracellular targets in a Ca2+-dependent manner to drive progenitor activation. Finally, we show that PAD inhibitors suppress the growth of aggressive medulloblastoma cells in preclinical laboratory models. Together, these findings uncover a novel mechanism of proliferation control in the vertebrate CNS and highlight the value of regenerative studies for identifying therapeutic targets.",

      "title": "Precision in Motion: Reactive and Anticipatory Control of Mouse Tongue Movement for Interception",
      "content": "The ability to perform high precision motor actions to intercept moving objects is fundamental to animal motor behavior, whereby organisms must constantly adapt to a dynamic environment. Such interception tasks rely on tightly integrating predictive internal models and moment-to-moment sensory feedback, a hallmark of complex sensorimotor transformations. Studying interception behavior thus offers a unique window into how the brain flexibly coordinates perception and action in real time. However, traditional behavioral paradigms to study sensorimotor control in head fixed mice, often rooted in classical conditioning, simplify these complex processes into predictable, rigid stimulus response routines. Consequently, these paradigms fail to capture key ethological features of interception, such as the continuous dynamic nature of sensory input and direct physical interaction with moving objects. Our task bridges this gap by integrating naturalistic elements of interceptive behavior with precise experimental control. We introduce a behavioral task in which head fixed mice use their tongue to intercept a food pellet moving at constant speeds, randomly changing from trial to trial. We describe details of the 3D kinematics of discrete tongue reaching movements, their distinctive motor phases, and their learning dependent changes in onset and kinematics. We show that mice adjust their tongue kinematics and movement onset relative to varying pellet speeds, using distinctive reactive and anticipatory strategies. We demonstrate that the anticipatory strategy depends partially on vision and on intact lateral cerebellar circuits. Our novel behavioral paradigm is a valuable tool for exploring the neural basis of sensory motor transformation during object interception in head-fixed mice.",

      "title": "Data-Driven Retrieval of Effective Point Spread Functions for Super-Resolution Optoacoustic Imaging",
      "content": "Localization-based super-resolution techniques have revolutionized biomedical imaging by surpassing classical diffraction limits. However, their performance is fundamentally constrained by distortions of the point spread function (PSF) induced by the system and the sample, which are particularly prominent in the case of spatially under-sampling. Here we introduce a data-driven effective point spread function retrieval (DEPR) method that directly learns continuous, field-dependent system responses from experimental point source datasets. Through statistical aggregation of thousands of targets and iterative self-supervised refinement, DEPR captures spatially variant imaging characteristics in situ without prior assumptions or external calibrations.When integrated into the localization optoacoustic tomography (LOT) pipeline, DEPR achieves accurate sub-pixel localization despite under-sampled conditions, thus enhancing resolution while reducing computational burden. We demonstrate its efficacy by in vivo imaging of the murine brain microvasculature using microparticle contrast agents in the first (NIR-I) and second (NIR-II) near-infrared windows, achieving significant improvement in data utilization efficiency and substantial reduction of gridded artifacts compared to conventional approaches. The method resolves vascular structures with ~41 m separation across a ~3 mm imaging depth range. This framework addresses fundamental challenges shared across diverse localization-based imaging modalities, offering a robust and generalizable strategy for high-precision imaging in complex biological systems.",

      "title": "A brain dynamic model based on graph neural network reflect the inter-region interaction of cortical areas",
      "content": "A central objective in neuroscience is to elucidate how the brain generates complex dynamic activity through the interactions of brain areas. In this study, we utilized Interaction Network, a graph neural network model, to develop a computational framework for predicting whole-brain cortical blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals. We derived an Inter-Regional Interaction (IRI) metric to quantify information exchange among brain areas probing the underlying dynamical mechanisms. In addition, the total IRI emitted from each brain region was calculated and defined as the IRI sent by region (RS-IRI). Our model predicted the following 10 time points BOLD activity from initial BOLD signals, and achieved a mean absolute error of 0.04. The predicted functional connectivity (FC) achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.97 compared to the empirical FC. The fluctuation amplitude of the IRI increases with the length of the connection and the largest RS-IRI oscillation amplitude is observed in visual areas. The RS-IRI demonstrates a hierarchical organization, characterized by more concentrated distributions in association regions and larger fluctuation amplitudes in unimodal regions. Applying our approach to Alzheimers disease (AD), we demonstrate that the frequency-specific amplitudes of IRI oscillations discriminate AD patients from healthy controls and correlate with Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Together, this work presents a deep learning-based framework for modeling brain dynamics as well a quantitative index of inter-areal interactions, and offers a new perspective for disease characterization.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",
