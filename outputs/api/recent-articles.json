      "title": "A 'brain-first' mouse model of progressive alpha-synuclein pathology via intranasal rotenone administration",
      "content": "The precise aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still poorly understood, but it is thought to arise due to an intricate relationship between genes and the environment. Our study takes a unique approach to understanding the effect of environmental factors on the onset and progression of -synuclein (aSyn) pathology, a key feature of PD, from the olfactory bulb (OB) to other brain regions. In the present study, we evaluated the time-dependent progression of PD-like pathology by administering rotenone intranasally for 5.5 months in C57BL/6 male mice. We performed olfactory and motor tests and examined the aSyn accumulation, glial cell activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration after 3, 4 and 5.5 months of rotenone exposure by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence techniques. We observed a time-dependent progression of aSyn accumulation from the OB to other brain regions, including the mid-brain and cortex. Consistently, we observed a time-dependent behavioural impairment, OB atrophy, progression of aSyn pathology, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Our findings also established a link between distinct astrocyte activation and dopaminergic (DAergic) activity. In conclusion, this chronic and progressive mouse model mimics the brain-first type of progression of PD-like pathology in some PD patients, opening the possibility for testing potential disease-modifying interventions.",

      "title": "CRISP: a correlation-filtered recursive feature elimination and integration of SMOTE pipeline for gait-based Parkinson\u2019s disease screening",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disorder, with subtle gait changes such as reduced vertical ground-reaction forces (VGRF) often preceding motor symptoms. These gait abnormalities, measurable via wearable VGRF sensors, offer a non-invasive means for early PD detection. However, current computational approaches often suffer from redundant features and class imbalance, limiting both accuracy and generalizability.MethodsWe propose CRISP (Correlation-filtered Recursive Feature Elimination and Integration of SMOTE Pipeline for Gait-Based Parkinson\u2019s Disease Screening), a lightweight multistage framework that sequentially applies correlation-based feature pruning, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) based class balancing. To ensure clinically meaningful evaluation, a novel subject-wise protocol was also introduced that assigns one prediction per individual enhancing patient-level variability capture and better aligning with diagnostic workflows. Using 306 VGRF recordings (93 PD, 76 controls), five classifiers, i.e., \ufeffk-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Gradient boosting (GB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were evaluated for both binary PD detection and multiclass severity grading.ResultsCRISP consistently improved performance across all models under 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost achieved the highest performance, increasing subject-wise PD detection accuracy from 96.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8% to 98.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8%, and severity grading accuracy from 96.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7% to 99.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5%.ConclusionCRISP is the first VGRF-based pipeline to combine correlation-filtered feature pruning, recursive feature elimination, and SMOTE to enhance PD detection performance, while also introducing a subject-wise evaluation protocol that captures patient-level variability for truly personalized diagnostics. These twin novelties deliver clinically significant gains and lay the foundation for real-time, on-device PD detection and severity monitoring.",

      "title": "Efficacy of snap-needle patch therapy in pediatric epilepsy: a case study",
      "content": "BackgroundsEpilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder in early childhood, often characterized by genetic predisposition and diverse clinical manifestations. Benign epilepsy of childhood with central temporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common form of self-limited focal epilepsy (SeLFE) syndrome in children, accounting for approximately 6%\u20137% of all childhood epilepsy cases (Wirrell et al., 2011; Camfield et al., 1996). We report a case of a child who was treated with additional snap-needle for 3 months on top of poorly controlled oral medication alone, who stopped having seizures and gradually reduced the dose of oral medication and finally stopped, and was followed up for 1 year after stopping the medication without any recurrence.Case summaryA 10-years-old male had his first generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) at age 7 during nocturnal sleep. Following this event, the parents sought medical evaluation, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal wave patterns. Over the following 3 years, the child had 2\u20133 GTCS annually; despite multiple adjustments to antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, GTCS frequency indicated disease progression. However, after starting snap-needle patch therapy [guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles], the child remained seizure-free. Continuous monitoring has been conducted to date. We present this case of a pediatric patient with epilepsy: oral medication failed to control GTCS, but snap-needle patch therapy achieved successful seizure management, after which oral medication was discontinued.ConclusionAfter a systematic literature search, this study represents the first case report of BECTS treated with snap-needle therapy (needle size: 0.220 mm \u00d7 1.5 mm). In this case, the child\u2019s GTCSs resolved following the addition of snap-needle therapy, and oral antiepileptic medication was gradually reduced to complete discontinuation; no seizure recurrence was observed within 1 year of follow-up. It is important to acknowledge that the contributions of medication adjustments and the self-limiting nature of BECTS cannot be ruled out in this case. However, based on the observations here, we propose the hypothesis that snap-needle intervention is likely associated with seizure remission. Although the mechanism underlying snap-needle therapy for BECTS remains unclear, the child achieved a QOLCE-16-C score of 98.4 at the end of treatment; during the 1-year follow-up, the number of nighttime sleep disruptions also decreased from 2 to 5 episodes per year to 0. These outcomes surpass those typically achievable through pharmacological intervention alone.",

      "title": "The articulatory basis of phonological error patterns in childhood speech sound disorders",
      "content": "Speech acquisition involves complex coordination of articulatory structures, primarily the jaw, lips, and tongue. Typically developing children acquire speech sounds in a hierarchical sequence governed by progressive neuromotor maturation. However, disruptions in speech motor control can lead to systematic phonological error patterns, commonly attributed to cognitive-linguistic deficits. This study explores the articulatory foundations of phonological error patterns in preschool-aged children diagnosed with moderate-to-severe speech sound disorders. Using data from 48 children who participated in a randomized controlled trial, we employed Mutual Information Analysis and Random Forest Models to quantify associations between specific speech motor limitations and phonological error patterns identified via the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology assessment. Results showed moderate associations between phonological error patterns in particular cluster reduction, final consonant deletion, stopping, gliding, and atypical errors and limitations in jaw, labial-facial, and lingual control. Gliding, unexpectedly, demonstrated a negative relationship with speech motor errors, being more prevalent among older and milder cases, suggesting it may reflect a compensatory developmental stage rather than purely phonological simplification. These findings highlight the significance of speech motor constraints in phonological error patterns, challenging traditional cognitive-linguistic explanations. The results support theoretical frameworks such as Articulatory Phonology, emphasizing that phonological error patterns are influenced substantially by articulatory and neuromotor development. This study underscores the need for integrating motor considerations into clinical assessments and interventions for speech sound disorders in children, fostering a comprehensive approach bridging cognitive-linguistic and motor speech perspectives.",

      "title": "Modeling dyslexia in neurotypical adults by combining neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques: a hypothesis paper",
      "content": "Dyslexia is a prevalent developmental disorder marked by deficits in literacy skills. Given that the core deficits of dyslexia are uniquely human, animal models have not been as useful in dyslexia research as they have been in other areas of research. While significant progress has been made through behavioral and neuroimaging studies, a viable model could facilitate controlled investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia and accelerate the development of targeted interventions. In this hypothesis article, we propose a two-pronged approach to model dyslexia in neurotypical adults using neuroimaging and neuromodulation techniques. First, we propose using functional and structural MRI data to cluster individuals into neuropathologically derived subgroups in order to facilitate the classification of dyslexia subtypes based on neuropathological characteristics. Second, we propose employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) to temporarily downregulate activity in brain regions specified in the clustering analysis, inducing subtype-specific dyslexic symptoms in neurotypical individuals. This approach enables the establishment of causal or probabilistic relationships between neuropathologies and dyslexia subtypes, while at the same time creating dyslexia models to facilitate investigation into subtype-specific interventions. Although this model is somewhat limited by the transient nature of neuromodulation as well as by the use of healthy adults to model a developmental disorder whose symptoms first arise in childhood, it is a meaningful step towards refining our understanding of the neural basis of dyslexia subtypes and it opens the door to novel and effective therapies. By integrating neuroimaging and neuromodulation, we hope to offer a viable substitute for animal models in dyslexia and accelerate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies for dyslexia.",

      "title": "Toward accurate single image sand dust removal by utilizing uncertainty-aware neural network",
      "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

      "title": "EEG synchronization signatures for decoding attentional states during continuous force control",
      "content": "IntroductionMind wandering, the shift of attention from an ongoing task to task-unrelated thoughts, is a pervasive cognitive phenomenon often accompanied by detrimental consequences for task performance. While extensively studied in visual and auditory paradigms, attentional fluctuations during visuo-haptic tasks, such as force control, remain underexplored despite their high relevance to real-world skilled activities such as surgical operations or robotic-assisted manipulation. There exists a critical deficiency in exploring signatures of mind wandering from the perspective of neural synchronization.MethodsThis study investigated EEG-based synchronization features to decode attentional states during a novel continuous force control task using the thought-probe method. Nine healthy male participants tracked a dynamically varying target force while scalp EEG and high-frequency force data were recorded synchronously. EEG epochs preceding self-reported attentional probes were labeled as on-task or mind-wandering states. Spectral power and three synchronization features \u2013 cross-frequency coupling, functional connectivity, and neural-behavioral synchronization \u2013 were extracted and compared between on-task and mind-wandering states.Results and discussionResults revealed that the mind-wandering state was characterized by increased alpha power (8-10 Hz) over frontal-posterior regions and reduced occurrence of high alpha-theta harmonic ratios. It also exhibited increased functional connectivity within sensorimotor networks and decreased mutual information between frontal EEG activity and force errors. Support vector machine classifiers for the binary attentional-state classification, utilizing combined spectral power and synchronization features, achieved 75.53% within-participant and 71.57% cross-participant accuracy, outperforming single-feature models. These findings highlight EEG synchronization signatures of mind wandering and demonstrate their feasibility for decoding attentional states during the force control task. This work may provide a foundation for future exploration of haptic-based neurofeedback systems, which could potentially complement existing visual and auditory modalities in applications such as neurocognitive rehabilitation or skilled motor training.",

      "content": "The small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SK3, encoded by the KCNN3 gene, plays a critical role in regulating dopaminergic neuron (DN) firing patterns by modulating after hyperpolarization currents. SK3 dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. We analyzed structural and functional consequences of KCNN3 splicing and genetic variation. Alternative splicing variants of the KCNN3 gene were retrieved from the Ensembl database and aligned using T-Coffee, manually inspected and curated. Protein domains were identified with Pfam 35.0, SMART 9.0, and InterPro 98.0, and visualized. An AlphaFold2 model of SK3 full-length protein (UniProt: Q9UGI6) used as reference and structural models of its splicing variants were predicted with ColabFold. Functional domains (S1\u2013S6 transmembrane helices, H5 pore loop, and calmodulin-binding) were defined and superimposed onto the AlphaFold2 reference. Domain integrity was assessed based on completeness of all expected residue indices within each functional region. SNPs and CNVs across all coding KCNN3 splicing variants were analyzed, classified, and filtered to isolate pathogenic variants prioritizing non-synonymous amino acid substitutions. Differential variant impacts across splicing isoforms were assessed by mapping variant positions to individual transcript protein sequences and used to predict functional consequences. Two long and two short splicing variants are known. Short variants lack the motif required for potassium channels. Pathogenic variants result from missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions. In all cases, the consequential effects depend on the specific location and role of the amino acid being changed.",

      "content": "Spatial group independent component analysis (sgr-ICA) is widely used in resting-state fMRI to identify intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). While lower-order decompositions reveal large-scale networks, higher-order models provide finer granularity but have been limited by small sample sizes. In this study, we applied sgr-ICA with 500 components to more than 100,000 subjects with rsfMRI to generate a robust fine-grained ICN template. Using this template, we examined whole brain functional network connectivity (FNC) in 502 individuals with schizophrenia and 640 typical controls and compared the findings with a lower order multiscale template. The 500-component template yielded a large set of reliable ICNs, particularly in the cerebellar and paralimbic regions, and revealed schizophrenia-related dysconnectivity patterns that were not detected at larger spatial scales. Specifically, we observed hypoconnectivity between the cerebellar and subcortical domains (basal ganglia and thalamus) and hyperconnectivity between the cerebellar domain and the visual, sensorimotor and higher cognitive domains. These results demonstrate that very high-order ICA can capture distinct fine-grained ICNs, improving the detection of disease-related connectivity differences and enriching current multiscale ICN templates. The derived ICNs can serve as a valuable reference for future studies and potentially enhance the clinical utility of rsfMRI in psychiatric research.",

      "content": "Objective. To address the limited innate regenerative capacity of neural tissues following traumatic brain injury (TBI) by developing a novel therapeutic intervention. Approach. We engineered a composite scaffold using 3D bioprinting to integrate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with collagen-heparan matrices supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), creating a 3D-CH-bFGF/NGF-MSCs construct. Main results. The engineered construct demonstrated favorable biomechanical characteristics and cytocompatibility. In rat TBI models, this intervention significantly enhanced cognitive recovery and sustained sensorimotor function restoration. Histopathological analyses revealed corresponding neural network regeneration through axonal regrowth, synaptogenesis reinforcement, and myelination enhancement at injury sites. Significance. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of a 3D-bioprinted, growth factor-enhanced MSC-scaffold construct to promote structural and functional neural repair after TBI, offering a promising strategy for neural tissue regeneration.",

      "content": "Objective. Steady-state visually evoked potential-based Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach. Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results. Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 and 145.02\u2009bits\u2009min\u22121 on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/osmanberke/SFDA-SSVEP-BCI. Significance. The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.",
