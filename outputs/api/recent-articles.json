      "title": "Differential Effects of 5-HT7 Receptor Signaling in the Noradrenergic System in a Rat Model of Treatment-Resistant Depression",
      "content": "Introduction: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major clinical challenge, and its neurobiological basis remains unclear. The locus coeruleus (LC), a key noradrenergic hub, shows altered activity in TRD models, and serotonergic 5-HT7 receptors have emerged as potential modulators of this circuit. Methods: We assessed the impact of 5-HT7 receptor activation on LC function in Wistar Kyoto rats, an established TRD model, using in vivo extracellular recordings, in vitro patch-clamp assays, and receptor expression analysis. Results: Systemic administration of AS19, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, increased LC neuronal firing in both strains, with a significantly greater effect in Wistar Kyoto rats. This response was prevented by a 5-HT7 antagonist confirming receptor specificity. Glutamatergic blockade altered AS19 effects in a strain-dependent manner, whereas in vitro assays revealed no differential postsynaptic modulation and similar presynaptic inhibition across groups. Western blot analysis showed elevated 5-HT7 receptor expression in the LC, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala of Wistar Kyoto rats, alongside reduced expression in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: These findings indicate that 5-HT7 receptor activation exerts complex, circuit-dependent modulation of LC activity, influenced by glutamatergic and serotonergic inputs. Enhanced receptor expression in limbic regions and altered LC responsiveness may contribute to TRD pathophysiology and highlight 5-HT7 signaling as a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Humanized Kcnv2 E151X Mouse Captures Hallmarks of KCNV2-Associated Retinal Dystrophy",
      "content": "Background: KCNV2-associated retinopathy is a rare inherited retinal dystrophy caused by variants in the KCNV2 gene, leading to disrupted photoreceptor function and slowly progressive vision loss. Patients have characteristic electroretinography abnormalities, including reduced cone responses, delayed and reduced rod responses to low light flashes and paradoxically large rod-driven responses to bright flashes of light. To model this condition, we generated the Kcnv2 E151X mouse line and assessed its structural and functional retinal features. Methods: We have employed CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing technology to generate a mouse line with an early stop mutation in position E151 - orthologous to the commonly encountered E143X mutation in humans - and performed a combination of immunohistochemistry and Western Blot to confirm the absence of the full-length KCNV2-encoded protein, Kv8.2. To assess how closely it models the human disease, we have characterised the KCNV2 mutant mouse line at histological and functional levels employing immunohistochemistry and electroretinography, respectively. Results: Kcnv2 mutant mice showed markedly reduced photopic responses and reproduced the supernormal rod phenotype as described in affected individuals. In the morphological context, mutant retinas demonstrated strong and early glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation together with reduced counts of cone arrestin positive cells as well as photoreceptors in general. Conclusions: The Kcnv2 mutant mouse line replicates key functional and structural hallmarks of KCNV2-associated retinopathy. This model provides a relevant platform for mechanistic studies and preclinical evaluation of gene based or pharmacological therapies targeting cone and rod photoreceptor dysfunction.",

      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"\">A few years ago, we developed a universal metric of data quality for averaged ERPs called the standardized measurement error (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2020/4/28/data-quality\">click here</a> for more information). It has been available in ERPLAB for several years, and I\u2019m happy to announce that it is now available in BrainVision Analyzer 2.3.1 and in MNE-Python.</p><p class=\"\">For BrainVision Analyzer, it is available as a Solution.
