      "title": "Decoding the ''bouba-kiki'' effect in early visual cortex",
      "content": "The ''bouba-kiki'' effect, or sound symbolism, is the non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and visual shapes, in which words like ''bouba'' are consistently associated with round shapes, and ''kiki'' with spiky shapes. Despite robust behavioral evidence for sound symbolic associations, it is still unclear whether they are a linguistic epiphenomenon or manifest themselves as distinct sensory representations in the human brain. Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analyses, we show that, in the absence of visual input, round and spiky sound symbolic words elicit distinct neural representations, not only in auditory and speech processing regions, but also in parietal and even early visual cortex including V1. These neural representations correlate with behavioural shape judgements of sound-symbolic words, as revealed by representational similarity analyses. Our findings suggest a potential functional mechanism for sound symbolism: phonological features of sound symbolic words are represented in auditory and speech processing regions and linked to cross-modal shape representations in parietal and early visual regions, which in turn lead to sound symbolic perceptual judgements. Thus, our results provide evidence for a neural mechanism underlying the ''bouba-kiki'' effect in the human brain.",

      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",
