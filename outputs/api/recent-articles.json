      "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">First, I guess I should've avoided the word \"rhetorical.\" &nbsp;In my post, I characterized Ioannidis's 2005 claim, type M and S errors, and multiverse analysis as \"rhetorical tools\" that have been been useful in the field of science criticism but which I would not use in my own analyses. &nbsp;I could've added to this many other statistical methods including p-values and Bayes factors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, a few things in your post that I did not address above:</div><div style=\"border: 0px;

Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

      "title": "Hemifield-Specific Motion Extrapolation Reveals Limits of Interhemispheric Integration",
      "content": "The accurate perception of moving objects is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, which must compensate for neural processing delays. Motion extrapolation is a proposed mechanism whereby the brain predicts an object's future position. We investigated how an object's motion history shapes its perceived position using the flash-jump illusion, in which a brief color change in a moving bar is mislocalized as further along the direction of motion. Across two experiments, we found that longer preceding motion sequences improved localization accuracy, consistent with motion adaptation. This effect occurred regardless of whether motion continued after the flash. Notably, mislocalization transiently reappeared as the object crossed the vertical midline, suggesting that motion adaptation and motion extrapolation operate independently between within each hemifield. Manipulating the length of the sequence in each hemifield in Experiment 2 confirmed that this adaptation is spatially confined to each hemifield, with limited interhemispheric transfer. The results align with a Bayesian framework in which the brain integrates signals from both hemispheres, with midline crossings triggering a shift from adapted to unadapted neural populations. We identify motion extrapolation, supported by hemifield-specific adaptation in area MT and integration in area MST, as the mechanism behind these midline discontinuities. This work reframes smooth pursuit not just as a tracking behaviour, but as a functional solution to overcome the inherent limits of interhemispheric motion processing.",

      "title": "A regulatory loop regulating signaling between LRRK2 and PP2A in cellular models of Parkinsons disease",
      "content": "Mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of late-onset familial and idiopathic Parkinsons disease (PD), known to date. Importantly, recent data from post-mortem tissue as well as biomarker studies suggest that independent of mutations, increased kinase activity of LRRK2 plays an essential role in idiopathic PD pathogenesis. Despite extensive research on LRRK2, its activation mechanism(s) and how the various mutations result in increased kinase activity and neuronal death is still not completely understood. Accumulating evidence points to LRRK2 phospho-regulation, both auto-phosphorylation and phosphorylation by other kinases, as one potential molecular trigger of its activation. LRRK2 activation and localization is regulated by phosphatases such as Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), however the exact mechanism of this phospho-regulation is not known. Our data reveal that PP2A dephosphorylates sites within the RocCOR-GTPase domain of LRRK2 and as a result de-stabilizes LRRK2 dimers, with consequent reduction of its kinase activity. Strikingly, our data further highlight that LRRK2 in turn phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme PPP2CA at its critical residue T304, crucial for both holoenzyme formation and catalytic activity. Importantly, expression of WT-PPP2CA protects from LRRK2-G2019S induced neuronal cell death, while PPP2CA-T304 mutants fail to do so, suggesting that impaired PP2A holoenzyme formation might be detrimental for LRRK2-PD.",

      "content": "Modifying behavior in response to changing environmental conditions is a crucial adaptive function. This capacity is exemplified when animals curtail pursuit of a valued outcome that risks being punished by aversive consequences, but the mediating brain mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, using in vivo cellular-resolution calcium (Ca2+) imaging, optogenetics and chemogenetics, we show that risk of punishment dramatically alters choice between a large/risky and small/safe reward and produces novel, causally necessary, patterns of activity in basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons. We find that experience of a punished outcome generates a BLA representation that is selectively replayed when animals subsequently abort choice of the large/risky reward option. Additionally, we show that risk leads to the incorporation of newly encoding BLA neurons into the pre-choice representation, which predicts shifting away from the large/risky option. These findings reveal how dynamic reshaping of BLA representations underpins behavioral flexibility in the face of risk.",

We tested this idea using intracranial EEG in patients performing a verbal fluency task, where they spontaneously explored their own knowledge of the world, sampling words from semantic memory. We found that hippocampal theta power increased during conceptual search and scaled with the semantic distance between successive words, paralleling dynamics observed in spatial navigation. Critically, people transitioned between conceptual clusters, resembling transitions between resource patches in foraging behavior. These shifts were marked by enhanced theta-gamma coupling, both within the hippocampus and between the hippocampus and lateral temporal cortex, a key hub of the semantic network. These findings support a mechanistic account of memory search grounded in navigation and foraging principles, suggesting that the hippocampus orchestrates local computations and long-range interactions to enable flexible retrieval of conceptual knowledge.",

      "title": "Neuropathic pain drives time-dependent reorganization of corticostriatal circuits",
      "content": "Chronic pain fundamentally alters sensorimotor integration and motivated behaviors, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this transition remain poorly understood. The striatum, composed of dopamine receptor type 1 (D1)- and type 2 (D2)- expressing spiny projection neurons (SPN), integrates cortical sensory and motor inputs to coordinate movement and motivation, making it a critical candidate for mediating pain-induced behavioral adaptations. Although spinal and cortical pain circuits are well-characterized in limited phases of pain, how corticostriatal pathways and distinct striatal cell populations contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain states remains unclear. Here we show that neuropathic pain, after spared nerve injury in mice, produces temporally distinct, cell-type-specific changes in striatal SPN activity and corticostriatal plasticity that evolve across acute to chronic pain phases. D1 SPNs exhibit smaller amplitude and slower calcium signals during acute pain stages that persist through early chronic phases, while D2 SPNs show delayed response timing during later chronic stages, but also stimulus-specific alterations in neural activity throughout acute and chronic pain states. Critically, primary somatosensory cortex inputs to D2 SPNs develop depressing synapses specifically during intermediate chronic pain phases (~25 days post-injury) that disappear during more severe chronic stages (>3 months), suggesting a failed compensatory mechanism. These findings reveal that striatal circuits undergo dynamic, time-dependent reorganization after peripheral injury, with D1 and D2 pathways contributing distinct temporal signatures to pain-related behavior. The identification of critical windows of striatal plasticity provides new targets for therapeutic interventions that could prevent or reverse chronic pain states by modulating specific corticostriatal circuits during vulnerable transition periods.",

Efficient locomotion is especially important in small organisms where the motile phase is ontogenetically restricted. Motile larvae of otherwise sessile cnidarians must disperse and identify a suitable habitat in a restricted timeframe. Here we show that dispersal in Nematostella vectensis larvae is accomplished by a constant ciliary sensory-motor system that produces stimulus-induced movement. In contrast, neuro-muscular and sensory systems gradually increase in complexity during development, enabling movement-associated gait control through reafferent matching of external and internal information. Together with ciliary propulsion, the developmentally timed appearance of sensory and neuronal structures endows the animal with the ability to integrate information to shape swimming behavior and achieve dispersal in a timely manner, appropriate to the physical challenges of its specific ecological niche.",

      "content": "Absence epilepsy is marked by sudden lapses in consciousness accompanied by spike-wave discharges (SWDs), yet the neural mechanisms underlying impaired sensorimotor processing in these episodes remain unresolved. Prior work has shown that normal-appearing signals can persist in primary sensory cortical areas during seizures, suggesting that impaired behavioral responsiveness may arise from disruptions in higher-order association cortex. To investigate this hypothesis, we combined behavioral testing with simultaneous local field potential recordings in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). Rats were trained in an auditory conditioned response task, allowing comparison of tone-evoked responses during interictal baseline and ictal SWDs. We found that behavioral performance collapsed during SWDs, with correct responses falling from ~88% at baseline to <1% during SWDs (p < 0.001). Nevertheless, auditory event-related potentials in primary auditory cortex (Au1) during SWDs were not significantly decreased. In contrast, we identified a novel oscillatory evoked potential in the anterior insular cortex (AIC) that was robust in controls, attenuated in GAERS at baseline, and markedly reduced during SWDs. Notably, reductions in AIC response magnitude also occurred during satiated, unmotivated states, but waveform structure was preserved, distinguishing motivational modulation from seizure-related disruption. These results demonstrate that absence seizures selectively impair signals in the anterior insula rather than in primary auditory cortex, identifying the AIC as a potentially critical hub for gating auditory conscious awareness. Beyond refining models of seizure-related unconsciousness, the discovery of an insular oscillatory potential highlights a candidate biomarker and intervention target for absence epilepsy, with broader implications for understanding impaired consciousness in anesthesia, sleep, and brain injury.",

      "title": "Computational characterization of decision making during trans-saccadic visual perception",
      "content": "When sampling visual information from the environment, humans execute fast sequential saccadic eye movements and yet preserve stability in their visual percept. This ability relies on the continuous integration of external sensory information (e.g., visual displacements) and internal monitoring signals. At the time of the saccade subjects often experience saccadic suppression of displacement--a failure to notice changes in the location of visual objects slightly shifted during the eye movement. Although well studied, questions remain regarding how and when external sensory signals lead to perceptual judgment alterations following saccadic eye movements. Here we used a drift diffusion modeling (DDM) framework to systematically examine the extent to which sensory information biased perceptual judgments when detecting trans-saccadic shifts of visual targets. Healthy human participants (N = 30, 21 female) completed a visual perception task in which a visual target was shifted following a prompted saccadic eye movement (4o or 8o). Target displacements occurred up to +2.5o along the horizontal axis, and participants reported the shift direction with a button press response. Incorporating the perceptual response and visual error between the displaced target and end-movement fixation location, the DDM accounted for the visuospatial biasing effects of sensory processing on decision-making. The modeling framework based on the visual error could also capture individual positive and negative biasing effects across backward shifts (i.e., towards the initial fixation location) and forward shifts (i.e., further away from initial fixation). Furthermore, participants whose perceptual bias was more pronounced in either the backward or forward directions tended to show a greater visuospatial offset in evidence accumulation preceding perceptual judgments due to an overreliance on the visual error information. The DDM computational modeling approach described here shows promise as an explanatory framework to account for sensorimotor integration impairments based on perceptual deficits demonstrated in certain patient populations.",

      "title": "Mu suppression reveals auditory-motor predictions after short motor training in non-musicians",
      "content": "Auditory-motor coupling is a bidirectional neural mechanism that supports speech and music, as demonstrated by motor system activation during passive listening to learned melodies. Such activation is predictive, occurs in non-musicians after a single motor training session, and can be elicited at the single-note level of the practiced melody. These findings support the idea that motor activity guides auditory perception by relaying predictive timing information. However, the evidence remains incomplete, as the neural processes underlying this anticipatory motor activity are not fully understood. EEG studies in musicians have linked it to mu-band suppression, but the temporal scale at which suppression occurs has not been established, and its generalizability to the broader population remains unclear. To address these gaps, we recruited 25 non-musicians who learned to play a simple melody on a piano-like keyboard. Before and after training, participants passively listened to the trained melody and control melodies. Offline, EEG data from the motor training were used to create a time-frequency mask identifying channels, frequencies, and timepoints likely to display mu suppression during passive listening. Significant mu suppression emerged before each note onset only during post-training exposure to the practiced melody, with no effects in other frequency bands. Results prove that mu suppression occurs at the single-note level following short auditory-motor training and is not dependent on prior musical training. Thus, mu suppression appears tied to the anticipatory motor activity observed in prior studies, supporting the notion that motor activity aids perception by anticipating the unfolding of learned auditory-motor sequences.",

      "content": "The most common genetic cause of both familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an expanded G4C2 repeat in the first intron of the gene C9orf72. The C9orf72 repeat expansion is bidirectionally transcribed into sense and anti-sense RNA foci, and also produces dipeptide repeats (DPRs) via a non-canonical translation mechanism known as repeat-associated (RAN) translation. Each of these components of the G4C2 repeat expansion cause neurodegenerative effects in animal models when expressed in neurons, but impacts from glial expression are more poorly understood. Here, we use glial cell type-specific expression of individual DPRs, of RNA repeat-only, or of the G4C2 repeat that is capable of producing both DPRs and RNA repeats to systematically investigate both the glial cell-intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity of each of these components. Our results show that as with neurons, the GR and G4C2 transgenes, produce the highest degree of cell-intrinsic toxicity when expressed in glia. Both of these transgenes are capable of producing the GR DPR, which is also typically found to be the most toxic factor in neurons. We demonstrate that both the GR and G4C2 transgenes cause activation of mdg4, an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). Such ERV expression is a hallmark of TDP-43 dysfunction that is commonly observed in C9orf72 patients and contributes to both cell intrinsic and non-cell autonomous toxicity. We find that only the G4C2 transgene produces measurable non-cell autonomous effects that result in loss of nearby neurons. But manipulations of apoptosis reveal non-cell autonomous or systemic effects from either GR or G4C2 expressing glia. Blocking apoptotic cell death of either GR or G4C2 expressing glia via the p35 caspase inhibitor further exacerbates effects on lifespan and ablating such glia via expression of the proapoptotic reaper gene partially ameliorates these effects.",

      "title": "Disrupted Calcium Dynamics in Reactive Astrocytes Occur with End Feet-Arteriole Decoupling in an Amyloid Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "<p>While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two-photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake 7- to 8-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multicell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte end feet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, end feet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared with WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte end feet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiologic communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p>",

      "title": "mWAKE in the Central Amygdala Regulates Fear Learning and Memory",
      "content": "<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is an important neuronal hub that integrates external sensory inputs and information about internal states to regulate a range of innate and learned behaviors, including fear learning and memory. Prior studies, leveraging robust fear conditioning assays, have delineated detailed circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and recall of fear memories. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in the CeA remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the clock output molecule mWAKE/ANKFN1 within the CeA of male mice in fear learning and memory. mWAKE is expressed in multiple neuronal subclusters in the lateral CeA. Surprisingly, mWAKE levels do not exhibit rhythmic expression in the CeA. In line with this observation, expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL also does not cycle in the CeA. Consistent with prior studies, loss of mWAKE function increases intrinsic excitability of CeA neurons. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of mWAKE and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>mWAKE</sup> neurons impair fear learning and memory. Finally, we show that mWAKE levels in a subset of CeA neurons are reduced following fear conditioning. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism modulating the activity and function of CeA neurons in fear learning and memory.</p>",

      "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",
