      "title": "Plasmalogen-Independent Neuroprotection: Synthetic alkyl ether lipids activate signaling to mitigate neuroinflammation and enhance cognitive function",
      "content": "Neuroinflammation is a key driver of neurodegenerative disorders, with chronic activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway contributing to neuronal dysfunction and disease progression. In this study, we report that KIT-8, a synthetic alkyl ether lipid, exerts potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects despite its inability to be converted into plasmalogens within cells unlike its analog KIT-13, which is known to generate plasmalogens. Remarkably, KIT-8 activates key intracellular signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of ERK and AKT, and enhances brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf') expression in Neuro2A cells, thereby mimicking the actions of both KIT-13 and natural plasmalogens. Furthermore, KIT-8 significantly improves memory function in mice, underscoring its inherent therapeutic potential. Importantly, the biological activity of KIT-8 suggests that plasmalogen synthesis is not required for its functional effects, introducing a novel concept in ether lipid biology. Supporting this notion, we identified additional alkyl ether lipid analogs, KIT-19 and KIT-20, which also demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties despite lacking the ability to generate plasmalogens. These findings indicate that the ether bond structure alone may be sufficient to confer biological activity. To explore this further, we designed and synthesized a series of structurally distinct alkyl ether lipids (KIT compounds) retaining an ether bond at the sn-2 position. In an LPS-induced inflammatory model using mouse-derived microglial MG6 cells, selected compounds KIT-8, KIT-19, and KIT-20 significantly suppressed NF-{kappa}B signaling, reduced p65 nuclear translocation, and downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta} and NOS2. Given the cognitive benefits associated with plasmalogens in Alzheimer's disease, our findings position alkyl ether lipids as promising standalone bioactive molecules, capable of mitigating neuroinflammation and enhancing neuronal function independently of plasmalogen synthesis.",

      "title": "Automated assessment of tDCS electrode placement accuracy based on structural MRI",
      "content": "Purpose: Accurate electrode placement is essential for studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) since it determines whether - and to which extent - the intended brain region was modulated. Precise electrode placement also reduces between-subject variability. Using in-scanner tDCS, accuracy and precision of electrode placement can be determined. Previous studies manually segmented electrode positions from structural MRI, a process that is time-consuming and prone to error. We therefore developed an algorithm that automatedly extracts electrode coordinates from structural MRI. Methods: We applied this algorithm to 49 datasets acquired at different field strengths (3 T and 7 T), with two image resolutions and electrode montages (bifrontal or ring-shaped) targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We validated its accuracy by comparing the automatedly extracted coordinates with manual annotations from two independent readers. We then used the actual and intended electrode coordinates to simulate how electrode placement deviations influenced the resulting electric field. Results: For all setups and scanners, the median localization error of the algorithm was 2.3 mm. It was within 1 mm of the variability between human readers (2.7 mm), indicating human-level reliability. Large deviations (> 20 mm) from intended positions led to substantial changes in the electric field - up to 35% for the ring-shaped montage - highlighting the need for placement verification in tDCS studies. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm obviates the need for manual electrode segmentation and allows an objective evaluation of electrode placement accuracy and precision for in-scanner tDCS. It may be used to relate electrode position errors to stimulation effects, thereby supporting reproducible tDCS research.",

      "title": "The circadian clock regulates scavenging of fluid-borne substrates by brain border-associated macrophages",
      "content": "Circadian disruptions perturb the brain and immune system and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's Disease (AD), yet whether this involves dysregulation of brain immunity remains less clear. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the brain immune compartment around the day-night cycle and identify brain border-associated macrophages (BAMs) as highly rhythmic cells. During the rest phase, we find that BAMs exhibit coordinated upregulation of endocytic genes and enhanced uptake of extracellular fluid-borne material including amyloid-beta. Rhythmicity in BAM scavenging is regulated by the clock gene Bmal1, mediated by the endocytic receptor CD206, and perturbed with age. In a mouse model of AD, we show that deletion of Bmal1 in BAMs worsens perivascular and leptomeningeal amyloid-beta plaque burden. Our results identify endocytosis as a specialized and rhythmic BAM function and identify perturbed timing of brain border immune functions as a potential mechanism by which circadian disruptions precipitate amyloidosis.",

      "title": "Systematic Errors in DC Offset Measurement and Mitigation at Neurostimulation Electrodes: Causes, Implications and Solutions",
      "content": "Objective: Neuromodulation therapies are becoming increasingly common as a therapeutic strategy to treat neurological disorders and deficits. Despite their widespread use, the frameworks used to evaluate device longevity and electrochemical safety are limited, producing variable results for platinum (Pt) electrodes across studies. In addition, next-generation neuromodulation electrodes like thin-film microelectrode arrays (TFMEAs) are more prone to failure by virtue of their smaller size, higher edge to bulk ratios, and greater sensitivity to electrochemical dissolution processes. Two potential contributors to the variability in reported electrochemical safety limits and device performance are particularly sensitive to scaling electrodes to smaller geometries, namely: 1) insufficient measurement device input impedance and 2) unmitigated stimulator leakage currents. Approach: To explore these effects, we first characterize the impact of electrode size (1.27 x 10-4 to 7.85 x 10-3 cm2) on apparent open circuit potential (VaOCP) and interpulse potential (VIPP) measurements at platinum electrodes across measurement instrumentation configurations. Next, we evaluated the effectiveness of commonly used DC mitigation strategies, including stimulation with capacitive coupling (CC), and with capacitive coupling combined with cathode/anode shorting after each pulse (CC+ES), as a function of electrode size. Main Results: Without proper DC mitigation, insufficient measurement input impedance leads to an underestimation of DC offsets ({Delta}VIPP) and, consequently, overestimation of charge injection limit (Qinj) at Pt electrodes. In contrast, when DC offsets are properly mitigated and the input impedance of the measurement device is sufficient, the experimentally derived charge injection limits for Pt electrodes are larger than what has been reported historically. Significance: By identifying the instrumentation-related confounds biasing measurements of electrochemical safety limits, this work provides a more consistent basis for the assessment of Qinj for safety, as well as a framework for identifying and mitigating DC offset as a potential source of variability in electrophysiological findings across studies using TFMEAs.",

      "title": "mkvDB - A tiny key-value store wrapper around MongoDB",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p><a href=\"https://patx.github.io/mkvdb\">mkvDB</a> is a unified sync + async key-value store backed by PyMongo that provides a dead-simple and super tiny Redis-like API (<code>set</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>remove</code>, etc). MongoDB handles concurrency so mkvDB is inherently safe across threads, processes, and ASGI workers.</p> <p>A long time ago I wrote a key-value store called pickleDB. Since its creation it has seen many changes in API and backend. Originally it used <code>pickle</code> to store things, had about 50 API methods, and was really crappy. Fast forward it is heavily simplified relies on <code>orjson</code>. It has great performance for single process/single threaded applications that run on a persistent file system. Well news flash to anyone living under a rock, most modern real world scenarios are NOT single threaded and use multiple worker processes. pickleDB and its limitations with a single file writer would never actually be suitable for this. Since most of my time is spent working with ASGI servers and frameworks (namely my own, <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/micropie\">MicroPie</a>, I wanted to create something with the same API pickleDB uses, but safe for ASGI. So mkvDB (MongoKeyValueDataBase) was born. Essentially its a very tiny API wrapper around PyMongo. It has some tricks (scary dark magic) up its sleave to provide a consistent API across sync and async applications.</p> <p>```</p> <h1>Sync context</h1> <p>db = Mkv(&quot;mongodb://localhost:27017&quot;) db.set(&quot;x&quot;, 1) # OK value = db.get(&quot;x&quot;) # OK</p> <h1>Async context</h1> <p>async def foo(): db = Mkv(&quot;mongodb://localhost:27017&quot;) await db.set(&quot;x&quot;, 1) # must await value = await db.get(&quot;x&quot;) ```</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>mkvDB was made for lazy people. If you already know MongoDB you definitely do not need this wrapper. But if you know MongoDB are lazy like me and need to spin up a couple different micro apps weekly (that DO NOT need a complex product relational schema) then this API is super convenient. I don't know if ANYONE actually needs this, but I like the tiny API, and I'd assume a beginner would too (idk)? If PyMongo is already part of your stack, you can use mkvDB as a side car, not the main engine.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p>Nothing really directly competes with mkvDB (most likely for good reason lol). The API is based on <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/pickledb\">pickleDB</a>. <a href=\"https://dataset.readthedocs.io/\">DataSet</a> is also <em>sort</em> of like mkvDB but for SQL not Mongo.</p> <h3>Links and Other Stuff</h3> <p>Some useful links:</p> <ul> <li>Homepage: <a href=\"https://patx.github.io/mkvdb\">https://patx.github.io/mkvdb</a></li> <li>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mkvdb/\">https://pypi.org/project/mkvdb/</a></li> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/patx/mkvdb\">https://github.com/patx/mkvdb</a></li> </ul> <p>Reporting Issues</p> <ul> <li>Please report any issues, bugs, or glaring mistakes I made on the Github issues page.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable_Ear3789\"> /u/Miserable_Ear3789 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pk11us/mkvdb_a_tiny_keyvalue_store_wrapper_around_mongodb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pk11us/mkvdb_a_tiny_keyvalue_store_wrapper_around_mongodb/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN, Waleed here. We're building Sim (<a href=\"https://sim.ai/\">https://sim.ai/</a>), an open-source visual editor to build agentic workflows. Repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/simstudioai/sim/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/simstudioai/sim/</a>. Docs here: <a href=\"https://docs.sim.ai\">https://docs.sim.ai</a>.<p>You can run Sim locally using Docker, with no execution limits or other restrictions.<p>We started building Sim almost a year ago after repeatedly troubleshooting why our agents failed in production. Code-first frameworks felt hard to debug because of implicit control flow, and workflow platforms added more overhead than they removed. We wanted granular control and easy observability without piecing everything together ourselves.<p>We launched Sim [1][2] as a drag-and-drop canvas around 6 months ago. Since then, we've added:<p>- 138 blocks: Slack, GitHub, Linear, Notion, Supabase, SSH, TTS, SFTP, MongoDB, S3, Pinecone, ...<p>- Tool calling with granular control: forced, auto<p>- Agent memory: conversation memory with sliding window support (by last n messages or tokens)<p>- Trace spans: detailed logging and observability for nested workflows and tool calling<p>- Native RAG: upload documents, we chunk, embed with pgvector, and expose vector search to agents<p>- Workflow deployment versioning with rollbacks<p>- MCP support, Human-in-the-loop block<p>- Copilot to build workflows using natural language (just shipped a new version that also acts as a superagent and can call into any of your connected services directly, not just build workflows)<p>Under the hood, the workflow is a DAG with concurrent execution by default. Nodes run as soon as their dependencies (upstream blocks) are satisfied. Loops (for, forEach, while, do-while) and parallel fan-out/join are also first-class primitives.<p>Agent blocks are pass-through to the provider. You pick your model (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, vLLM), and and we pass through prompts, tools, and response format directly to the provider API. We normalize response shapes for block interoperability, but we're not adding layers that obscure what's happening.<p>We're currently working on our own MCP server and the ability to deploy workflows as MCP servers. Would love to hear your thoughts and where we should take it next :)<p>[1] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43823096\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43823096</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44052766\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44052766</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234186\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46234186</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Relative contribution of gonads and sex chromosomes to sex differences in cell-type gene expression in the mouse medial septum and sex-biased disease risk",
      "content": "Background While sex differences in the brain have traditionally been attributed to gonadal hormones, emerging evidence points to regulation by sex chromosomes. This study aims to differentiate the influence of gonads versus sex chromosomes on cellular gene expression in the mouse medial septum (MS), a critically understudied brain region. Methods Using single nucleus RNA-sequencing and the Sex Chromosome Trisomy mouse model, we (1) quantified sex differences in cellular gene expression and (2) isolated sex-biasing effects by identifying perturbed cell types, differentially expressed genes, biological pathways, and gene networks, which were integrated with GWAS data to explore links with sex-biased human phenotypes. Results Our analysis revealed that volumetric sex differences in the MS are mirrored by widespread transcriptomic changes across cell types. Critically, genetic effects displayed elevated relevance compared to sex hormones in driving sex-biased gene expression. These effects converge to regulate synaptic/neuronal development, transcriptional regulation, and cellular metabolism. Sex chromosome-associated DEGs were enriched for various human disorders, suggesting a cellular and mechanistic basis for their sex-biased patterns. Conclusions Our findings challenge the classical gonad-centric views of sexual differentiation, as the MS displays sex-biased transcriptional regulation driven by sex chromosome-associated effects that are highly relevant for human health.",

      "title": "Network Rerouting Under Ayahuasca: Temporally and Hemisphere-Resolved EEG Connectomics",
      "content": "Ayahuasca profoundly alters conscious experience, yet robust, time-resolved EEG markers of its network-level effects remain limited. We combined machine learning with complex-network analysis to quantify how functional connectivity reorganizes across time and hemispheres in resting-state EEG from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including three 5-min sessions: pre-dose (T1), 2 h post-dose (T2), and 4 h post-dose (T3). The cohort consisted of naive ayahuasca users, a population known to exhibit attenuated or more stable acute responses, making the detection of network-level changes particularly challenging. Connectivity was estimated using multiple metrics and sliding windows (10-120 s), and network features were computed and averaged to ensure statistical validity. A representation-selection step identified Spearman correlation and an intermediate temporal scale as optimal, with classification performance peaking at 60-70 s (independent-test AUC and accuracy = 0.93). Linear mixed models revealed a bilateral decrease in eigenvector centrality (weaker hub influence), increased degree heterogeneity in the right hemisphere, and reduced global efficiency in the left. Edge-level analyses localized these effects: Posterior-left connections weakened acutely (lowest at T2), whereas right temporal-central coupling transiently strengthened (highest at T2). Together, these convergent results support a mechanistic summary: as hub-centric shortcuts weaken, communication is increasingly routed through alternative, more distributed and less efficient pathways, with a right-lateralized expression at a later time. Methodologically, the window-optimized, hemisphere-resolved, and edge-validated pipeline extends prior EEG work and highlights temporal scale (approximately 60 s) as a biologically meaningful parameter for detecting psychedelic-induced network reorganization.",

      "title": "Therapeutic modulation of the calpastatin/calpain pathway restores calpain-mediated synaptic proteolysis and preserves motor neurons survival and function in C9orf72 ALS",
      "content": "A hexanucleotide repeat expansion (GGGGCC) in the C9orf72 gene is the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS, with early neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction being a key pathological feature. Current therapies provide only limited symptomatic relief, underscoring the need for targeted, mechanism-based interventions. Using a C9orf72 ALS zebrafish model (C9-miR) and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) motor neurons, we identified significant downregulation of calpastatin, the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, a calcium-dependent protease family implicated in neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that restoring calpastatin function through calpain inhibition with calpeptin or a novel calpastatin-derived peptide ameliorates locomotor deficits and NMJ dysfunction in the C9-miR zebrafish model. These interventions enhance synaptic vesicle turnover and quantal release at the NMJ while improving motor neuron excitability and synaptic integrity in iPSC-derived motor neurons. N-terminomic/TAILS mass spectrometry approaches revealed direct calpain-mediated cleavage of synaptic proteins in motor neurons derived from C9orf72 patients. Proteolysis of key synaptic proteins, such as spectrin, is prevented by calpeptin and calpastatin peptide treatments. Our findings establish the calpastatin/calpain axis as a pivotal regulator of synaptic function in C9orf72-associated ALS and identify it as a promising therapeutic target, offering a novel strategy to restore synaptic transmission and potentially halt disease progression.",

      "title": "A stuttering-associated Gnptab variant alters fine-motor kinematics",
      "content": "Precise reach-to-grasp movements rely on complex cortico-basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits, and can be affected by cellular pathway defects. We investigated whether mild Gnptab deficiency, affecting mannose-6-phosphate-dependent lysosomal enzyme targeting, impairs fine motor behaviors in mice. Using the staircase test, high-frame-rate video, and markerless tracking, we assessed reaching and grasping in Gnptab-mutant and control littermates. Our data suggest that Gnptab-mutant mice retrieved about 75% fewer pellets than controls and exhibited abnormal grasping, characterized by increased wrist extension and larger digit angles, decreased digital velocity, and shorter reach distances, while elbow angles remained largely unchanged. These findings suggest a specific deficit in grasp shaping and trajectory control, rather than overall limb positioning. Our data establishes a quantitative link between GNPTAB-related lysosomal pathway disruption and fine-motor impairments, providing a valuable model for understanding how cellular dysfunction impacts motor circuit function.",

      "title": "The Research Landscape of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Parkinson's Disease: Systematic Review and Interactive Tool",
      "content": "Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data has emerged as a powerful framework for characterizing the time-varying network disruptions underlying Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the rapid expansion of this field has introduced substantial methodological heterogeneity, creating a fragmented landscape that complicates knowledge synthesis and clinical translation. To address this, we performed a systematic review to map the conceptual and methodological diversity of dFC research in PD. Beyond a traditional static synthesis, we developed DynaPD, an open-source interactive application that allows researchers to dynamically explore study designs, analytical pipelines, and reported findings. Our synthesis of 37 eligible studies reveals a landscape defined by methodological contrast. While preprocessing strategies exhibited high variability (divergence), we observed a marked convergence on core analytical choices, specifically the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for parcellation and the sliding-window technique coupled with k-means clustering for state identification. Regarding empirical findings, a consensus emerged on the relevance of specific dynamic features - namely dwell time, fraction time, and number of transitions - yet clinical interpretations varied, particularly concerning the implications of strongly connected versus sparsely connected states. We further identified stated limitations across the studies, including a predominance of cross-sectional designs, small sample sizes, and inconsistent reporting standards. These findings highlight the urgent need for longitudinal studies with extended acquisition protocols and standardized reporting frameworks. By providing both a systematic evidence synthesis and a living interactive tool, this work aims to consolidate the diverse dFC literature, fostering a more coherent and cumulative path toward precision neurology in PD.",

      "title": "Analytical meditation improves physiological well-being in expert practitioners: a study on central and peripheral neurophysiological correlates",
      "content": "Meditation has been long associated with improvements in mental well-being, emotional regulation, and attentional control. Yet, the diversity of meditative techniques and participant expertise has hindered the systematic identification of their neurophysiological correlates supporting these benefits. To address this challenge, we investigated the neurophysiological signatures of concentrative and analytical meditation in 35 experienced Tibetan monk practitioners. EEG, ECG, EDA, and respiration were simultaneously recorded during Concentrative, Loving-Kindness and Emptiness meditations. Linear-mixed-models revealed significant modulations in autonomic and cortical activity across meditations. Peripheral indices indicated enhanced parasympathetic tone, decreases respiratory rate, and gradual increase in EDA - reflecting a state of relaxed-alertness with concurrent vagal engagement and sustained sympathetic arousal. EEG analyses supported this state showing elevated gamma-band power during analytical meditations. These findings suggest that advanced meditative states foster an adaptive integration of autonomic and cortical responses, supporting the emergence of relaxed-vigilance - a psychophysiological condition associated with well-being and cognitive flexibility.",
