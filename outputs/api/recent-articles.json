      "title": "Efficient in vivo mammalian neuron editing using peptide-mediated CRISPR enzyme delivery",
      "content": "CRISPR-mediated genome editing of the central nervous system (CNS) has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD). However, the development of CRISPR therapeutics for the CNS has been hindered by challenges associated with delivery, specifically the lack of a clinically compatible, non-viral delivery technology facilitating genome editing of neurons in vivo. For most indications, two key obstacles must be overcome before therapeutic genome editing of the brain is feasible: non-toxic intracellular delivery of CRISPR cargo into neurons and establishment of strategies enabling targeted brain regions to be edited efficiently. While viral vectors have shown promise in pre-clinical models, non-viral approaches present distinct advantages: ease of manufacture as well as the transient presence of CRISPR machinery, which tempers risks of genotoxicity and immunogenicity. Peptide-enabled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery of CRISPR (PERC) has emerged as a promising non-viral delivery strategy for CRISPR enzymes with initial use in primary human immune cells. In this study, we report the development of Neuro-PERC, a streamlined and optimized approach for in vivo editing of mammalian neurons. Administration of Neuro-PERC reagents via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) mediated efficient and well-tolerated neuronal genome editing. Neuro-PERC enabled robust neuronal editing in the brain of both small and large animal reporter models, and increased survival in a severe murine model of Huntington's disease. These results establish CED-administered Neuro-PERC as a candidate delivery technology to hasten clinical translation of CRISPR-based therapies for diseases of the CNS.",

      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",
