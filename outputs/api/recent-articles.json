      "content": "<p>Hey everyone, as you guys know we make a lot of changes to FMHY, but the current ways to track those changes are pretty limited. The only real options are joining Discord, or watching markdown commits on GitHub, neither of which is ideal for everyone.</p>\n<p>To help make things easier, the following two changelog sites have been built.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://changes.fmhy.bid/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://changes.fmhy.bid/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers changes that occur in both the #Recently-Added and #Monthly-Update channels in our Discord.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers links that have been added, updated, or removed by watching GitHub for changes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note that we will also continue to make the monthly posts same as always, and you can still follow updates by joining our <a href=\"https://redd.it/17f8msf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a>, or watching the <a href=\"https://github.com/fmhy/edit/commits/main/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commits Page</a> on GitHub yourself.</p>\n<p>We hope you guys like them, if you have any suggestions or questions feel free to let us know.</p>",

Key architectural decisions:<p>1. Volatile Memory: The backend writes nothing to disk. Once a session terminates, the data is irretrievable.\n2. Client-Side Entropy: The password generator runs locally in the browser; keys are never sent to the server.\n3. PWA: It's installable and designed for low latency using WebSockets for incoming mail (no polling).\n4. Mobile Handoff: You can transfer an active session to mobile via an encrypted QR code.<p>It is completely free and open for public use. I'd love to hear your feedback on the implementation and UI.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46300047\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46300047</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>",

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",
