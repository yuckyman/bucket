      "title": "Afterimages drive a shared visual motion reversal illusion in Drosophila",
      "content": "Illusions expose core computations in perception. In one visual apparent-motion illusion, perceptual direction is reversed when phase shifted gratings are interleaved with uniform frames. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila exhibits the same direction reversal reported in mammals. Combining behavior, targeted silencing, two photon imaging, and modeling, we localize the origin of this illusion to elementary motion pathways. Silencing direction selective T4/T5 neurons abolishes the reversal, and recordings reveal that downstream wide field neurons invert their directional preference as interleave duration increases. Replacing periodic gratings with random binary patterns preserves the reversal, implicating afterimages rather than spatial periodicity. Imaging neurons upstream of T4/T5 shows signatures of an afterimage, whose emergence depends on interleave luminance. Critically, dark interleaves suppress afterimages and eliminate both the neural and behavioral reversal, whereas light interleaves preserve or enhance it. Thus, afterimages are central to this shared illusion and explain a deficiency of canonical motion energy accounts. These results link a classic apparent motion phenomenon to identified circuit elements and reveal a simple stimulus manipulation that switches an illusion on and off.",

      "title": "Impact of impaired endogenous neurosteroidogenesis on outcomes following chronic alcohol exposure.",
      "content": "Alcohol use disorder is a major public health concern worldwide and there is a high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has been implicated in both mood and alcohol use disorders; however, the mechanisms contributing to the shared pathophysiology remain unknown. Extensive evidence indicates that ethanol modulates GABAergic signaling in the BLA, including actions on neurosteroid-sensitive, extrasynaptic {delta} subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs), which has been suggested to mediate many of the behavioral effects. In fact, several studies have suggested that 5-reduced neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, may mediate some of the behavioral effects of alcohol. Here we demonstrate that chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure impairs endogenous neurosteroidogenesis via downregulation of key neurosteroidogenic enzymes, 5-reductase type 1 and type 2. To examine the impact of impaired endogenous neurosteroidogenesis of the behavioral consequences of chronic alcohol exposure, including withdrawal-induced anxiety and increased alcohol consumption, we used CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown of 5-reductase in the BLA. Reduced expression of 5-reductase in the BLA did not impact post-CIE alcohol intake or anxiety-like behaviors during withdrawal, perhaps because endogenous neurosteroidogenesis is already impaired following CIE. Therefore, we examined the impact of enhancing neurosteroid levels, treating mice post-CIE with SGE-516, a synthetic GABAAR positive allosteric modulator, which increased voluntary alcohol intake. These findings implicate endogenous neurosteroidogenesis in behavioral outcomes associated with withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. Further, this study suggests that targeting endogenous neurosteroidogenesis may be a novel and useful therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Perceptual reaction times are coupled to the gastric electrical rhythm",
      "content": "The gastric rhythm, a slow (0.05 Hz) electrical oscillation continuously generated by the stomach, phase-synchronises neural activity across all sensory and motor cortices. Yet the functional relevance of this coupling remains unknown. We measured in humans the gastric rhythm with electrogastrography in three independent, distinct experiments (total N = 90): a speeded supra-threshold tactile detection task, a self-paced visual exploration task, and an unspeeded near-threshold visual detection task. Leveraging Spline Generalized Linear Modelling to flexibly uncover higher-order phase-amplitude coupling modes, we found perceptual reaction times (RTs) to be coupled to gastric phase across all experiments. Coupling to gastric phase was independent from effects of cardiac and respiratory rhythms' rates and phases. By showing that the gastric rhythm contributes to the internal state shaping perceptual variability on a scale comparable to cardiac and respiratory rhythms, this work opens a new avenue for the understanding of the function of gastric-brain coupling.",

      "title": "How Visual Context Influences Lateral Stepping Regulation While Walking on Winding Paths",
      "content": "Goal-directed walking involves regulating foot placements to achieve specific tasks. This requires visuomotor integration. Perceptual, cognitive, and contextual salience guide attention and motor planning for navigation. Here, we quantified how perceptual salience informs lateral foot placement while walking. Participants walked along prescribed virtual paths (straight or winding), thus keeping contextual salience (the task itself) constant. We manipulated perceptual salience by systematically altering environment richness (rich vs. sparse) and path color contrast (high vs. low). We thus tested the extent to which stepping control is determined only by the walking path (i.e. its shape), or is also influenced by task-relevant salience of the paths (only), and/or the salience of the surrounding environment. We quantified head pitch angle to approximate gaze direction. We quantified lateral stepping regulation from a Goal Equivalent Manifold framework. On winding (vs. straight) paths, participants looked down more (lower mean head pitch) and more consistently (less variable head pitch). They took narrower, more variable steps and corrected stepping errors more strongly. This confirmed the predominant influence of task (contextual salience) on stepping control. On low (vs. high) contrast paths, participants looked down more and exhibited greater variability in lateral position on their path with weaker error correction. Higher contrast paths elicited stronger and more consistent stepping control. Walking in sparse (vs. rich) environments yielded somewhat less consistent, but still significant changes in head pitch and stepping regulation. Salience manipulations affected stepping differently on straight versus winding paths. Therefore, perceptual salience influences step-to-step control during naturalistic walking.",

      "title": "The Vesicular Glutamate Transporter Modulates Sex and Region-Specific Differences in Dopaminergic Neuron \u03b1-Synuclein Toxicity by Modifying Cytosolic Dopamine Levels",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease disproportionately affects males; however, the cause of this sex difference is unknown. We found that expressing mutant -synuclein A53T in Drosophila dopamine neurons recapitulates the sex differences observed in human Parkinson's disease patients. Male flies exhibited greater age-related motor impairment and more severe dopamine neuron degeneration than females. Selective masculinization of female dopamine neurons via knockdown of the sex determination gene Transformer eliminated the observed sex differences in locomotor ability and neurodegeneration by increasing the severity of motor defects and degeneration in females. Transformer knockdown in dopamine neurons also reduced total vesicular glutamate transporter staining in the brain. Direct knockdown of the vesicular glutamate transporter in female dopamine neurons expressing -synuclein A53T exacerbated motor dysfunction, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and accelerated dopamine neuron degeneration. Increasing cytosolic dopamine via knockdown of the vesicular monoamine transporter or increasing total dopamine levels via levodopa treatment phenocopied vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown; furthermore, reducing total dopamine via alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine treatment protected against vesicular glutamate transporter knockdown. These results support a model in which lower VGLUT levels in dopamine neurons result in higher levels of cytosolic dopamine, which leads to dopamine mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and increased susceptibility to -synuclein A53T toxicity.",

      "title": "Measurement of tau protein and A\u03b2 amyloid plaques in postmortem human brains of Down syndrome and Alzheimers disease by using IBETA autoradiography",
      "content": "The accumulation of tau tangles and A{beta} plaques are prominent neuropathologies that characterize Alzheimers disease (AD) and Down Syndrome (DS). Continuous developments of PET tracers as biomarkers can be supported by autoradiography to validate effectiveness and accuracy of binding properties that elucidate the pathophysiology of DSAD and AD. This in vitro comparative study evaluates [125I]IPPI binding to tau and [125I]IBETA binding to A{beta} plaques in the frontal cortex (FCX) and temporal cortex (TCX) of postmortem human brain slices of AD (n=5), DSAD (n=5), and cognitively normal (CN) (n=5) cases. With anti-tau and anti-A{beta} immunostains confirming the presence of tau and A{beta} plaques, [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding in autoradiographic images were significantly higher in DSAD and AD gray matter (GM) compared to CN. When comparing DSAD with AD, FCX and TCX GM binding was similar throughout DSAD and AD except in FCX GM where there was 48% more [125I]IPPI binding in DSAD than AD. In vitro drug inhibition studies revealed that [125I]IPPI binding was significantly inhibited with increasing harmine concentrations (IC50=115{+/-}40 nM) in DSAD FCX and TCX but KuFal194 minimally inhibited [125I]IPPI binding in the same cases. The GM/white matter ratios for DSAD ([125I]IPPI=4.1, [125I]IBETA=2.9) and AD ([125I]IPPI=4.2, [125I]IBETA=2.6) were significantly greater than CN ([125I]IPPI=1.3, [125I]IBETA=1.2). A positive correlation between [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA binding suggests a synergistic relationship between tau and A{beta} plaque in DSAD and AD pathology. This study demonstrates that [125I]IPPI and [125I]IBETA may serve as novel radiotracers in both DSAD and AD to continue diagnostic investigations in vivo.",

      "title": "The core herpes simplex-1 fusion complex drives cell-to-cell spreading of pathological Tau",
      "content": "Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) are characterized by the pathological aggregation of the host-encoded protein Tau into amyloid fibrils. Pathologic protein aggregates composed of Tau are able to spread from cell-to-cell, thereby contributing to disease progression. The exact mechanisms of intercellular dissemination remain ill-defined. Mounting evidence links the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) to the aetiology of AD. HSV-1 is a prevalent neurotropic virus that replicates in epithelial cells at the site of infection, and subsequently establishes lifelong latency in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In the quiescent latent state, AD brains show elevated expression of structural viral proteins in the absence of virus production. We hypothesized that HSV-1 glycoproteins involved in viral attachment and fusion facilitate the intercellular spreading of proteopathic seeds. Using cellular models, we demonstrate that expression of the HSV-1 core fusion complex, essential for viral entry and direct cell-to-cell transmission, is sufficient to promote aggregate dissemination between cells. Moreover, anti-HSV-1 antibodies present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with HSV-1 encephalitis efficiently neutralize viral infection, block viral cell-to-cell transmission, and inhibit propagation of pathological Tau. Thus, latent HSV-1 infection of the brain could contribute to neurodegenerative disease progression, and antiviral antibodies may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.",
