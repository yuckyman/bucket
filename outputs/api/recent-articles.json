      "title": "Associative emotional memory encoding: Insights from network stability analysis of an fMRI-driven bilinear dynamics",
      "content": "The interplay between emotion and memory is a central topic in cognitive neuroscience, with open questions about the underlying neuronal mechanisms. This article studies dynamic interactions among the hippocampus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex during an fMRI associative memory encoding task. Participants were clustered into three condition groups: Neutral Neutral, Neutral Emotional, or Emotional Emotional, and viewed image pairs associated with their assigned condition. Using the dynamic causal modeling framework, we explore several dynamic models and show that a stochastic bilinear state space model best describes the neuronal dynamics in all conditions. Furthermore, we use graph and control theory techniques to both validate and analyze the model. In particular, we analyze the network dynamics of each condition using tools from graph theory and stability theory and discuss the differences in the strength and direction of connectivity as well as the stability of each of these networks. We confirm the prior finding that memory is enhanced in emotional conditions, in particular in the Neutral Emotional condition. In our work, this enhanced memory is associated with increased hippocampus amygdala coupling and overall network connectivity. In addition, we show that in the Emotional Emotional condition, the coupling of the hippocampus and amygdala, as well as the whole network connectivity increases when the first image valence is substantially less negative rated than the second image. This pattern mirrors the Neutral Emotional condition, where the first image is neutral compared with the second one. Moreover, our model based analyses suggest that the amygdala predominantly influences the other two regions in the Neutral Emotional condition, whereas the OFC plays a dominant role in the other two conditions. Combined data driven modeling, stability analyses, and graph theory tools led to new insights and enhanced the mechanistic understanding of cortical dynamics of emotional associative memory. We discuss these insights, utilize these analytical tools to generalize our findings to some unmeasured conditions, and highlight the potential of these techniques to inform the design of future regulatory mechanisms.",

      "title": "Injury-transduced SerpinOLs modulate neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS",
      "content": "Oligodendroglial dysfunction is common in CNS diseases, but the molecular and functional responses of oligodendroglia to CNS pathologies remain poorly defined. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes (OLs) respond to demyelinating diseases by dysregulating serine protease inhibitor clade A member 3N (SERPINA3N). Homeostatic OLs transition to Serpina3n-expressing OLs (SerpinOLs) under other diseased conditions including stroke, endotoxicity, neurodegeneration, neurotrauma, and non-diseased healthy aging conditions. Mechanistically, CNS inflammation or inflammatory mediators is sufficient for SerpinOL transition. Instead, oligodendrocyte injury even in the absence of neuroinflammation or glial activation is sufficient for the transition. Phenotypically, SerpinOLs are characterized by molecular signatures of inflammatory and immune regulation and STAT3 signaling activation. Functionally, SerpinOLs exacerbate neuroinflammation and promote glial activation toward pro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative states. Together, our findings suggest SerpinOLs are a common population of injury-transduced OLs that amplify neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS through SERPINA3N secretion. Our findings provide new insights into myelination-independent role of OLs in regulating CNS pathophysiology.",

      "title": "Linear and Nonlinear Oscillatory Functional Brain Networks in Euthymic Bipolar Disorder Classification",
      "content": "Functional brain network (FBN) dysconnectivity has been repeatedly reported in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unclear how this dysconnectivity manifests from the perspective of oscillatory FBNs, that is, which network measures and frequency bands most reliably capture this alteration. Moreover, it is unknown whether this dysconnection is predominantly expressed through linear or nonlinear interactions. Here, we investigated properties of oscillatory FBNs in individuals with euthymic BD. Networks were constructed using linear and nonlinear connectivity measures applied to source-localized resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) current density signals. We then quantified whole-FBN and nodal features using conventional and spectral graph theory methods to characterize disorder-related network mechanisms and evaluate their potential as biomarkers. Significant group differences between BD and control groups were observed in the theta and alpha1 bands. Dynamical whole-FBN alterations were detected primarily in linear oscillatory FBNs, with reduced Shannon entropy and energy in the BD group. These effects were replicated using machine learning, achieving 85% classification accuracy with entropy and energy as the most informative features. In contrast, nodal-level differences emerged mainly in nonlinear FBNs, revealing increased centrality in frontal, and decreased centrality across temporal, and limbic regions. These findings emphasize distinct, frequency-specific roles of linear and nonlinear oscillatory FBNs in BD, with global dysconnectivity reflected in linear FBNs and local alterations captured by nonlinear connectivity. Moreover, network measures related to synchronization stability and complexity more effectively capture BD-related dysconnectivity, suggesting that dynamic features of oscillatory FBNs may serve as potential biomarkers for BD.",

      "title": "Hippocampal Projections to the Striatal Compartments, Striosome and Matrix, are Spatially Segregated in CA1",
      "content": "The hippocampus routes information to the striatum through at least four polysynaptic circuits. Striatal projection neurons are organized into two tissue compartments, the matrix and striosome, which differ in their embryologic origins, relative abundance, intra-striate location, and afferent and efferent connectivity. These compartments are embedded in distinct functional networks and are activated by different tasks. Consequently, hippocampal inputs that route preferentially through the striosome may underpin different functions and engage with different remote networks than inputs that route through the matrix. It was unknown whether striosome-bound and matrix-bound projections from the hippocampus followed different polysynaptic circuits. We assessed hippocampo-striate projections in living humans using probabilistic diffusion tractography by first parcellating the striatum into voxels with striosome-like and matrix-like structural connectivity. We then quantified structural connectivity between hippocampal efferents (CA1) to each set of compartment-like voxels. CA1 projections to striosome-like voxels in the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) were 3.1-fold more abundant than those to matrix-like voxels, particularly in caudo-lateral CA1. This striosome-favoring bias was similar in three segregated hippocampo-striate circuits, in streamlines routing through the subiculum, lateral septum, or medial prefrontal cortex. However, a small region in rostro-medial CA1 preferentially targeted matrix-like voxels. Functional connectivity between CA1 and compartment-like voxels matched this segregated pattern: CA1 activation was correlated with striosome-like voxels but anti-correlated with matrix-like voxels. Additionally, streamlines from CA1 to nucleus accumbens exhibited hemispheric asymmetries, with the left hemisphere biased towards matrix and the right towards striosome. These findings suggest that hippocampo-striate projections are spatially segregated into compartment-specific circuits.",

      "content": "Sensory neuron soma and non-neuronal cells in adult dorsal root ganglia (DRG) derive from multipotent neural crest cells. Satellite glial cells (SGCs), which surround neuronal soma, were suggested to retain developmental potential, but the precise molecular identity of progenitor cells in the adult DRG remains undefined. To address this question, we assembled a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas by integrating over 200,000 DRG and sciatic nerve transcriptomes across multiple studies and injury paradigms. High-resolution clustering resolved 26 cell types and demonstrated significant transcriptional heterogeneity within SGCs and Schwann cells, including repair and reactive sub-states. Crucially, we identified two distinct populations of progenitor cells that reflect different states in the progenitor trajectory. Functionally, progenitor cell numbers significantly increase after injury, and endothelin signaling regulates glial cell proliferation early in development. This integrated DRG and peripheral nerve cell atlas represents an essential resource for exploring new features of the peripheral nervous system.",

      "title": "Valence-specific ensembles in the laterodorsal tegmentum encode salient stimuli and modulate motivated behavior",
      "content": "The laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) is a brainstem hub that integrates sensory and motivational signals to regulate adaptive behavior. While LDT neurons are known to modulate reward and aversion, whether salient stimuli recruit distinct neuronal ensembles within this structure remains unknown. Here, combined cell-type-specific calcium imaging, activity-dependent genetic tagging (TRAP2), and optogenetic reactivation to investigate how rewarding and aversive stimuli recruit and functionally define LDT neurons. Notably, single exposures to cocaine or shock in TRAP2;Ai14 mice labeled spatially and neurochemically distinct ensembles, with minimal overlap. We used fiber photometry and TRAP2 system to tag active neuronal ensembles in the LDT during cocaine (coca-LDT) and foot shock (shock-LDT) exposure, expressing GCaMP8m (green) in these neurons and, simultaneously, sRGECO (red) in the whole LDT. Our results demonstrate coca-LDT activation by physical aversive events and valenced odours, with reduced activity in response to rewarding liquids. Shock-LDT showed activation by physical aversive events, odours, and shock-predictive cues. Additionally, optogenetic reactivation of cocaine-TRAPed ensembles in a two-choice operant task biased action selection toward stimulation-paired responses, whereas shock-TRAPed ensemble activation did not drive avoidance. These findings identify functionally segregated LDT ensembles recruited by opposing motivational stimuli and reveal a causal role for reward-activated brainstem ensembles in shaping behavior. This functional segregation may contribute to the brain's ability to differentiate stimulus types and, to some extent, valence experiences. Our results may provide evidence on how the LDT influences decision-making processes in addiction and anxiety disorders, potentially paving the way for novel therapeutic approaches.",

      "content": "The hippocampal formation is a highly curved and topographically complex forebrain structure. This complex geometry presents persistent challenges for analyzing subregional, laminar, and connectivity patterns. Here, we present a computational workflow that generates curvilinear-coordinate flatmaps from Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) registered hippocampal and retrohippocampal regions by solving the Laplacian equation to derive geodesic streamlines. This transformation unfolds the hippocampus into a planar slab, bounded by the meningeal and ventricular surfaces, with the depth defined along the radial axis. We apply this transform to image volumes, single neuron reconstructions, and point data, including spatial transcriptomic and rabies tracing datasets, revealing topographic variations in the dorsoventral and radial axes that are obscured in the CCF coordinate space. As proof of principle, we use flatmaps to show connectivity loss in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and track postnatal development of microglial distribution in the hippocampus. This work provides an efficient and accessible resource for visualizing hippocampal organization across development and disease, offering new opportunities to interrogate the structure and function of this important brain region.",

      "content": "The microglial CD33 gene is overexpressed in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and multiple CD33 genetic variants are directly linked to disease risk. Here, we investigate CD33 function in induced human microglial cells by increasing or decreasing CD33 levels with AAV6-mediated gene transfer and with CD33-targeting siRNA, respectively. Phagocytosis of oligomeric amyloid beta into live microglia was doubled by reducing CD33 levels, with concomitant increases in secreted TREM2 and in TREM2 activation as assayed by phosphorylation of downstream SYK. Increasing CD33 had opposing effects on microglial activity, decreasing amyloid beta uptake by approximately half, reducing LPS-induced increases in IL-10, and decreasing the efficacy of a TREM2-activating antibody. Experiments combining siRNA and AAV6 demonstrated a linear relationship between CD33 protein and amyloid beta uptake. Results show that CD33 largely governs multiple microglial functions associated with Alzheimer's disease and affects both pharmacological and physiological activation of TREM2.",

      "title": "Unconstrained Plasticity Disrupts Memory Consolidation in a Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome",
      "content": "Memory impairment is a hallmark cognitive deficit in Rett syndrome (RTT). Yet, long-term memory deficits in RTT animal models remain poorly understood, largely due to the technical challenges inherent in tracking neural activity over extended periods. Here, we used longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to follow the same population of hippocampal CA1 neurons as RTT mice and their littermate controls formed cognitive maps of their environment during a spatial learning task. Neural representations in RTT mice were marked by excessive place cell (PC) activity, with individual PCs exhibiting pronounced instability across days. This disrupted single-cell stability propagated to the population level, resulting in unstable ensemble codes that poorly retained previously learned task information. Both excessive PC recruitment and instability could be attributed to a higher incidence of behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) in RTT mice. In wild-type littermates, place-cell consolidation across days is reflected by an increased likelihood of neuron-specific synaptic plasticity at the location of prior PC coding. This cellular mechanism of memory consolidation based on the location of BTSP was disrupted in RTT mice, where excessive and ectopic plasticity reduced PC stability, and degraded long-term stable representations. Backed by theoretical modeling, these results identify a plausible cellular and circuit-level mechanism underlying memory impairments in RTT mice and suggest principles that may be generalized to other neurological disorders involving memory deficits.",

Robust to non-manifold flaps and other artifacts common in production workflows.</p> <p>Simple code just works. Meshes cache structures on demand. Algorithms figure out what they need. NumPy arrays in, NumPy arrays out, works with your existing scipy/pandas pipelines. Spatial trees are built once and reused across transformation updates, enabling real-time interactive applications. Pre-built Blender add-on with live preview booleans included.</p> <p><strong>Live demos</strong>: Interactive mesh booleans, cross-sections, collision detection, and more. Mesh-size selection from 50k to 500k triangles. Compiled to WASM: <a href=\"https://trueform.polydera.com/live-examples/boolean\">https://trueform.polydera.com/live-examples/boolean</a></p> <p><strong>Building interactive applications with VTK/PyVista:</strong> Step-by-step tutorials walk you through building real-time geometry tools: collision detection, boolean operations, intersection curves, isobands, and cross-sections. Each example is documented with the patterns for VTK integration: zero-copy conversion, transformation handling, and update loops. Drag meshes and watch results update live: <a href=\"https://trueform.polydera.com/py/examples/vtk-integration\">https://trueform.polydera.com/py/examples/vtk-integration</a></p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Production use and research. These are Python bindings for a C++ library we've developed over years in the industry, designed to handle geometry and topology that has accumulated artifacts through long processing pipelines: non-manifold edges, inconsistent winding, degenerate faces, and other defects.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>On 1M triangles per mesh (M4 Max): 84\u00d7 faster than CGAL for boolean union, 233\u00d7 for intersection curves. 37\u00d7 faster than libigl for self-intersection resolution. 38\u00d7 faster than VTK for isocontours.
