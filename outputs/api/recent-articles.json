      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Hypovolemia Evokes Conserved Inverse Neurovascular Coupling in the Supraoptic Nucleus Independent of Heart Failure",
      "content": "Vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) are activated by systemic challenges that threaten fluid balance. Beyond their classical activity-dependent release of their neuropeptide cargo into the systemic circulation, these neurons also release AVP somatodendritically, enabling local modulation of neuronal excitability and vascular tone. We previously showed that a systemic salt challenge triggers inverse neurovascular coupling (iNVC) in the SON, in which activity-dependent dendritic AVP release induces parenchymal arteriole vasoconstriction and local hypoxia. In rats with heart failure (HF), however, the polarity of this salt-evoked response is reversed: microglia-derived adenosine acting on A2A receptors overrides an enhanced AVP-mediated vasoconstriction, producing net vasodilation. Still, whether AVP activation by non-osmotic stimuli engages similar neurovascular mechanisms is unknown. Here, we examined whether hypovolemia induced by intraperitoneal polyethylene glycol (PEG) evokes comparable vascular responses in control and HF rats. PEG produced a sustained rise in plasma protein concentration and vasoconstriction of SON parenchymal arterioles in both control and sham rats. In HF rats, PEG still induced vasoconstriction at 60 min, but vascular diameters returned to baseline by 90 min despite persistent hypovolemia. These findings indicate that hypovolemia engages a conserved AVP-mediated iNVC program that remains largely intact in HF, and that the previously described polarity reversal during HF is stimulus-specific, emerging during osmotic but not hypovolemic activation of AVP neurons.",

      "title": "Injury-induced tau pathology promotes aggressive behavior in Drosophila without neurodegeneration.",
      "content": "The microtubule-associated protein tau is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, but its physiological roles remain poorly understood. Here, we find that pan-neuronal expression of human tau (HsTau) in Drosophila coupled with injury triggers hyper-aggression in male flies, which is absent in flies expressing non-phosphorylatable tau. These behavioral manifestations result from activation of dopaminergic circuits without neurodegeneration. Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we find that phosphorylated HsTau maintains microtubule binding but loses its ability to suppress catastrophes, thereby promoting microtubule dynamicity. In contrast, unphosphorylated HsTau and fly tau (DmTau) stabilize microtubules by reducing catastrophe frequency. Our findings challenge the canonical view of tau as a simple microtubule stabilizer and instead position it as a dynamic regulator of microtubule function and neuronal excitability. These results reveal how acute tau phosphorylation can alter neural circuit function and behavior prior to neurodegeneration, providing new insights into tau's physiological and pathological roles.",
