      "title": "Pooling quantitative MRI data: A multi-protocol study of healthy subcortical ageing",
      "content": "Quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures relaxation rates, exchange rates and proton densities that reflect the biophysical properties of tissue and are ideally free from protocol- and scanner-dependence. In practice, qMRI has not yet achieved this level of independence from sequence and hardware choice, and quantitative measurements often differ across sites and acquisition schemes. At the same time pooling data across different sources can be beneficial to statistical power of longitudinal, cross-sectional or case-control studies. Here we investigate how protocol and hardware differences can affect pooling data from difference sources in large ultra high field (UHF) qMRI studies in the context of healthy aging. We combine the openly available ageing UHF qMRI MP2RAGEME-based dataset with two different MPM-based sets of qMRI data. We evaluate how pooling affects age dependence of qMRI parameters and investigate protocol-related biases, with a particular focus on subcortical structures. We focus the analysis, first, on replication and expansion of the reference qMRI dataset on normative aging, second, the examination of the protocol influence on the measured qMRI values, and third, on detecting the protocol effect on the age dependence inferred from the data. We find that the age-related changes for R1, R2* and volume detected by different protocols were of the same order of magnitude supporting the idea that age-related inter-individual variability can be correctly grasped across sites and protocols using qMRI approaches. We further observe larger relative difference across protocols for R1 and volume, while R2* remains more consistent for most regions. We therefore provide assessment of the pooling effects in the ultra-high resolution UHF qMRI data performed over a relatively large participant cohort, comprising data from different sites collected with different quantitative protocols.",

      "title": "Convergence of Cortical and Thalamic Origins of Free Behavior Modulation of Mouse Primary Visual Cortex",
      "content": "The quality of sensory information flow in the brain may be affected by uninstructed free animal behavior. However, the specific circuit pathways that merge sensory and free behavior remain obscure. In mouse primary visual cortex (V1), we combine two-photon calcium imaging of cortical neurons and thalamo-cortical LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus) boutons with simultaneous measurements of facial movements. When controlling for spurious time-structured 'nonsense' correlations, we observed representations of both eye movements and non-ocular facial movement features in both LGN bouton and V1 cortical neuron activity during grating input stimulation. Further, the correlation between V1 neurons and facial movement is larger for grating stimulation compared to blank stimulation, likely due to the integration of LGN inputs and modulation of V1 from higher brain centers during grating stimulation. Together, our results suggest a convergence of uninstructed non-visual signals from a persistent top-down pathway and a stimulus-gated bottom-up pathway in primary visual cortex.",

      "title": "Successful single-session neural self-regulation through neurofeedback varies between features",
      "content": "Neurofeedback (NFB) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research seldom present within-session individual learning dynamics. This is even though a large proportion of NFB and BCI users cannot learn the neural self-regulation required to control the feedback. Understanding the time course and learning dynamics between subjects will enable us to design more effective NFB and BCI protocols that promote the learning of neural self-regulation. In this study, we aimed to analyze individual learning trajectories of self-regulation of four different cortical rhythms, in terms of both frequency and spatial selectivity. Twenty healthy subjects performed four sessions of NFB training, each session with feedback reflecting a different cortical rhythm as measured with an electroencephalogram. We specifically tested frontal midline (fm) Theta, occipital Alpha, unilateral centrotemporal sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), and central Beta. We show that all subjects were able to self-regulate at least two of these features, however, with varied specificity in the spatial and frequency domains. Unexpectedly, we show that none of the subjects succeeded in regulating fm Theta. Using a clustering approach, we identified two different learning dynamics among the learners across features: a linear increase/decrease and a non-linear plateau-like trajectory. This is the first NFB study employing an intra-subject cross-over experimental design, enabling the direct comparison of neural self-regulation between multiple features. Our results provide important insights into the \"non-learner\" problem, showing that it is not a feature-universal personal trait. We further show feature-specific spatial and frequency selectivity of neural self-regulation, providing important considerations for future NFB protocols.",

      "title": "Consumption of processed foods impairs memory function through dietary advanced glycation end-products",
      "content": "Consumption of processed foods is associated with dementia, obesity, and other negative health outcomes. Sustained heat treatment, a common food processing approach to enhance flavor, induces the chemical Maillard reaction that promotes the formation of dietary advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). The neurocognitive impacts of consuming dietary AGEs are poorly understood. Here we modeled an AGE-rich diet through heat treatment fed to rats during adolescence, a critical period of neural development, to mechanistically evaluate the long-term impact of early life dietary AGEs on behavioral and neural processes. Consuming the AGE-rich diet impaired hippocampal-dependent memory function and altered the gut microbiome without inducing obesity or nonspecific behavioral deficits. AGE-induced memory deficits were coupled with impaired hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic neurotransmission and altered expression in the synapse-pruning complement system. Hippocampal synaptic deficits likely result from direct AGE-complement interactions, as our extended studies reveal competitive antagonist action of AGEs on complement receptors. Memory impairments were prevented by administration of the AGE-inhibitor, alagebrium, and by supplementation with an AGE-inhibiting bacterial taxon, Lactococcus lactis, which was depleted in the heat-treated diet. These findings reveal a functional connection between early life dietary AGEs, the microbiome, and memory impairments, thus illuminating mechanisms through which food processing negatively impacts neurocognition.",

      "title": "Bioengineered extracellular vesicles mitigate neuroinflammation by neutralizing pneumolysin and delaying disease onset in experimental pneumococcal meningitis",
      "content": "Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening neurological disorder frequently caused by a Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) infection of the brain. Standard treatment consists of antibiotics to eliminate bacteria and dexamethasone to reduce inflammation. Despite this, mortality reaches 20% in treated individuals, and half of the survivors suffer long-term neurological sequelae. This is largely due to the poor capacity of antibiotics to reach the brain and the lack of antimicrobial treatment capable of neutralizing the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin (Ply). To address these limitations, we isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human HEK293T cells and evaluated their therapeutic potential in pneumococcal meningitis. Alongside wild-type EVs (WT.EVs), we bioengineered EVs to express RVG peptides (RVG.EV) for targeting neuronal acetylcholine receptors, signal incompetent IL-6 signal transducer (IL-6ST) decoy receptors (IL-6.EV) to block the pro-inflammatory signalling of IL-6, or EVs expressing both RVG peptides and IL-6ST (DB.EV). In vitro, all EVs reduced pneumococcal adhesion to neurons and mitigated cytotoxicity by binding and sequestering Ply. In a bacteremia-derived pneumococcal meningitis model, EV treatment significantly increased the survival of the mice without affecting bacterial load in the brain or the periphery. Among all groups, RVG.EV treatment was most effective in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the periphery and brain. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of bioengineered EVs, particularly RVG peptides expressing EVs, as an adjunctive treatment for pneumococcal meningitis thanks to their (i) sequestration and neutralization of Ply, (ii) increased blood-brain barrier crossing, and (iii) dampening of inflammation.",
