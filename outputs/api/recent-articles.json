      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

      "content": "Visual motion perception declines during natural aging in most animals including humans. Edible berries of blackcurrant (BC) and its extracted anthocyanins (BCAs) have beneficial effects on human eyes. However, the effect of BCAs on the perception of moving objects and other dynamic visual patterns remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether BCAs improve visual movement perception in aging mice. The aging mice were fed either a standard diet or a standard diet containing BC....",

      "content": "Brain Tumor Segmentation (BTS) is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing CNN and Transformer-based methods often struggle with feature fusion and limited training data. While recent large-scale vision models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP offer potential, SAM is trained on natural images, lacking medical domain knowledge, and its decoder struggles with accurate tumor segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose the Medical SAM-Clip Grafting...",

Anemia, which is a widespread condition that affects billions of people worldwide, compromises oxygen transport due to low hemoglobin levels, which leads to severe complications if left undetected. Early and frequent monitoring is essential, yet traditional blood tests can be invasive, costly, and impractical for continuous assessment. This study presents the first...",

Post-mortem inspection of the lungs during slaughter also provides valuable insights into disease occurrence, offering useful feedback on the efficacy of on-farm prevention and control strategies. However, manual assessment protocols may be impaired by high slaughtering speeds and low inter-rater agreement, which limits continuous...",
