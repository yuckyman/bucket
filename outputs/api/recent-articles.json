      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) is a promising intervention for treatment-resistant depression, yet objective biomarkers that track recovery remain limited. This study examined longitudinal changes in stimulation-evoked potentials (SEPs) to characterize how SCC-driven cortical communication evolves during treatment. Ten patients across three SCC-DBS trials underwent high-density EEG recordings at 4 and 24 weeks. SEP features were extracted from source-localized SCC signals and related to clinical outcomes and fractional anisotropy (FA) of midcingulate cingulum fibers. Cortical responses showed a consistent reduction in latency and an increase in magnitude over time, indicating faster and stronger electrocortical signaling with chronic stimulation. Higher baseline midcingulate FA predicted greater latency acceleration, linking SEP timing to white-matter integrity. These findings identify temporal SEP dynamics as candidate mechanistic biomarkers that reflect circuit engagement during SCC-DBS and offer a pathway toward physiology-guided optimization of neuromodulation for depression.",

      "content": "<p>I've worked at several companies during the past two decades and I kept encountering the same issues with internal technical proposals:<p>- Authors would change a spec after I started writing code<p>- It's hard to find what proposals would benefit from my review<p>- It's hard to find the right person to review my proposals<p>- It's not always obvious if a proposal has reached consensus (e.g. buried comments)<p>- I'm not notified if a proposal I approved is now ready to be worked on<p>And that's just scratching the surface. The most popular solutions (like Notion or Google Drive + Docs) mostly lack semantics. For example it's easy as a human to see a table in a document with rows representing reviewers and a checkbox representing review acceptance but it's hard to formally extract meaning and prevent a document from \"being published\" when criteria isn't met.<p>RFC Hub aims to solve these issues by building an easy to use interface around all the metadata associated with technical proposals instead of containing it textually within the document itself.<p>The project is still under heavy development as I work on it most nights and weekends. The next big feature I'm planning is proposal templates and the ability to refer to documents as something other than RFCs (Request for Comments). E.g. a company might have a UIRFC for GUI work (User Interface RFCs), a DBADR (Database Architecture Decision Record), etc. And while there's a built-in notification system I'm still working on a Slack integration. Auth works by sending tokens via email but of course RFC Hub needs Google auth.<p>Please let me know what you think!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46109843\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46109843</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Projection-defined ventral tegmental area neurons exhibit distinct fentanyl-induced molecular and functional adaptations that differentially support drug-context associations",
      "content": "Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are contributing to unprecedented overdose rates. Despite the abundance of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, an understanding of fentanyl s effects on the brain remains lacking. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an important site of fentanyl s rewarding actions in the brain and sends diverse projections to several regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previous work shows downstream projection target influences baseline properties and opioid-induced neuroadaptations in VTA, but most work has focused on single neurotransmitter-defined cell types. Here, we investigate how projection-defined VTA neurons exhibit different responses to fentanyl independent of cell type. We use RNA sequencing to show that fentanyl induces discordant transcriptional adaptations in VTA neurons that project to NAc vs PFC. We then used fiber photometry and chemogenetics to characterize functional differences in fentanyl-related behavior. We found different timescales of activation between VTA-NAc and VTA-PFC during conditioned place preference that support distinct aspects of fentanyl-context association. Together, our data demonstrate that based on projection target alone, VTA neurons can undergo vastly different adaptations in response to fentanyl, providing new insight into VTA encoding of opioid behaviors.",

      "title": "Intranigral injection of Alpha-Synuclein pre-formed fibrils leads to BBB compromise and Bilateral Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in A53T Alpha-Synuclein transgenic mice.",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-Synuclein neuronal aggregation and loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Developing animal models that replicate PD neuropathological phenotypes is critical for understanding its pathophysiology and evaluating potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we show that direct unilateral injection of human Synuclein PFFs into the Substantia Nigra (SN) of mutant A53T alpha-synuclein overexpressing mice induce bilateral phosphorylated alpha-Synuclein (pS129) pathology in the SN. This pathology spreads to the striatum, cerebral cortex, and midbrain within 60 days and is accompanied by neuroinflammation in the midbrain and cerebral cortex. Additionally, we observed synuclein-dependent neurodegeneration, with a 50% reduction in Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) intensity in the SN and a 40% reduction in Striatum, both bilaterally. The model also revealed a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and T-cell infiltration in the PFF injected animals, correlating with pS129 pathology and neuroinflammation. Taken together, we developed a mouse model that recapitulates multiple PD phenotypes, providing a valuable platform for testing therapeutic strategies targeting human alpha-Synuclein pathology and for exploring CNS-peripheral immune interactions in PD.",

      "title": "Early, sex-dependent and progressive proteomic imbalance in the amygdala during Alzheimers disease progression",
      "content": "Background: The amygdala is involved in the emotional expression, memory processing and managing stimulatory input. Although amygdala atrophy is early evidenced in Alzheimers Disease (AD), the molecular mechanisms disrupted in initial neuropathological stages are still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the proteomic impairment of the amygdaloid region from AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects to better understand the neuropathological processes occurred early in this area and to identify potential targets that may face AD from the beginning of the disease. Methods: Label-free quantitative proteomics was applied using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass-spectrometer in 24 postmortem amygdala specimens derived from non-demented (n=3F/5M), AD-Braak stage I-II (n=4F/4M) and AD-Braak stage III-IV (n=4F/4M). Data analysis was performed using MaxQuant and Perseus software (two-way Student T-test; p<0.05). Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis softwares were considered for biological interpretation. Connectivity map platform was used for drug repurposing analyses. Transcriptomic/proteomic data of other brain regions were obtained from AlzData, Neuropro, and Agora repositories. Results: Amygdaloid proteome of AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects compared to controls revealed a progressive proteomic impairment with a minimal overlap across Braak stages. Some of the amygdaloid DEPs were known interactors of human A{beta} plaques, APP, or Tau proteins or were previously identified at transcriptional or translational level in other brain regions affected by AD. Interestingly, amygdaloid proteome was more severely affected in women than in men with a particular protein expression profile associated to each AD stage. Comparing our sex-dependent differential proteome datasets with transcriptomic data of different brain regions, we identified potential sex-specific proteins related to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Finally, data-driven drug repositioning using amygdaloid omics profiles unveiled that most of the small molecule candidates were neuropathological stage and/or sex-specific. Conclusions: Early and sex-specific amygdaloid proteome dysregulation in AD highlights the consideration of a deliberate stratification by sex in future research and clinical trials to develop effective therapeutic strategies in AD for both sexes.",
