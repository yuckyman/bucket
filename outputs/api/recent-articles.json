      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
      "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "An Active Insole to Reduce Plantar Pressure Loading: Using Predictive Finite Element Driven Soft Hydraulic Actuators to Minimize Plantar Pressure and the Pressure Time Integral for Diabetic Foot Ulceration Risk Management",
      "content": "Objective: This article aims to design, manufacture and evaluate an active insole to reduce plantar tissue loading to minimise the risk of diabetic foot ulceration for people living with diabetes. Methods: A prototype hydraulic soft robotic actuating insole was produced. It was controlled by an approximate finite element model of the participants\u2019 foot with a cost function to minimise plantar pressure loading and the pressure time integral. The system was evaluated during treadmill walking activity for 3 people (two people with diabetes and one healthy participant), measuring normal plantar stress in shoe both before and after shape changes. Results: The results from the participants demonstrate a reduction in average peak plantar pressure and pressure time integral by 35% [range from 9% - 52%] and 31% [range from 6% - 44%], respectively, at the high-risk region, whilst minimising edge effect and maintaining gait symmetry, regularity and cadence. The finite element driven controller was implemented when participants rested between walking periods, and it took less than six minutes to run. Conclusion: This study demonstrates, for the first time on diabetic participants, the feasibility of an active insole system using predictive finite element driven soft hydraulic actuators to reduce plantar loading in people with diabetes. Significance: Diabetic foot ulceration risk could be reduced using active insole technology and approximate predictive algorithms could play an important role to outwork this in real world activity.",

      "title": "Optimizing Non-Intersecting Synthetic Vascular Trees in Nonconvex Organs",
      "content": "Objective: The understanding of the mechanisms driving vascular development is still limited. Techniques to generate vascular trees synthetically have been developed to tackle this problem. However, most algorithms are limited to single trees inside convex perfusion volumes. We introduce a new framework for generating multiple trees inside general nonconvex perfusion volumes. Methods: Our framework combines topology optimization and global geometry optimization into a single algorithmic approach. Our first contribution is defining a baseline problem based on Murray's original formulation, which accommodates efficient solution algorithms. The problem of finding the global minimum is cast into a nonlinear optimization problem (NLP) with merely super-linear solution effort. Our second contribution extends the NLP to constrain multiple vascular trees inside any nonconvex boundary while avoiding intersections. We test our framework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a vasculature of the human liver. Results: In all cases, the total tree energy is improved significantly compared to local approaches. Conclusion: By avoiding intersections globally, we can reproduce key physiological features such as parallel running inflow vessels and tortuous vessels. Significance: The ability to generate non-intersecting vascular trees inside nonconvex organs can improve the functional assessment of organs.",

      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures.

      "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

      "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "title": "A correlation-based tool for quantifying membrane periodic skeleton associated periodicity",
      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",
