      "content": "Missense variants in O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) result in OGT congenital disorder of glycosylation (OGT-CDG), an intellectual disability syndrome associated with O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis and a range of neurodevelopmental defects. Inhibition of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), the enzyme responsible for removing protein O-GlcNAcylation, has been explored as a target for modulating brain O-GlcNAc homeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases and may also be a target for OGT-CDG. Here, we describe an OGT-CDG mouse line that exhibits microcephaly, motor deficits, and brain O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis, closely mirroring patient symptoms. We genetically explored OGA as a target for OGT-CDG by crossing these mice with a line carrying catalytically inactive OGA. Encouragingly, this partially restored O-GlcNAc homeostasis in brain and blood, although it did not result in significant phenotypic rescue. These findings suggest that OGA inhibition can modulate enzymatic imbalance in OGT-CDG mice, and that blood can be used to monitor the effects of interventions targeting O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis.",

      "title": "A deep convolutional neural network trained for lightness constancy is susceptible to lightness illusions",
      "content": "Human viewers are able to perform tasks that depend on accurate estimates of surface reflectance, even across large changes in illumination and context. This is a remarkable ability, and successful image-computable models of how the visual system achieves this have remained elusive. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed that are adept at estimating surface reflectance. Here we evaluated one such network as a starting point for a new model of human lightness perception by testing whether it was susceptible to a range of classic lightness illusions. We implemented a CNN and trained it via supervised learning to estimate surface reflectance at each pixel in grayscale, rendered images of geometric objects. We examined the network's output on several illusions, including the argyle, Koffka, snake, simultaneous contrast, White's, and checkerboard illusions, as well as control figures. We included variants where low-luminance regions important to the illusions were generated either by low reflectance or by cast shadows. For comparison, we carried out a lightness matching experiment with human observers using the same stimuli, and also examined the outputs of three classic lightness and brightness models. The CNN largely removed lighting effects such as shading and shadows, and produced good reflectance estimates on a test set. It also qualitatively predicted the illusions perceived by humans in most cases, the exceptions being White's and checkerboard illusions. The CNN outperformed classical models, both at estimating reflectance and at tracking human lightness matches. These findings support a normative view of lightness perception and highlight the promise of deep learning models in this area.",

      "title": "Sex-specific trajectories of gait adaptation following partial dopaminergic lesions in a rat model of parkinsons disease",
      "content": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which gait disturbances are central to disability, yet their early manifestations remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of identifying prodromal PD in humans. Rodent models may help narrow this gap by approximating partial dopaminergic loss and enabling investigation of motor changes that precede overt symptoms. Here, we examined gait dynamics in Wistar rats following unilateral, low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Animals were assessed weekly for six weeks in the horizontal ladder test, where running velocity and footfall accuracy were quantified with markerless pose estimation using DeepLabCut (DLC). Lesioned animals exhibited greater tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-reactivity asymmetry than controls, reflected behaviorally as persistent but gradually attenuating deficits in gait precision. Errors peaked at week three and remained above baseline through week six. Velocity was preserved across groups, but sex differences emerged. Control females accelerated more steeply over time, whereas lesioned females showed attenuated gains and greater variability, while males displayed more homogeneous velocity profiles across conditions. Together, these findings indicate that partial SNc lesions reveal sex-specific trajectories of motor adaptation, a feature relevant to modeling prodromal PD. Combined with DLC-based tracking, this framework offers a practical approach for detecting early behavioral markers and supporting the identification of preclinical motor features of PD.",

      "title": "Fast-conducting mechanonociceptors uniquely engage reflexive and affective pain circuitry to drive protective responses",
      "content": "Nociceptors detect damaging stimuli and evoke pain in healthy animals. We conducted an optogenetic activation screen to identify genetically defined nociceptor populations that elicit place aversion and nocifensive behaviors in response to stimulation. Smr2Cre- and Bmpr1bCre-labeled A{delta} high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) emerged as two of the few nociceptor populations, and we focused on investigating their physiological, morphological, functional, and synaptic properties. These neurons densely innervate skin and other organs, are activated only by intense, potentially damaging stimuli, and are necessary for protective responses to sharp mechanical stimuli. Centrally, A{delta}-HTMRs projections span multiple spinal segments and terminate across spinal cord laminae, forming strong, monosynaptic connections onto anterolateral tract projection neurons, including antenna cells of the deep dorsal horn. A{delta}-HTMRs also engage a local spinal reflex circuit enabling a remarkably rapid limb withdrawal. Thus, A{delta}-HTMRs are myelinated nociceptors with unique properties that can be exploited for development of new analgesics.",

      "title": "Neural dynamics of covert habit activation and control in humans",
      "content": "The neuroscience of habits in humans presumes a winner-takes-all contest between two systems: stimulus-response and goal-directed. But lacking strong causal manipulations for inducing habits in humans, researchers have struggled to understand the brain mechanisms supporting the development of stimulus-response associations over time and their interaction with goal-directed processes. To address this, we conducted a preregistered 14-day within-subject electroencephalography (EEG) study and used tight temporal controls to isolate the functioning of each system. We found both causal and correlational evidence that the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) can serve as a covert neural signature for habits, detectable on trials where inappropriate habits are overcome and behavior is classed as goal-directed. We found evidence that stronger habits required more frontal midline theta (FM{theta}) power to successfully inhibit them, supporting the view that the goal-directed system competes with stimulus-response representations. These data showcase the hidden role of multiple brain systems in habit expression and provide a new window into the formation and override of habits.",

      "title": "Sample size critically shapes the reliability of EEG case-control findings in psychiatry",
      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) studies in psychiatry have produced highly inconsistent findings, particularly in case-control designs. Small sample sizes are widely assumed to contribute to this variability, yet their impact on the reliability of EEG group comparisons has not been systematically quantified at scale. Here, we address this key gap using a large multisite resting-state EEG dataset comprising 2,874 participants aged 5-18 years, including individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, learning disorders, and healthy controls. We extracted a comprehensive set of spectral, temporal, and complexity EEG features and performed repeated case-control comparisons across a wide range of sample sizes using extensive random subsampling. Results from small samples were unstable, with inflated and highly variable effect sizes across iterations. By contrast, larger samples produced consistent and reproducible findings, converging on uniformly small but robust effects. Statistical power rose steeply with sample size, whereas false positive rates remained relatively stable. These results demonstrate the central role of sample size in shaping EEG study outcomes and challenge the utility of conventional case-control approaches for biomarker discovery in psychiatry.",

      "title": "Continuous theta-burst stimulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex reduces Pavlovian go-invigoration and enhances thalamo-striatal reward prediction error signals",
      "content": "The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value, i.e. whether environmental cues are good or bad. Rewarding cue value is aligned with a tendency to act or to inhibit in case of potential punishment, a so-called Pavlovian Bias. Value-related vmPFC activation may therefore impact Pavlovian bias. However, it remains unknown how the activity in the vmPFC modulates the Pavlovian bias. Thus, we applied continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive protocol that transiently reduces cortical excitability, over the vmPFC in a single-blinded, between-subject study. 90 healthy adults performed a motivational Go/NoGo learning task during fMRI after receiving cTBS (n=45) or sham (n=45) stimulation. Behaviourally, cTBS reduced overall Go response rates and slowed reaction times. Computational modelling showed a decrease in the learning rate, selectively for rewarding outcomes. Computational fMRI analysis showed stronger reward prediction error (RPE) signals in the vmPFC, mediodorsal thalamus, and left dorsal striatum after cTBS, without changes in neural signals at cue onset. These findings provide causal evidence that the vmPFC drives the action-invigoration component of the Pavlovian bias.",

      "title": "Minute- and second-scale hippocampal network dysfunctions in the 3xTgAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease are prevented by TSPO knockout",
      "content": "The 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is widely recognized as a biomarker of neuroinflammation, but recent evidence suggests that it may also play a direct role in the pathophysiology of neurological conditions with an inflammatory component such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we leveraged functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) to assess how TSPO knockout influences brain activity and connectivity in the 3xTgAD mouse model of AD. Resting-state scans were performed in 16-month-old male and female mice across four genotypes: WT, TSPO-/-, 3xTgAD or 3xTgAD.TSPO-/-. Using a data-driven approach, we identified key functional networks, including a bilateral hippocampal-amygdala limbic network. Dual regression analysis revealed increased engagement of the ventral hippocampus within the limbic network and elevated hemodynamic variance in 3xTgAD mice compared to WT. Moreover, co-activation patterns (CAPs) analysis showed abnormal activation/deactivation cycles involving the dorsal hippocampus, both of which were prevented by TSPO knockout without affecting amyloid or tau burden. Our findings highlight a functional role for TSPO in shaping network dynamics and suggest that its deletion can mitigate brain dysfunction in AD models.",

      "title": "Locally balanced inhibition allows for robust learning of input-output associations in feedforward networks with Hebbian plasticity",
      "content": "In neural networks within the brain, the activity of a post-synaptic neuron is determined by the combined influence of many pre-synaptic neurons. This distributed processing enables mechanisms like Hebbian plasticity to associate sensory inputs with specific internal states, as seen in feedforward structures such as the CA1 region of the hippocampus. By modifying synaptic weights through Hebbian rules, sensory inputs can subsequently elicit outputs that consistently reflect their corresponding internal states. When input and output patterns are uncorrelated, this approach allows for the encoding of a large number of distinct associations, enabling efficient memory storage. Our study demonstrates a critical limitation when output patterns become weakly correlated with input patterns through the intrinsic feedforward network's connectivity. In these cases, the Hebbian rule preferentially strengthens synaptic weights shared across patterns, leading to a \"freezing\" of the network's structure. This results in highly correlated output patterns over time, effectively reducing the network's capacity to store diverse associations and limiting its flexibility in learning. To address this challenge, we find that including a mechanism of locally balanced inhibition, which has been shown to be a key feature of cortical circuits in-vivo, counteracts the undesired correlations between inputs and outputs. By dynamically regulating inhibitory input, locally balanced inhibition prevents the over-strengthening of shared weights, restoring the network's ability to maintain robust and flexible learning. This finding underscores the importance of inhibitory mechanisms in enabling efficient and adaptive information processing in neural circuits, offering insights into how biological networks maintain their remarkable capacity for associative learning.",

      "title": "Eye-hand coordination beyond vision: preceding gaze history shapes reaching memories",
      "content": "Skilled reaching behaviors, such as grasping a cup or catching a ball, require adaptive changes in response to error signals. Our natural reaches are usually coordinated with preceding eye movements. Despite this behavioral relevance, the potential linkage between preceding eye movements and memory formation for reaching has been largely overlooked. We show that two opposing visuomotor maps for reach, which normally prevent learning due to interference, can be learned when each is associated with a different immediately preceding eye movement. We further show that the generalization pattern of reach learning across different gaze conditions can be explained by the gaze state's distance computed with temporal weighting. These findings indicate that reaching memories are encoded in tight association with the recent history of preceding gaze states. Our results expand the functional role of eye-hand coordination beyond visual guidance, revealing its importance in orchestrating flexible motor learning.",
