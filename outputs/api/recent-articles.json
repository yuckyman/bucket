      "title": "Blood-derived dietary protein promotes sleep in the mosquito Aedes aegypti",
      "content": "Sleep is a ubiquitous, yet highly variable, behavior across species. The duration and timing of sleep are influenced by ecological demands and dietary context. In the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a blood feeding insect with specialized nutritional requirements, the relationship between feeding and sleep remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate how blood derived dietary protein influences sleep regulation. Using postural analysis, videography, and arousal threshold assays, we establish that immobility bouts of greater than 10 minutes reliably define sleep in Ae. aegypti. Infrared activity monitoring revealed that blood-fed females exhibit a marked increase in sleep beginning immediately after feeding and persisting for several days, accompanied by reduced locomotor activity. Notably, this sleep elevation lasts well beyond the cessation of host-seeking behavior, suggesting distinct phases of opportunistic versus determined host pursuit. To determine the dietary basis of this effect, we tested mosquitoes fed a bovine serum albumin (BSA) based diet. BSA feeding alone was sufficient to mimic the sleep-promoting and hypoactive effects of blood, identifying dietary protein as the key nutritional regulator. Moreover, RNAi mediated knockdown of the leucokinin receptor (lkr), previously implicated in fluid regulation and feeding, enhanced sleep and reduced activity, implicating LK signaling in postprandial sleep modulation. Together, these findings demonstrate that blood-derived proteins drive sustained increases in sleep and reduced locomotion in Ae. aegypti. This work positions Ae. aegypti as a model for dissecting nutrient-specific regulation of sleep and highlights potential adaptive functions of protein-induced quiescence, such as energy conservation and predator avoidance. More broadly, it provides insight into how specialized diets shape the neural and behavioral architecture of sleep.",

Current family planning interventions should target women with sensory disabilities by prioritising accessible communication methods (e.g., braille, sign language), disability awareness training for healthcare workers, and integration of reproductive health services into disability support programmes.",

      "content": "High-resolution electronic tactile displays stand to transform haptics for remote machine operation, virtual reality, and digital information access for people who are blind or visually impaired. Yet, increasing the resolution of these displays requires increasing the number of individually addressable actuators while simultaneously reducing their total surface area, power consumption, and weight, challenges most evidently reflected in the dearth of affordable multiline braille displays....",

      "content": "Electronic skins (e-skins) incorporating island architectures represent a promising platform for strain-insensitive tactile sensing by mechanically decoupling sensing units from deformations. However, conventional island designs encounter stress concentration issues caused by inherent modulus mismatches, critically limiting achievable island densities. This limitation forces a stubborn trade-off between strain-insensitivity and sensing resolution. Here, inspired by the entangled elastin networks...",

However, conventional tactile sensor arrays face inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, sensitivity, and crosstalk suppression due to microstructure size limitations and signal interference. To address this, we developed a tactile sensor featuring 10 \u03bcm-scale pyramid tips that achieve ultra-high sensitivity (8.082 kPa^(-1) in 0.2-0.5 kPa range). By integrating a...",

For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",
