      "title": "Caveolin-1 controls lineage fidelity of adult neural stem cells via lysosomal degradation of PDGFR\u03b1",
      "content": "Caveolae are cell-surface signaling hubs involved in stem cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the molecular details of how they influence stem cell quiescence remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that most caveolae components, particularly caveolin-1 (Cav-1), are specifically upregulated in quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cav-1 restricts platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)  signaling, a key regulator for NSC proliferation and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the adult brain, through lysosomal degradation. Genetic ablation of Cav-1 leads to aberrant NSC activation, reduced neurogenesis, and enhanced ectopic oligodendrocyte differentiation on the ventricular surface in the ventral side of the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), a key NSC niche responsible for neuroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that Cav-1 deficiency suppresses the endo-lysosomal degradation of PDGFR, leading to PDGFR accumulation and excessive signaling for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Taken together, our results uncover a crucial homeostatic mechanism wherein caveolae function as a safeguard to maintain adult NSC quiescence and lineage fidelity by controlling lysosomal turnover of PDGFR in a niche-specific manner.",

      "title": "Hippocampal cell- and circuit-specific differences in mitochondrial form and function",
      "content": "Mitochondrial morphology varies by neuronal cell type and subcellular compartment; however, the functional significance of these differences is unclear. Hippocampal CA2 neurons are enriched for genes encoding mitochondrial proteins compared to CA1 neurons, suggesting a difference in metabolic demand across hippocampal circuits. However, whether CA2 neuron mitochondria are structurally or functionally distinct to support circuit-specific energy demands is unknown. Here we compared mitochondrial morphology, protein expression, and calcium levels across CA1 and CA2 circuits. We found mitochondria in CA2 dendrites were larger than mitochondria in CA1 dendrites. However, both subregions harbored larger mitochondria in the entorhinal cortex (EC)-contacting distal dendrites compared to CA3-contacting proximal dendrites. Together, these data demonstrate both cell type- and input specific regulation of mitochondrial morphology that likely influences the function of these distinct circuits. To determine whether differences in mitochondrial fission or fusion account for cell and/or layer specific differences in morphology, we immunostained for OPA1 and MFF, which showed a general enrichment in distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and an unexpected increase in CA1 distal dendrites compared to CA2 distal dendrites. To show whether these morphological differences result in functionally distinct mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial calcium levels in live slices. We found a striking enrichment of mitochondrial calcium levels in CA2 distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and this layer-specific effect was significantly different from that in CA1 dendrites at baseline and after activity. Collectively, these findings reveal discrete morphological and functional differences in mitochondria across hippocampal subregions and dendritic layers, which likely confer unique circuit properties and/or vulnerabilities to disease.",

      "title": "BAG3 modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis and tau uptake in astrocytes",
      "content": "In a healthy brain, astrocytes maintain neuronal homeostasis by removing proteins like tau from the extracellular space, preventing their uptake by neurons. In Alzheimer disease (AD), this function is impaired, contributing to tau accumulation. Many AD risk genes are linked to endocytosis pathways, suggesting their role in AD pathogenesis. Astrocytes can internalize, degrade, and release tau, but the mechanisms remain unclear. BAG3, a multifunctional protein, regulates vacuolar processes and interacts with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) components. However, its role in astrocytic CME and tau processing is not fully understood. We show BAG3 depletion in astrocytes reduces clathrin-AP-2 interaction, inhibits CME-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor internalization, and decreases tau uptake. Live-cell imaging reveals BAG3 depletion impairs CME dynamics, increasing clathrin particle lifetimes. BAG3 depletion also alters endolysosomal compartments, increasing Lamp1+ puncta and tau co-localization. These findings highlight BAG3s role in CME, tau trafficking, and vacuolar processes, suggesting its dysfunction may contribute to AD pathogenesis.",

      "content": "IntroductionIn this study, we propose a data-driven approach that integrates behavioral diagnosis with neuroimaging features to identify representative UWS and MCS patients from a large inpatient cohort.MethodsClinical information was extracted using a subset of UWS patients with CRS-R scores \u2264 5. Neuroimaging biomarkers were established as the increased and decreased functional connectivity indices of anatomically defined regions covering the whole brain. The algorithm was implemented through an iterative refinement process that converged on a division of UWS and MCS patients into representative and excluded (or nonrepresentative) patient groups.ResultsThirty-one out of 58 UWS patients and 23 out of 30 MCS patients were identified as representative, with an average classification accuracy of 90.2% in differentiating between the two groups. In contrast, differentiating between excluded UWS patients (n =\u202f27) and representative MCS patients (n =\u202f23) and between all UWS (n =\u202f58) and MCS (n =\u202f30) patients produced average classification accuracies of 50.9 and 64.3%, respectively. Furthermore, altered DMN functional connectivity between representative UWS and MCS patients revealed a consistent pattern as shown in prior studies, while comparisons involving excluded patients did not.DiscussionThese results highlight the value of integrating behavioral scores and neural connectivity features for DOC classification, providing a more coherent basis for downstream analysis and machine-learning applications in DOC classification.",

      "content": "BackgroundRetroclival subdural hematoma (rcSDH) secondary to spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is an exceedingly rare clinical entity, characterized by complex and incompletely understood pathophysiological mechanisms.CaseA 24-year-old female presented with acute and persistent orthostatic headache, with no history of trauma or anticoagulant therapy. Neuroimaging revealed subdural hematomas (SDH) located in the retroclival, infratentorial, and right frontal regions. It was hypothesized that veinous rupture, resulting from venous traction due to decreased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, was the underlying mechanism. Following epidural blood patch (EBP) therapy, the patient exhibited marked symptomatic improvement and radiological resolution of hematomas on follow-up imaging.ConclusionRcSDH is considered an uncommon complication of SIH, potentially resulting from venous rupture in the retroclival subdural space due to reduced CSF pressure. SIH should be considered in cases of rcSDH. The treatment is typically focused on addressing the underlying etiology, with early diagnosis and timely intervention being essential for achieving favorable outcomes. In cases of severe brainstem compression, hematoma evacuation should be performed in conjunction with EBP.",

      "title": "Skull stripping tools in pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans: a retrospective evaluation of segmentation performance",
      "content": "IntroductionFor brain maturity assessment of infants aged above 6 months, T2-weighted MRI scans are recommended. Prior to automated brain tissue analysis, skull stripping is typically applied. However, most skull stripping tools neither focus on T2-weighted scans nor on pediatric cohorts. Here, we present the evaluation results of seven common skull stripping tools in a comparably large pediatric cohort.MethodsThis study is based on 199 T2-weighted scans of children under the age of 5 years retrospectively acquired from the clinical routine at Hannover Medical School. We established a manually labeled ground truth under quality control of a senior neuroradiologist specialized in pediatric neuroradiology and evaluated seven skull stripping tools (BET, ROBEX, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast, SynthStrip, SynthStrip-noCSF and d-SynthStrip). Segmentation performance (Dice score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, specificity) and computation time were assessed on non-preprocessed and preprocessed scans (zero padding, contrast enhancement, artifact removal and normalization) as well as in different brain regions. For the best performing model, we manually assessed the top and bottom quartile of segmentations with respect to the integrity of different anatomical brain structures.ResultsOnly BET, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast profited from data preprocessing. Considering this, all models had median Dice scores between 0.88 and 0.96, with SynthStrip performing best. All models segmented most accurately in the middle axial slices of the brain. Resampling lowered the performance of all models, except ROBEX. Mean computing times ranged from 2\u202fs (BET) to 132\u202fs (HD-BET) with SynthStrip requiring 7\u202fs. per scan. SynthStrip was prone to not entirely including the Sinus sagittalis superior, the upper Cerebrum, the temporal pole, the Cerebellum and the Chiasma opticum/pituitary gland. In contrast, the petrous bone and the skull in the middle axial slices have often been partly included.DiscussionDue to its robustness and quick computation time, we recommend SynthStrip for skull stripping of pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans. We attribute the observed segmentation errors to the partial volume effect, which should be addressed in future research. Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting, the exclusion of pathological cases and the skewed age distribution in our cohort.",

      "title": "Strengthening interhemispheric connectivity increases interregional information transfer between human primary motor areas",
      "content": "Communication between brain regions is thought to be supported by the temporal alignment of their oscillatory activity creating rhythmic windows of opportunity for efficient information transfer. We examined this possibility by manipulating the strength of coupling between the left primary motor cortex (lM1) and the right primary motor cortex (rM1) and examined the impact on activity transfer between the two areas measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 60 right-handed individuals. In three experiments we manipulated the strength of the pathway connecting the lM1 and rM1 by applying paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) using three different patterns, two of which increase interregional coupling strength. We measured the impact on EEG communication transfer in the alpha, beta, and theta bands at rest. Augmenting the strength of the lM1-to-rM1 pathway enhanced the interregional communication volume in the high-theta/low alpha band, and both volume and speed in the beta band, respectively. These changes, visible at rest, are related to changes in the transcallosal inhibitory influence of the lM1 over rM1 cortical excitability following ccPAS. By contrast, augmenting the rM1-to-lM1 route failed to modulate communication transfer in right-handed individuals. The results provide direct evidence of oscillatory intra-areal information transfer, demonstrating a link between motor network physiology and the resonant frequencies mediating its interactions.",

      "title": "The Sweet Spot of Plasticity in Perceptual Learning Dependson Training Variability",
      "content": "Perceptual learning improves sensory discrimination, yet the brain must balance specificity and generalization, especially in variable environments. To investigate how variability shapes perceptual learning, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects performed an orientation discrimination task with low or high task-irrelevant variability in spatial frequency. Behaviorally, both training regimes improved performance, but only high variability training enabled transfer to a novel location. Retinotopic orientation representations in early visual areas changed similarly across groups, indicating that variability does not alter local sensory representations. In contrast, functional connectivity differed: low variability training enhanced task-dependent coupling between the intraparietal sulcus and V2, while high variability training differentially affected connectivity with hV4. These results support a \"sweet spot\" model of perceptual learning, in which the locus of learning flexibly depends on the training environment. But rather than modifying sensory representations, variability reconfigures network-level readout, enabling specific or generalizable improvements in perception.",

      "title": "A Concept-Driven Disentanglement Framework for Interpretable Graph Neural Networks in Structure-Function Coupling",
      "content": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting brain functional connectivity (FC) from structural connectivity (SC), yet their \"black-box\" nature limits interpretability and scientific utility. We present a concept-driven disentanglement framework that builds inherently interpretable GNNs for quantitative hypothesis testing of structure-function relationships. The framework employs an ensemble of GNN branches, each architecturally biased to learn from a predefined structural concept (e.g., strong vs. weak connections) by processing a filtered version of the SC graph. This design enforces verifiably disentangled node embeddings, ensuring each branch captures a distinct structural feature. Using SHAP (Shapley additive explanations), we quantify the predictive contribution of each concept and assess its statistical significance against null distributions. Our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for FC, achieving a group-level correlation coefficient of 0.91 on a public human connectome dataset, while simultaneously yielding interpretable neuroscientific insights. This interpretable-by-design methodology bridges the gap between predictive power and scientific transparency, enabling deep learning models to provide mechanistic insights into the brain's network organization.",
