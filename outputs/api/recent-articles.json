      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

      "title": "Rethinking the Simulation vs. Rendering Dichotomy: No Free Lunch in Spatial World Modelling",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.20835v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Spatial world models, representations that support flexible reasoning about spatial relations, are central to developing computational models that could operate in the physical world, but their precise mechanistic underpinnings are nuanced by the borrowing of underspecified or misguided accounts of human cognition. This paper revisits the simulation versus rendering dichotomy and draws on evidence from aphantasia to argue that fine-grained perceptual content is critical for model-based spatial reasoning. Drawing on recent research into the neural basis of visual awareness, we propose that spatial simulation and perceptual experience depend on shared representational geometries captured by higher-order indices of perceptual relations. We argue that recent developments in embodied AI support this claim, where rich perceptual details improve performance on physics-based world engagements. To this end, we call for the development of architectures capable of maintaining structured perceptual representations as a step toward spatial world modelling in AI.",

      "title": "BACE: Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation for Interpretable Graphs of Neural Dynamics",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.20831v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding how distributed brain regions coordinate to produce behavior requires models that are both predictive and interpretable. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Connectivity Estimation (BACE), an end-to-end framework that learns phase-specific, directed inter-regional connectivity directly from multi-region intracranial local field potentials (LFP). BACE aggregates many micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines. Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for each within-trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase-specific graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions during behavior.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of transitions between internal and external cognitive domains",
      "content": "Human cognition involves continuous transitions between processing information guided by the external world and engaging with internally-generated thoughts, yet research has predominantly investigated switching based on external rules. We therefore examined neural mechanisms underlying external and internal domain switching using independent groups of EEG (N=46) and fMRI (N=60) in a colour judgement task requiring evaluations based on either colour similarity (external domain) or colour preference (internal domain) through switching on a trial-by-trial basis. ERPs revealed amplitude differences between the two judgements as well as switching and repeated trials. EEG analysis revealed a sustained neural differentiation between switch and repeated trials, specifically during similarity judgments, with effects lasting from early time points through the entire trial duration. fMRI showed similarity judgements engaged visual and motor regions during switching, while preference judgements showed minimal subcortical activation for repeated trials. These findings demonstrate that external and internal cognitive domain switching effects are asymmetrical. These findings provide the first temporal and spatial neural characterisation of domain switching between processing information guided by the external world and internally-generated thoughts, indicating that shifting between internal and external domains involves mechanisms distinct from traditional external rule-switching paradigms.",

      "title": "A neurophysiological alignment metric reveals a supportive role of unexpected stimuli in naturalistic language comprehension",
      "content": "Individuals use language every day to communicate their thoughts, emotions and expectations to those around them. Communication also incorporates receiving continuous and complex streams of information, not all of which is easily predictable. The memory literature suggests that this unexpected information may be processed more effectively when an individual possesses an adequate schema of the local context. We propose that, in language comprehension, we can determine the presence of a relevant scheme via an alignment metric, which compares an individual's brain response to language (N400 amplitudes) with an expected response as determined by the probabilistic contingencies of the current context (surprisal). When alignment is higher, an individual's internal model of the world is assumed to closely mirror the environment, constituting an effective schema. The present study sought to explore how individuals process unexpected information and whether successful comprehension is related to the alignment of internal predictive models to the external environment. It was hypothesised that higher alignment would support better comprehension of unexpected information than lower alignment. 40 participants (27F; mean age: 24.6 years; SD: 5.94) listened to 12 short stories (3 genres, audio presentation) while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Comprehension was tested via 6 multiple choice questions per story. A comprehension linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was computed for two regions of interest and two predictability metrics (N400 amplitudes and surprisal). A functional role of unexpectedness was demonstrated in all four models, where greater unexpectedness was related to higher comprehension scores. In one model we observed a significant interaction between alignment and average N400 amplitudes, indicating that comprehension was better for more unexpected stories when there was lower alignment to expected contextual probabilities. Our results suggest that individuals can utilise unexpected information to support language comprehension and that there are conditions where successful integration of this information is more likely. Contrary to our expectations, lower alignment to the current probabilistic conditions led to a greater capacity to utilise unexpected information. Future research should explore whether lower alignment reflects an individual's openness to integrate new information into existing schemas and how this impacts comprehension of unexpected language.",

      "content": "Learning and memory arise from synaptic plasticity, the ability of neurons to modify connectivity through experience-dependent changes in receptor localisation and signalling. Here, we identify a short intracellular motif within the serotonin-gated ion channel LGC-50 that links molecular receptor dynamics to behavioural plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Deletion of residues 363-379 in the intracellular M3-4 loop caused receptor clustering in intracellular compartments and abolished learning-induced redistribution without altering receptor function or immediate memory recall. Interestingly, animals expressing the truncated receptor failed to retrieve aversive memories one hour after training, revealing a role for receptor trafficking in memory stability. Combining molecular, ultrastructural and behavioural analyses in vivo, we show how intracellular receptor motifs govern experience-dependent plasticity. These findings demonstrate that precise receptor localisation and trafficking shape neural circuit adaptation and reveal a conserved mechanism by which receptor dynamics support the persistence and retrieval of memory across species.",

      "content": "Social recognition requires linking information about others to the spatial contexts in which they are encountered, a computation thought to engage the hippocampus. Although this process depends on coordinated activity across the hippocampal network, how specific subfields differentially contribute to social recognition remains unclear. Here, we performed one-photon calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to record endogenous activity from the intermediate CA1 (iCA1) and the intermediate CA3 (iCA3) during a novel behavioral paradigm that disentangles social identity from spatial position. Neurons in both subfields encoded social and spatial variables, but iCA3 neurons more robustly discriminated between novel and familiar conspecifics, suggesting that iCA3 neurons more strongly encoded social novelty than those in the iCA1. In contrast, iCA1 neurons more robustly encoded spatial position, indicating distinct roles for these subfields in processing social-context sensitive information. Longitudinal tracking further revealed that social representations remapped across days in both subfields, whereas spatial representations remained stable. These results identify the iCA3 as a key locus for social novelty encoding and suggest a functional division of labor within the hippocampus, in which stable spatial frameworks in the iCA1 anchor flexible, context-dependent social representations in the iCA3 that support adaptive social memory.",

      "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used.

      "title": "Postural sway in multiple sclerosis patients: interaction of vision, surface, and fatigue effects",
      "content": "IntroductionPostural control impairments are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), resulting in postural instability and increased fall risk. Sensory inputs are crucial to maintain balance adequately. Additionally, fatigue is one of the common and most disabling symptoms of MS, possibly contributing to postural deficits. Previous studies have examined the effects of fatigue and altered sensory conditions on postural control in patients with MS. The present study aimed to extend this knowledge by jointly assessing these factors within the same experimental framework, providing additional insight into how fatigue modulates sensory contributions to balance.MethodsA total of 21 patients with MS (age\u202f=\u202f41.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f10.1\u202fyears; EDSS\u202f=\u202f1.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.0; disease duration\u202f=\u202f6.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.9\u202fyears) completed balance assessments on firm and compliant surfaces with both eyes open and eyes closed, before and after a 6-min walk test used to induce fatigue. Postural sway was quantified using sway velocity and root mean square (RMS).ResultsThere was a significant effect of surface on sway velocity (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.60), with a greater sway on the compliant surface compared to the firm surface. Fatigue significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.023, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.23) but did not affect sway velocity (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). The absence of visual input (eyes closed) also significantly increased sway RMS (p\u202f=\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.46). There was a significant interaction between surface and vision for sway RMS (p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b72\u202f=\u202f0.54), with a larger effect of surface instability in the eyes-closed condition.DiscussionPatients with MS face increased challenges in maintaining postural control under conditions of fatigue, surface instability, and lack of visual input. Sway RMS may be more sensitive to these effects than sway velocity.",

      "content": "BackgroundInner speech\u2014the covert articulation of words in one\u2019s mind\u2014is a fundamental phenomenon in human cognition with growing interest across BCI. This pilot study evaluates and compares deep learning models for inner-speech classification using non-invasive EEG derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset (4 participants, 8 words). The study assesses a compact CNN (EEGNet) and a spectro-temporal Transformer using leave-one-subject-out validation, reporting accuracy. Macro-F1, precision, and recall.ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate and compare deep learning models for inner speech classification using non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) data, derived from a bimodal EEG-fMRI dataset. The goal is to assess the performance and generalizability of two architectures: the compact convolutional EEGNet and a novel spectro-temporal Transformer.MethodsData were obtained from four healthy participants who performed structured inner speech tasks involving eight target words. EEG signals were preprocessed and segmented into epochs for each imagined word. EEGNet and Transformer models were trained using a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation strategy. Performance metrics included accuracy, macro-averaged F1 score, precision, and recall. An ablation study examined the contribution of Transformer components, including wavelet decomposition and self-attention mechanisms.ResultsThe spectro-temporal Transformer achieved the highest classification accuracy (82.4%) and macro-F1 score (0.70), outperforming both the standard and improved EEGNet models. Discriminative power was also substantially improved by using wavelet-based time-frequency features and attention mechanisms. Results showed that confusion patterns of social word categories outperformed those of number concepts, corresponding to different mental processing strategies.ConclusionDeep learning models, in particular attention-based Transformers, demonstrate great promise in decoding internal speech from EEG. These findings lay the groundwork for non-invasive, real-time BCIs for communication rehabilitation in severely disabled patients. Future work will take into account vocabulary expansion, wider participant variety, and real-time validation in clinical settings.",

      "title": "Clinical study of wearable low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment in the improvement of executive function in obesity (the SLITE trial): protocol for a single -centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "IntroductionObesity is a global health crisis associated with significant physical and cognitive impairments, particularly in executive function. Impaired executive function exacerbates unhealthy eating behaviors and hinders effective weight management. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques like transcranial direct current stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation have demonstrated potential in improving executive function and assisting in weight reduction but face limitations in accessibility and efficacy. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) represents an emerging neuromodulation technique distinguished by its non-invasive application and superior spatial resolution, facilitating targeted modulation of cortical activity and neural excitability with high precision. This study aims to explore the efficacy of LIPUS on executive function in obesity.Methods and analysisThis study adopts a prospective, single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled design. A total of 44 participants diagnosed with obesity (BMI \u2265 28 kg/m2) will be enrolled and equally assigned to the LIPUS and sham groups. The LIPUS group will receive pulsed therapeutic ultrasound for 4 weeks, while the sham group will receive placebo treatment using a device delivering no therapeutic ultrasound. Both groups will undergo assessments at baseline and after 4 weeks, with the primary outcome being the change in reaction time on the food Go/No-go task. Secondary outcomes include changes in body weight, BMI, food cravings (measured by the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait and State versions), food-eating behavior (measured by the Visual Analog Scale and the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire), and cognitive performance as assessed by the Stroop test. Additional neuroimaging assessments will include functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG).DiscussionThis trial will be the first to evaluate LIPUS for enhancing executive function in individuals with obesity. By combining wearable ultrasound technology with neuroimaging assessments, the study is expected to provide novel evidence for the neuromodulatory role of LIPUS. The results may support the development of innovative, non-invasive strategies for obesity management and inform future clinical applications.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Chronic pain affects up to 60% of the population and not only impairs physical function but also leads to multidimensional neurocognitive deficits, including diminished attention, working memory impairment, and executive dysfunction. Clinical studies indicate that chronic pain induces gray matter atrophy in key brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, along with disrupted functional connectivity and other pathological alterations. Despite extensive research, the precise pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unclear, making this a central focus of current investigations. In this review, we examine the morphological and functional changes in these critical brain regions from an anatomical perspective. By integrating cellular and molecular insights, we elucidate the multi-level mechanisms underlying chronic pain-induced cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we summarize current therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological treatments, neuromodulation, and behavioral interventions, and discuss promising directions for future research. By synthesizing recent advances, this review aims to enhance understanding of the clinical manifestations and pathophysiology of chronic pain, thereby informing the development of more effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",
