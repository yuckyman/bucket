      "content": "<p>Hello all!<p>I've been an avid fan of Pocket Operators by Teenage Engineering since I found out about them. I even own an EP-133 K.O. II today, which I love.<p>A couple of months ago, Reddit user andiam03 shared a Google Sheet with some drum patterns [1]. I thought it was a very cool way to share and understand beats.<p>During the weekend I coded a basic version of this app I am sharing today. I iterated over it in my free time, and yesterday I felt like I had a pretty good version to share with y'all.<p>It's not meant to be a sequencer but rather a way to experiment with beats and basic sounds, save them, and use them in your songs. It also has a sharing feature with a link.<p>It was built using Tone.js [2], Stimulus [3] and deployed in Render [4] as a static website. I used an LLM to read the Tone.js documentation and generate sounds, since I have no knowledge about sound production, and modified from there.<p>Anyway, hope you like it! I had a blast building it.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https://teenage.engineering\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://teenage.engineering</a><p>[1]: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soeVaY7iUSj1YncfIJZIPScBhM/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GMRWxEqcZGdBzJg52soe...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https://tonejs.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://tonejs.github.io</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https://stimulus.hotwired.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://stimulus.hotwired.dev</a><p>[4]: <a href=\"http://render.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://render.com</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672181\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46672181</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "title": "The impact of dynamic reversal potential on the evolution of action potential attributes during spike trains",
      "content": "Action potentials (AP) are the basic elements of information processing in the nervous system. Understanding AP generation mechanisms is a critical step to understand how neurons encode information. However, an individual neuron might fire APs with various shapes even in response to the same stimulus, and the mechanisms responsible for this variability remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed four AP attributes including AP rapidity and threshold during consecutive bursts from three neuron types using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. In response to consecutive current steps, the AP attributes in evoked spike trains show two distinctive patterns across different neurons: (1) The first APs from each train always have comparable properties regardless of the stimulus strength; (2) The attributes of the subsequent APs during each pulse monotonically change during the burst, where the magnitude of AP attribute change during each pulse increases with increasing stimulation strength. Various conductance-based models were explored to determine if they replicated the observed AP bursts. The observed patterns could not be replicated using the classical HH-type models, or modified HH model with cooperative Na+ gating. However, adding ion concentration dynamics to the model reproduced the AP attribute variation, and the magnitude of change during a pulse correlated with change in dynamic reversal potential (DRP), but failed to replicate the first AP attributes pattern. Then, the role of cooperative Na+ gating on neuronal firing dynamics was investigated. Inclusion of cooperative gating restored the first APs\u2019 attributes and enhanced the magnitude of modeled variation of some AP attributes to better agree with observed data. We conclude that changes in local ion concentrations could be responsible for the monotonic change in APs attributes during neuronal bursts, and cooperative gating of Na+ channels can enhance the effect. Thus, the two mechanisms could contribute to the observed variability in neuronal response.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "title": "AMANet: a data-augmented multi-scale temporal attention convolutional network for motor imagery classification",
      "content": "Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interface (MI-BCI) has garnered considerable attention due to its potential for neural plasticity. However, the limited number of MI-EEG samples per subject and the susceptibility of features to noise and artifacts posed significant challenges for achieving high decoding performance. To address this problem, a Data-Augmented Multi-Scale Temporal Attention Convolutional Network (AMANet) was proposed. The network mainly consisted of four modules. First, the data augmentation module comprises three steps: sliding-window segmentation to increase sample size, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extraction of discriminative spatial features, and linear scaling to enhance network robustness. Then, multi-scale temporal convolution was incorporated to dynamically extract temporal and spatial features. Subsequently, the ECA attention mechanism was integrated to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weights of different channels. Finally, depthwise separable convolution was utilized to fully integrate and classify the deep extraction of temporal and spatial features. In 10-fold cross-validation, the results show that AMANet achieves classification accuracies of 84.06 and 85.09% on the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, respectively, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Incep-EEGNet. On the High-Gamma dataset, AMANet attains a classification accuracy of 95.48%. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of AMANet in motor imagery decoding tasks.",

      "title": "Methodological optimization for eliciting robust median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials for realtime single trial applications",
      "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",
