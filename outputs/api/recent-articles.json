      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "content": "Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis, which is crucial for membrane biosynthesis. Here we show an early requirement for Scd1 in oligodendroglial cells during developmental myelination. Using oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) specific conditional knockout model of Scd1, we observed a myelination delay during CNS development. Genetic ablation of OPC-specific Scd1 resulted in oligodendrocyte maturation delay and hypomyelination within forebrain white matter tracts and optic nerve. Interestingly, although expressed at high levels within the mature oligodendrocytes, Scd1 was dispensable in maintenance of oligodendrocytes and axonal myelination, as loss of mature oligodendrocyte specific Scd1 showed no effect on myelin maintenance or oligodendrocyte survival. Together, our results suggest that Scd1 function is temporally restricted to the developmental period when oligodendrocytes undergo differentiation and active myelination but becomes dispensable for maintaining established myelin.",

      "title": "Resting-State fMRI and the Risk of Overinterpretation: Noise, Mechanisms, and a Missing Rosetta Stone",
      "content": "Resting-state fMRI is widely used to describe spontaneous neural activity via correlation-based synchronization measures, yet it faces two fundamental obstacles: pervasive non-neural noise and the absence of a definitive \"Rosetta Stone\" linking the measured BOLD signals to underlying neural events. Although \"correlation does not imply causation\" has become a cliche, leveraging correlations effectively--and understanding their inferential pitfalls--remains a nuanced challenge. Correlation-based analyses are typically not able to yield causal conclusions, yet they are frequently used to underpin causal narratives in neuroscience research and especially in clinical contexts, which represent a problematic case of overinterpretation. Using causal inference reasoning, simulations and analytic methods, we address three critical questions when performing resting-state fMRI: (1) How reliable are correlation estimates for capturing cross-regional synchrony? (2) What are the consequences of inaccuracies in estimated correlations? (3) To what extent do estimated correlations reflect causal neural interactions? We identify two principal pitfalls. First, correlation estimates are systematically distorted by diverse noise sources, including variability in neurovascular coupling, which can generate spurious, suppressed, or even reversed effects. Second, graph-based approaches lack causal interpretability, meaning that even large samples and strong statistical evidence may obscure fundamental ambiguities in what the correlations represent. In light of these challenges, we advocate for three priorities: (1) cautious interpretation that avoids causal overreach, (2) multimodal validation to cross-check findings against independent measures, and (3) enhanced methodological rigor, particularly in biomarker discovery and clinical trials, to ensure that resting-state fMRI provides meaningful insights.",

      "title": "Flight training and alterations in cortical characteristics",
      "content": "BackgroundPiloting is a highly specialized profession. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of longitudinal flight training on the cortical characteristics of the brain.MethodsMagnetic resonance imaging of 25 flight cadets and 24 controls was performed twice over a 2-year period. The gray matter thickness, cortical surface area and sulcal depth of the two groups were compared. The relationships between altered cortical characteristics and flight training days were investigated through correlation analysis.ResultsThe results indicated that flight training was associated with certain parameters of brain structure. Specifically, in the left rostral anterior cingulate area, the flight group displayed prominent gyri, whereas the control group exhibited sulci. The structural changes in these two groups followed completely opposite trends.ConclusionIn conclusion, the affected areas are primarily concentrated in brain regions associated with multisensory integration and multitasking, which may reflect neural adaptations induced by flight training.",
