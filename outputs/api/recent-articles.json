      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "The Human Hippocampus Is Involved in Auditory Short-Term Memory Trace Formation",
      "content": "The human hippocampus has been claimed to play an important role in long-term memory, or episodic memory. It has long been argued whether the hippocampus does contribute to short-term memory. Here, we demonstrate human hippocampus has been involved in auditory short-term memory (ASTM) trace formation. We used a classic oddball paradigm and intracranial recordings across various human brain areas. High frequency activities evoked by deviant stimuli in subjects indicate the generation of ASTM trace. Auditory response latencies recorded from the hippocampus, insula, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe showed the early processing of ASTM trace at a pre-attention stage. Moreover, Granger causality analyses showed ASTM trace is processed in hierarchical cortical areas and interactions among this memory process have been clarified. Specifically, bottom-up auditory signals processed by the insula, and auditory regions of the temporal lobe and the frontal lobe at an early stage, then auditory top-down information transmitted from the frontal lobe to the hippocampus, the inferior temporal lobe, as well as insula at a relatively late pre-attention stage of the auditory information processing. These results provide evidence that the human hippocampus contributes to the short-term memory of auditory perception at a pre-attention stage and suggests a challenge to entrenched beliefs in the classification/definition of memory systems.",

      "title": "Informational and Normative Influence on Conformity in Autism",
      "content": "This preregistered study examined whether adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show reduced social conformity and whether any such reduction depends on the type of social influence. Social conformity, defined as the tendency to adjust judgments to align with those of others, is typically driven by normative (acceptance-seeking) and informational (accuracy-seeking) motives. Thirty adults with ASD and 30 matched neurotypical (NT) adults completed two tasks: a preference rating task indexing normative influence, and a dot-counting task indexing informational influence with monetary rewards. Contrary to our predictions, adults with ASD conformed as much as NT adults in the preference rating task but showed significantly reduced conformity in the dot-counting task. Exploratory analyses indicated that this reduction was driven by a distinct subgroup of nine adults with ASD who never revised their initial estimates despite informative social cues, resulting in poorer accuracy and lower rewards. When this subgroup was excluded, group differences in conformity were no longer evident. These findings suggest that, overall, adults with ASD are as susceptible as NT adults to normative influence but less responsive to informational influence, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between types of social influence and considering individual differences when characterizing social behavior in ASD.",

      "title": "DENDRO: Recovery and denoising of whole-tree dendritic voltagefrom 2D voltage movies",
      "content": "The ability to image voltage at high spatiotemporal resolution across an entire dendritic tree would represent a major advance in systems and circuit neuroscience. Recent advances in genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have brought this possibility closer to reality. However, due to fundamental tradeoffs between imaging speed, resolution, SNR, and volume, this goal has remained out of reach. Here we develop a computational method that fuses 3D anatomical information with 2D voltage video data, yielding full time-varying 3D voltage estimates. Our method, termed DENDRO, comprises two steps. In step one, we use the anatomical data to build a microscope model which maps from voltages along the tree to observed fluorescence at the imaging plane. By exploiting local spatial smoothness of the voltage signal, we parameterize the voltage signal using a set of local basis functions, which reduces the dimensionality of the problem and allows us to approximately invert the microscope model. This step leverages spatial but not temporal smoothness of the underlying signal and yields noisy 3D estimates. In step two, we train a lightweight self-supervised neural network to perform spatiotemporal denoising of the inferred voltages. On simulated data, we find that DENDRO is able to recover voltages at high accuracy across an entire dendritic tree. On real voltage movies from hippocampal slices, DENDRO recovers known dendritic phenomena at single trial resolution and millisecond time-scales, and allows visualization of backpropagating action potentials in 3D.",
