      "title": "Trial-Level Sequence Modeling Reveals Hidden Dynamics of Dual-Task Interference",
      "content": "Theories of dual-task interference assume that the same cognitive operations underlie multitasking regardless of stimulus timing, yet this core assumption has remained untested due to methodological limitations of behavioral averaging. Here, we combine hidden multivariate pattern (HMP) analysis with deep spatiotemporal sequence modeling of single-trial EEG to uncover the neural dynamics of multitasking in the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm. Using a deep spatiotemporal sequence model trained on Long stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA) trials, we identify Encoding, Central, and Response operations and show that these same operations occur in the Short SOA condition, demonstrating shared cognitive processes across interference conditions. Additionally, trial-level decoding reveals multiple distinct sequences of cognitive operations across both tasks during interference, varying both within and across individuals. These sequences predict behavioral differences in reaction time and accuracy, revealing how interference timing within the cognitive operation sequence influences performance. In other words, we found trial-by-trial variability related to individual strategies directly affecting accuracy and reaction time (RT). Our findings challenge static bottleneck accounts and establish trial-level sequence modeling as a powerful tool to investigate the hidden dynamics of multitasking.",

      "title": "Fixel-Based Analysis reveals microstructural visual pathway changes associated with retinal remodeling in retinitis pigmentosa",
      "content": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, traditionally considered a photoreceptor degenerative disorder. However, the relationship between retinal degeneration and structural alterations along central visual pathways remains poorly understood. We investigated possible structural links across the retinocortical pathway in 15 genetically characterized RP patients (RHO, PDE6A, PDE6B mutations) compared with 22 healthy controls, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) combined with diffusion-weighted MRI and fixel-based analysis (FBA). Retinal segmentation revealed marked outer layer thinning (outer nuclear layer: -55% foveal, -77% parafoveal) with significant inner layer thickening at the fovea (inner plexiform layer +29%, inner nuclear layer +40%). Parafoveal regions showed near-complete photoreceptor loss but inner retinal thickness approaching normal values. FBA demonstrated significant fiber density reductions in optic tracts and optic radiations, without corresponding macrostructural changes in tract cross-section, suggesting early microstructural disruption preceding atrophy. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between parafoveal inner plexiform layer thickness and fiber density in both optic tracts (r=0.856) and radiations (r=0.768), with no correlations observed at the foveal level. These findings demonstrate complex, region-specific retinal remodeling in RP, likely reflecting Muller cell gliosis rather than mechanical compensation. The fiber density reduction without tract atrophy suggests trans-synaptic degeneration along visual pathways. This multimodal framework provides insights into structural propagation in inherited retinal dystrophies and may serve as a biomarker for evaluating therapeutic interventions aimed at photoreceptor restoration.",

      "title": "Learning in nonstationary environments with minimal neuralcircuitry",
      "content": "Animals inhabit continually changing environments where it is not always possible to infer causes of relevant changes, such as the appearance of a new threat. In such nonstationary settings, learning a predictive model is challenging because a surprising observation could be due to chance, or due to systematic but uninferrable causes. This issue magnifies for short-lived animals with small nervous systems and limited opportunity to explore. To understand how the nervous system negotiates these challenges, we derived a new learning principle, Hetlearn (Heterologous Learners), based on the physiology and multi-compartmental architecture of the Drosophila mushroom body, a key associative learning circuit. Hetlearn circumvents learning full causal models of the environment, making it less fragile to nonstationarity. In stationary settings, Hetlearn is efficient and outperforms Bayesian inference when data are limited. Hetlearn predicts observed learning behaviour in Drosophila across multiple tasks and provides new, testable predictions about circuit interactions during learning.",

      "title": "Dysregulation of transcription networks regulating oligodendrogenesis in age-related decline in CNS remyelination",
      "content": "In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS), efficient remyelination is critical for functional recovery. Remyelination efficiency declines with age, and is linked to progressive disability. The gene regulatory network underlying remyelination, and how it is altered with aging, remains unclear. Here we present a comparative single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analysis of remyelination in young and aged mice. We identified gene modules dynamically expressed throughout oligodendrocyte differentiation, revealing age-dependent changes in key processes related to myelination. Multi-omic analysis allowed us to map the regulatory network driving efficient remyelination within oligodendrocyte lineage cells in young mice. We highlight key transcription factors in the network dysregulated with age, and we describe similar dysregulations in MS lesions. Modifying the expression of these transcription factors in primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells impacts differentiation. These findings provide a foundational understanding of this regenerative process in the context of aging and in chronic demyelinating diseases.",

      "title": "Relative phase of membrane potential theta oscillations between individual hippocampal neurons code space",
      "content": "The timing of spikes dictates a neuron's impact on downstream circuits and behavior, and spike timing is determined by the membrane potential (Vm). However, due to technical challenges, it has been impossible to analyze the relative timing of Vm dynamics between neurons during behavior. Using large scale membrane voltage imaging, we simultaneously recorded Vm from many individual hippocampal neurons in animals engaged in a virtual spatial task. We found that relative phase of Vm theta oscillations across neurons exhibit gradual or discrete shifts depending on spatial position. This finding extends beyond previous studies showing Vm dynamics in single neurons or spiking activity in multiple neurons, revealing previously unknown evidence for consistent coding of space by spike-independent relative phase of Vm theta dynamics between neurons.",

      "title": "Context-specific configuration of orthogonal integrator dynamics for flexible foraging decisions",
      "content": "The capacity to adapt behavior across different contexts is a fundamental feature of intelligence and is crucial for animal life, yet the mechanisms by which neural circuits are contextually reconfigured to alter their function are poorly understood. As a universal, ecological behavior, foraging provides a natural window into the neural basis of decision making and cognitive flexibility. We developed complementary free-moving and virtual tasks in which mice make foraging decisions and switch between context-specific decision strategies by toggling distinct configurations of integrator dynamics for evidence accumulation. Neural recordings reveal brain-wide activity states recruited by foraging environments which organize divergent dynamics subspaces and orthogonal coding of context-specific decision variables in separate neural subpopulations. In the dorsal frontal cortex, this coding structure is preserved across experimental settings, supports rapid dynamics reconfiguration for volitional mode switching, and is functionally necessary for decision flexibility.",
