      "title": "Arousal modulates functional connectivity through structured and hemispherically asymmetric community architecture during wakefulness",
      "content": "Arousal fluctuates continuously during wakefulness, yet how these moment-to-moment variations shape large-scale functional connectivity (FC) remains unclear. Here, we combined 7T fMRI with concurrent pupillometry to quantify, for every functional connection, how time-varying FC covaries with spontaneous arousal in the awake human brain. Rather than exerting a uniform influence across the connectome, arousal organized FC into a low-dimensional set of seven connectivity communities, each defined by characteristic network compositions. These communities exhibited systematic but community-specific hemispheric asymmetries, revealing distinct patterns of lateralized arousal modulation. Notably, the ventral attention network showed a pronounced division of labor: left-hemisphere nodes participated flexibly across multiple arousal-sensitive communities, whereas right-hemisphere nodes formed a cohesive, segregated arousal-responsive module. Importantly, hemispheric asymmetry did not arise from global shifts in connectivity strength, but instead reflected structured spatial heterogeneity embedded within community architecture. This modular and asymmetric organization was highly preserved during naturalistic movie watching, indicating that arousal-related modulation of FC reflects intrinsic principles that generalize across awake cognitive contexts. Together, these findings demonstrate that moment-to-moment arousal fluctuations shape large-scale FC through structured, hemispherically asymmetric network organization during wakefulness.",

      "content": "High-density Neuropixels probes enable the study of large neural populations with single-cell and sub-millisecond resolution. While single-probe and acute head-fixed experiments have yielded critical scientific insights, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying many complex behaviors requires simultaneous multi-region recordings in freely moving, chronically implanted animals. Various probe fixtures have been developed to enable high-density recording, but existing designs impose critical limitations: their substantial weight restricts the maximum probe count that smaller animals can support, their bulky dimensions constrain the proximity of targeted brain regions, and their complex assembly risks damaging the probe during insertion and recovery. In this paper, we present a lightweight, fully 3D-printable, compact, and screwless fixture for chronic Neuropixels implants in freely moving rodents that features simple mechanisms for stable implantation and safe extraction. Our fixture design enables stable, high-yield single-unit recordings for months-long experiments, along with an 83% successful probe extraction rate. This fixture design provides a robust and accessible solution for long-term, multi-probe chronic Neuropixels recordings, increasing experimental throughput and enabling more complex experimental designs to investigate brain-wide neural dynamics.",

      "content": "Live sport spectatorship can promote social connection, yet scalable, low-burden strategies to strengthen bonding in real-world spectator settings remain limited. We here tested the hypothesis that co-consuming sparkling water during spectating attenuates hunger and fatigue and strengthens enjoyment and perceived unity, potentially via HR synchrony linked to oxytocin dynamics. In an individually randomized field experiment at a collegiate women basketball home game (sparkling water: n = 21; plain water: n = 19), spectators consumed 200 mL of sparkling water or plain water in synchrony before tip-off and before the end of halftime, with additional ad libitum intake of the assigned beverage permitted thereafter. We assessed acute freshness and hunger, repeated fatigue and enjoyment, interpersonal HR synchrony from the first half to 15-min post-game, perceived unity toward players and fellow spectators, and salivary oxytocin levels. Relative to plain water, sparkling water increased freshness and reduced hunger after intake, attenuated post-game fatigue, and enhanced enjoyment and perceived unity. HR synchrony was preserved in association with attenuated post-game fatigue after the game, and sustained synchrony was associated with higher perceived unity. Oxytocin decreased more in the sparkling-water group, and this decrease was associated with preserved HR synchrony as well as with changes in unity toward fellow fans. These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that co-consuming sparkling water serves as an alcohol-free, low-burden ritual to enhance social connection during and after live sport events.",

      "title": "Long-lasting astrocyte remodeling in Dravet Syndrome Scn1a+/- mouse model.",
      "content": "Background. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a prototypical developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by SCN1A gene mutations leading to NaV1.1 loss of function. The latter causes early-onset drug-resistant seizures and enduring cognitive and behavioral deficits. In this pathological context, the implication of astrocytes remains insufficiently explored. Methods. Using a heterozygous Scn1a knock-out (Scn1a+/-) mouse model that recapitulates the DS-human phenotype, we examine astrocyte remodeling at landmark disease stages, as defined by video-EEG and behavioral read-outs. Results. From initial disease aggravation (PN20-35) to long-term stabilization (up to PN90), Scn1a+/- mice showed increased hippocampal and cortical GFAP transcript and protein levels, compared to age-matched control littermates and to an earlier pre-symptomatic (<PN20) time point. During the aggravation phase in Scn1a+/- mice, astrocyte branching, revealed by GFAP histological analysis and by intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 488 in hippocampal slices was increased but not sustained long-term. These disease-stage-dependent astrocyte modifications were not associated with macroscopic hippocampal sclerosis or cortical atrophy. To further study astrocyte remodeling during disease progression, we used biocytin diffusion following single-astrocyte loading to reveal an expanded astrocyte-astrocyte network in Scn1a+/- mice long-term, along with increased Cx30 and Cx43 protein levels. An ethidium bromide uptake assay indicated impaired astrocytic hemichannel function in Scn1a+/- mice long-term. Regionally, these long-term cellular and network astrocyte modifications coincided with augmented post-tetanic synaptic potentiation. Discussion. In DS, astrocytes undergo a long-lasting network remodeling. We discuss how this astrocyte remodeling may be related to seizures as well as synaptic and cognitive deficits.",
