      "title": "A shared perceptual inference for cross-modally induced illusions of self-attribution.",
      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

      "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "title": "Show HN: Chart Preview \u2013 Preview environments for Helm charts on every PR",
      "content": "<p>I\u2019m a software engineer who accidentally became my team\u2019s Kubernetes person \u2014 and eventually the bottleneck for every Helm chart PR.<p>I built Chart Preview so reviewers could see Helm chart changes running without waiting on me.<p>A few years ago, my team needed to implement HA for an existing product, which meant deploying on Kubernetes and OpenShift. I spent months learning Kubernetes, Helm, and the surrounding ecosystem. After that, Kubernetes largely became \u201cmy thing\u201d on the team.<p>We later published public Helm charts for the product, and customers started submitting PRs. Those PRs would often sit for months \u2014 not because the changes were bad, but because testing them meant manually spinning up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the chart with the proposed changes, running through test scenarios, and coordinating verification with product and QA. Since I was the only one who could reliably set up those environments, everything waited on me.<p>I kept thinking: what if the PR itself showed the changes working? What if reviewers could just click a link and see it deployed?<p>That idea became Chart Preview.<p>Chart Preview deploys your Helm chart to a real Kubernetes cluster when you open a PR, provides a unique preview URL for that PR, and cleans everything up automatically when the PR closes.<p>I started by solving a problem I was personally hitting, rather than surveying the whole market upfront. As I built more of it, I looked at existing preview tools and noticed that while there are solid solutions for previewing container-based applications, Helm-specific workflows introduce different challenges \u2014 chart dependencies, layered values files, and opinionated chart structures. That pushed me to focus Chart Preview on being Helm-native first, rather than adapting a container preview workflow to fit Helm.<p>Under the hood, it\u2019s built in Go using the Helm v3 SDK. The architecture is an API server with workers pulling jobs from a PostgreSQL queue \u2014 no Kubernetes operator, just services talking directly to the Kubernetes API. Each preview runs in its own namespace with deny-all NetworkPolicies, ResourceQuotas, and LimitRanges. GitHub integration is done via a GitHub App for check runs and webhooks, with GitLab supported via the REST API.<p>There were a few interesting challenges along the way. Injecting preview hostnames into Ingress resources without corrupting manifests took several iterations. Helm uninstall doesn\u2019t always clean everything up, so deleting the entire namespace turned out to be the safest fallback. Handling rapid pushes to the same PR required build numbering so the latest push always wins. And while the Helm SDK is powerful, it\u2019s under-documented \u2014 I spent a lot of time reading Helm\u2019s source code.<p>I\u2019ve been building and testing this for a few months using real charts like Grafana, podinfo, and WordPress to validate the workflow. It\u2019s early, but it works, and now I\u2019m trying to understand whether other teams have the same pain point I did.<p>You can try it by installing the GitHub App here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apps/chart-preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/apps/chart-preview</a><p>I\u2019d love feedback on a few things:<p>Does this solve a real problem for your team, or is shared staging \u201cgood enough\u201d?<p>What\u2019s missing that would make you actually use it?<p>Are there Helm charts this wouldn\u2019t work for? (Cluster-scoped resources are intentionally blocked.)<p>Happy to answer questions about the implementation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46337764\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46337764</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
