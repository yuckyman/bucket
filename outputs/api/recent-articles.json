      "title": "The emergence of intentional action in early human infancy",
      "content": "Intention lies at the core of human behavior, allowing flexible and goal-directed interaction with the environment. However, how it emerges in infancy remains poorly understood. Here we show that intentional action can emerge before overt reaching, revealing that 3-month-old infants display pupil dilation preceding self-initiated actions during interaction with a suspended mobile toy. This phasic pupil dilation first appeared after movement onset but gradually shifted to precede it through environmental interaction, reflecting the emergence of action preparation and prediction of action outcomes. This shift also implies that infants are capable of anticipating the timing of their forthcoming movements. Furthermore, the antecedent pupil dilation occurred only with efficient movements characterised by reduced muscle co-contractions. These findings suggest that infants learn to predict outcomes of their own actions and initiate particular movements at self-determined timings, marking the emergence of intentional action.",

      "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
      "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.
