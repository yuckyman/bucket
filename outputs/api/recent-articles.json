      "title": "Lifelong maintenance of locomotion by embryonically active dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Locomotor skills arise early in life and must be maintained throughout the lifespan, yet how this continuity is achieved despite major neural remodeling remains unclear. Using Drosophila, which undergoes complete metamorphosis, we show that dopamine neurons (DANs) are active during the embryonic stage and that this early activity is essential for locomotion across all developmental stages and adulthood. Through stage-specific behavioral assays, optogenetics, in vivo brain imaging, and fluorescent neuronal tracking, we identify a subset of ventral nervous system (VNS) DANs that modulate locomotor function throughout life. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that they maintain expression of developmental transcription factors. Knocking down these factors in post-mitotic VNS DANs impairs adult locomotion. These findings uncover a previously overlooked function for embryonic DANs and suggest that stable locomotion during nervous system maturation relies on persistent developmental regulator expression coupled with structural remodeling.",

      "content": "Patients with schizophrenia show strong impairments in visual backward masking, which are associated with reduced EEG N1 responses. However, it is currently unclear whether reduced N1 amplitudes in patients reflect attenuated neural responses or increased inter-trial latency variability, as both can lead to reduced trial-averaged responses. Previous studies using trial-averaged data cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Here, we estimated inter-trial latency variability of the visual N1 component and found significantly increased variability in patients compared to controls. Inter-trial latency-variability was a strong predictor of the N1 amplitude in both groups. Importantly, after accounting for the effect of latency variability in the group comparison, patients continued to exhibit significantly reduced N1 amplitudes, although the effect size diminished from large to medium. These findings indicate that both higher latency variability and attenuated neural responses contribute to visual processing deficits in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Reorganisation of Cortico-Hippocampal White Matter Pathways in Healthy Ageing: Evidence for Paradoxical Shifts in Structural Connectivity.",
      "content": "The hippocampus plays a central role in episodic memory and has been the focus of extensive research over past decades. A substantial body of work has demonstrated that age-related memory decline is linked to changes in how the hippocampus functionally interacts with distributed brain networks. While functional connectivity changes in ageing are well documented, relatively little is known about alterations in the structural connectivity (SC) of the hippocampus, despite its foundational role in supporting communication across neural systems. In this study, we combined high-quality data from the Human Connectome Project and advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods to investigate age-related changes in hippocampal SC. Using a recently developed tractography pipeline that allows greater anatomical specificity than conventional approaches, we systematically compared connectivity patterns between younger (26-30 years) and older (56-60 years) adults. Results revealed reduced hippocampal SC with the entorhinal cortex and medial parietal cortices in older participants, alongside increased SC with anterior temporal areas. This paradoxical pattern suggests that ageing is associated with both vulnerability and reorganisation of hippocampal networks, with increased hippocampal-temporal connectivity potentially reflecting compensatory plasticity in response to reduced posterior medial connection. These findings provide in vivo evidence of cortico-hippocampal structural reorganisation in late middle age, a critical period when pathological processes such as tau deposition are already detectable in cognitively healthy individuals. More broadly, they demonstrate the power of our anatomically refined tractography pipeline as a proof of concept for detecting subtle, regionally specific changes in hippocampal pathway density. This approach holds promise for charting normative ageing trajectories and identifying early biomarkers of vulnerability and compensation in memory-related networks.",

      "title": "The PDE4D ortholog Dunce suppresses memory in Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "The regulation of cAMP concentration is a key component of the mechanisms underlying learning and memory. In Drosophila melanogaster, the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase mutant dunce1 results in increased levels of cAMP but poorer associative short-term memory and anesthesia-resistant memory. This raises the question of how elevated cAMP levels can cause defects in both short-term and long-term memory. To answer this question, we analyzed associative olfactory learning and memory in Drosophila larvae of both sexes with the isoform-specific dunceD143 mutation. Flies with this mutation exhibited better learning than flies with the dunce1 mutant. The memory facilitated by dunceD143 was stable and easily reversable. The improvement in memory was also traced to a defined subset of neurons. A comparison of the subcellular localization of Dunce isoforms indicates that the regulation of cAMP in the soma suppresses early memory formation. We revealed that Dunce regulates at least two different aspects of learning and memory, specifically, preventing the premature formation of memory and facilitating the formation of memory after multiple training sessions. The different functions of Dunce might be due to different cell types.",

      "title": "Neural information sharing across the orienting attentional network predicts intelligence in children",
      "content": "Efficient brain functioning is often defined as the ability to achieve high performance with minimal cognitive resources. This study investigated the relationship between intelligence and attentional network efficiency in school-aged children, using electroencephalography (EEG) during the Attention Network Test (ANT). Participants were 38 children aged 11-14 years, recruited from schools in the Maule Region of Chile. Attentional network efficiency was assessed through event-related potentials (ERPs), midfrontal theta power as an index of conflict processing, and weighted Symbolic Mutual Information (wSMI) to quantify large-scale, nonlinear information sharing. Higher full-scale IQ scores were specifically associated with reduced wSMI within the orienting network, suggesting greater neural efficiency through less widespread information exchange between dorsal frontoparietal nodes. No significant associations were found between IQ and theta-band power during conflict processing. These findings provide novel evidence linking intelligence in childhood to network-level neural efficiency in attentional orienting, supporting the view that individual differences in cognitive ability reflect not only localized neural activity but also the efficiency of information integration within task-relevant networks.",

These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

      "title": "Progranulin loss induces mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis in human cerebral organoids",
      "content": "Loss-of-function mutations in the granulin (GRN) gene cause frontotemporal dementia when the mutations are heterozygous and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a lysosomal storage disease, when homozygous. While it is well established that disease-causing GRN mutations decrease progranulin (PGRN) levels, leading to neurodegeneration, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, we utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived forebrain organoids to investigate the impact of PGRN homozygous deficiency on neuronal and glial cell populations. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified robust downregulation of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway in PGRN KO organoids. In line with these results, PGRN KO organoids showed decreased mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that PGRN loss induced increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and iron accumulation. Finally, we observed increased vulnerability to ferroptotic cell death in PGRN KO organoids. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired responses to oxidative stress are early manifestations of PGRN loss, and offer insights into the molecular mechanisms driving neurodegeneration caused by PGRN deficiency.",
