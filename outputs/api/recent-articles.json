      "title": "Hyperexcitability in Alzheimers Disease triggers a compensatoryneuroprotective response via TREK1",
      "content": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is marked by early hippocampal and neocortical accumulation of amyloid-beta 42 oligomers, driving neuronal hyperactivity and synaptic dysfunction years before symptom onset. While two-pore domain leak potassium channels like TREK1 provide neuroprotection against hyperexcitability, their role in AD remains unknown. Here, we discover an activity-dependent upregulation of TREK1 in AD transgenic mice (3xTg and APP/PS1) and cultured hippocampal/cortical neurons, triggered by amyloid-beta 42 oligomers -induced hyperactivity. Mechanistically, we show that increased intracellular calcium activates adenylate cyclase 1/8 (AC1/8), initiating a cAMP-PKA signalling cascade that enhances the expression of chromatin regulator CTCF. This increased CTCF in turn enhances the expression of TREK1 both in vitro and in AD transgenic mice. Using calcium imaging, patch clamp electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry assays, we demonstrate that the upregulation of TREK1 serves as a critical brake on neuronal hyperexcitability and is essential for restoring synaptic balance and mitigating AD pathology. Our study identifies a multi-step signalling cascade triggered by amyloid-beta 42 oligomers leading to upregulation of TREK1 that functions as an essential compensatory mechanism for neuronal survival in early AD.",

      "title": "Presynaptic Release Probability Determines the Need for Sleep",
      "content": "Sleep is universal among animals with synapses, yet the synaptic functions determining the need for sleep remain elusive. By directly measuring synaptic transmission at anatomically defined synapses in Drosophila, we found that synaptic strength remained stable or declined after sleep deprivation in a circuit-specific manner. In contrast, presynaptic release probability (Pr) consistently decreased with sleep loss across circuits and species, stemming from reduced Ca2+ influx or weakened vesicle-channel coupling at presynaptic terminals, and recovered after sleep. Bidirectional manipulations of Pr altered sleep pressure, establishing a causal relationship between presynaptic function and sleep need. Non-synaptic sleep-regulatory signaling pathways consistently modulate Pr but not synaptic strength. Thus, our findings identify Pr, rather than synaptic strength, as the conserved synaptic substrate underlying sleep need.",

      "content": "Background/Objectives: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss, muscle weakness, and respiratory dysfunction, often culminating in ventilatory failure. Evidence suggests that High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) may modulate motor cortical excitability and potentially influence motor and respiratory function in ALS. This study aims to evaluate the effects of home-based HD-tDCS applied...",
