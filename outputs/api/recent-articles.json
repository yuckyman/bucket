      "title": "ADHD Medications and Preadolescent Brain Structure: Patterns of Cortical Attenuation from the ABCD Study",
      "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the U.S., and the stimulant and nonstimulant medications used to treat ADHD are among the most widely prescribed treatments in youth. Stimulants--including amphetamine-based (AMP) and methylphenidate-based (MPH) medications--act primarily on dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, while nonstimulants (NS) more selectively target noradrenergic pathways. Although pharmacotherapy is the most clinically effective treatment, its neurostructural effects remain poorly understood. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study(R)), we used a machine learning approach to identify neuroanatomical targets of medications, followed by linear mixed-effects modeling to estimate the effects of ADHD status and medication class (AMP, MPH, NS) on cortical thickness, surface area, and cortical and subcortical volumes. ADHD was not associated with statistically significant differences; however, a consistent pattern emerged in which AMP and MPH effects attenuated ADHD effects, suggesting that stimulant medications may attenuate ADHD-related cortical patterns. NS medications showed a similar, albeit weaker, effect pattern. Notably, AMP and/or MPH use was associated with significant effects in the right entorhinal cortex and the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus, potentially reflecting overcompensatory effects, as well as in the left posterior cingulate, possibly indicating de novo medication-related differences.",

      "title": "Single nuclear RNA sequencing shows altered microglial and astrocytic functions in post-mortem Parkinson's disease tissue",
      "content": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease marked by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and formation of misfolded protein aggregates. A growing body of research has implicated glial cell dysfunction in PD etiology, including the concentration of activated glial cells around protein aggregates in post-mortem tissue. Disruptions in the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory immune response functions of the microglia and astrocytes is believed to contribute towards neurons being lost as the disease progresses. However, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To shed light on the role of inflammation in PD, this study analyses two public single nuclear RNA sequencing datasets of the SNpc from patient and control postmortem brain to identify altered molecular pathways in PD-associated microglia and astrocytes. Results: The results show that both cell types have a significant upregulation in heat shock binding and misfolded protein response pathways, likely in response to the accumulation of protein aggregates. Microglia annotated with the MKI67 marker gene show a decreased expression in PD patient derived tissue. Markers associated with activated/reactivated states in astrocytes and microglia are upregulated in PD samples. Notably, expression of genes associated with resting state microglia and non-inflammatory reactive state microglia are downregulated in PD microglia, including P2RY12, CSF1R, CSF2RA, CSF3R, and TGFBR1. Concurrently, genes associated with activated microglial states such as HSP90AB1 and GPNMB are upregulated. Among the top downregulated functions, genes associated with ion channel functions are downregulated in both astrocytes and microglia. Conclusions: Taken together, the findings imply that astrocytes and microglia respond to protein misfolding pathology in PD by upregulating chaperone protein folding functions. Additionally, the profile of upregulated genes implies that pathways responding to oxidative stress are also activated. The downregulation of inflammation-associated genes in PD microglia paired with the upregulation of misfolding protein response pathways, suggests a switch from immune receptor functions to protein aggregate clearance by the end of disease stages. Finally, GPNMB emerged as a potential target for therapeutic intervention, as the one primary non-HSP gene that is significantly increased in PD-associated microglia.",

      "title": "Development of Recombinant Anti-TLR2 Antibodies and PLGA Nanoparticle-based Gene Therapy for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain",
      "content": "Neuroinflammation is a key contributor to neuropathic pain, with microglial Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) playing a central role in initiating and sustaining proinflammatory responses. However, existing TLR2-targeting antibody therapies are limited by poor delivery to the central nervous system and short-lived efficacy. We developed a non-viral gene therapy strategy using biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver recombinant anti-TLR2 antibody genes. High-affinity nanobody and single-chain variable fragment candidates were selected through phage display screening and shown to suppress TLR2-dependent signaling both in vitro and in vivo. In mouse models of neuropathic pain, a single intrathecal administration of PLGA NP-encapsulated antibody genes produced robust and sustained analgesia, accompanied by reduced glial activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression. These findings demonstrate a modular NP-based platform for sustained antibody expression in the central nervous system and establish its potential for the treatment of chronic pain driven by innate immune activation.",

      "title": "Exclusive ipsilateral representation of sequential tactile differences challenges contralateral dominance",
      "content": "Tactile perception is traditionally attributed to contralateral somatosensory (S1) processing, yet the functional role of ipsilateral S1 in human tactile discrimination remains unclear. Using fMRI during a sequential vibrotactile discrimination task, we examined how frequency information is represented when participants judged which of two successive stimuli delivered to the same fingertip was higher in frequency. Contralateral S1 showed robust activation, and ipsilateral S1 showed suppression during unilateral stimulation; however, linear mixed-effects analyses revealed reliable frequency-dependent modulation in ipsilateral S1, which was absent when no comparison was required. Multivariate representational analyses further demonstrated that fMRI activity patterns representing the differences between successive stimuli were strengthened under memory demands, particularly within ipsilateral S1 and parietal cortices. Furthermore, the representational separability predicted individual discrimination accuracy. The exclusive representation in the ipsilateral S1 was not hand-specific; that is, the results were consistent for both hands, indicating a bilateral and symmetric encoding scheme. These surprising findings demonstrate that the ipsilateral, not contralateral, S1 contributes to tactile discrimination, challenging classic contralateral models of somatosensory processing. These unprecedented findings highlight interhemispheric coordination as a key mechanism underlying perceptual decisions.",

      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

      "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",
