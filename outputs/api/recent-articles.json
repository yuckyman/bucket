      "title": "Disruption of the ganglioside-PMCA-Np nexus leads to impaired calcium homeostasis in glioblastoma",
      "content": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by the disruption of multiple signaling pathways, particularly those governing calcium homeostasis. Additionally, cell membranes in GBM exhibit altered lipidomic profiles, especially complex sialoglycans gangliosides, which affect plasma membranes both structurally and functionally. In this work we show a disruption of a plasma membrane molecular triad composed of gangliosides, neuroplastin (Np), and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) in GBM, leading to a severely diminished PMCA activity. Our transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, lipidomic, and in silico analyses demonstrated downregulation of Np and PMCA isoforms at mRNA and protein levels in our GBM cohort, in agreement with broader trends observed in public datasets. Analysis of the uniquely changed GBM ganglioside profile in the context of PMCA and Np expression and PMCA activity reveals GD3 as a key molecular determinant of reduced PMCA activity in GBM samples. In contrast, GD1b, necessary for optimal PMCA function in healthy tissue, is significantly reduced in GBM. Our findings establish the gangliosides-PMCA-Np nexus as a crucial complex involved in calcium signaling in GBM, contributing to GBM etiology and progression.",

      "title": "Neuronal silencing through depolarization block underlies odor discrimination",
      "content": "The olfactory system enables animals to distinguish between attractive and aversive odor sources through the perception of odorant molecules. A fundamental challenge is maintaining stable odor identity perception despite fluctuating stimulus intensities during navigation. Using the numerically simple olfactory system of the Drosophila larva, we combined a quantitative odor discrimination assay, electrophysiology, computational modelling, and ectopic expression of odorant receptors to study the encoding of odor identity. We found that depolarization block, which silences olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) at odor concentrations 3-4 log units above the detection threshold, enables odor discrimination by creating distinct patterns of OSN activity. In a minimal system with two functional OSNs, larvae discriminate between odors when depolarization block creates differential OSN silencing but fail to distinguish odors producing qualitatively similar activity patterns in both OSNs. This principle extends to odor mixtures and the fully functional olfactory system, where the high affinity of the OR42b odorant receptor for one of the test odors enables discrimination regardless of which OSN expresses OR42b. Our results indicate that depolarization block serves as an integral feature of olfactory coding alongside combinatorial OSN activation. Selective silencing of high-affinity OSNs creates distinct neural representations and enables discrimination between odors that would otherwise produce similar activity patterns. This mechanism appears evolutionarily conserved across sensory systems, from olfactory sensory neurons to photoreceptors, suggesting that selective neuronal silencing serves as a mechanism for maintaining distinct sensory representations across stimulus intensities.",

      "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "TET2-dependent differential 5hmC deposition balances adult neural stem cell activation and differentiation",
      "content": "Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes are key regulators of active DNA demethylation, converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and thereby shaping the epigenetic landscape and cellular identity. While their roles have been characterized in pluripotent and some multipotent stem cells, their function in adult neural stem cells (NSCs) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that TET2 is critical for the maintenance and differentiation of adult NSCs, orchestrating locus-specific 5hmC deposition across promoters, gene bodies, and enhancers. Importantly, 5hmC remodeling segregates into two functionally distinct programs: promoter-associated gains of 5hmC are strongly TET2-dependent and drive transcription of genes controlling neural differentiation and calcium signaling, whereas gene body- and enhancer-associated 5hmC gains partially depend on TET2 and sustain proliferative and metabolic pathways, thereby maintaining stemness. Loss of TET2 disrupts these 5hmC programs, downregulates key differentiation- and calcium-related genes, and impairs the normal differentiation-associated increase in intracellular calcium, revealing a functional consequence of altered epigenetic regulation. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal role for TET2 in coordinating complementary epigenetic and transcriptional programs that balance stemness and differentiation in adult NSCs.",

      "title": "Low-Frequency Textured Gabor Flicker Enhances SSVEP Entrainment and Visual Comfort for BCI Control",
      "content": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are widely used in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), but the visual discomfort induced by plain luminance repetitive flickers limits their usability in mono- and especially multi-target settings due to strong peripheral distraction. Textured flicker composed of small Gabor patches has recently been proposed as a more comfortable alternative: in slow, aperiodic paradigms, these stimuli are almost invisible in the periphery yet elicit stronger visual evoked responses. However, their suitability for strictly frequency-defined SSVEP paradigms, and their frequency-dependent impact on neural entrainment and BCI performance, remain unclear. Here, we combined a systematic frequency sweep (3-18 Hz) followed by a five-class SSVEP BCI to directly compare subtly textured Gabor-based flicker against classical luminance flicker. In Session 1 (N = 24), we measured SSVEP signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), inter-trial coherence (ITC), and subjective comfort for 13 stimulation frequencies (3-12 Hz in 1 Hz steps, then 14, 16, 18 Hz). Gabor-based textures yielded significantly higher SNR and ITC than plain flicker in the 3-9 Hz range, whereas plain flicker produced stronger and more phase-consistent responses at 12-18 Hz, revealing a robust crossover in entrainment. Across almost all frequencies, Gabor stimuli were also rated as more comfortable. Based on these data, we defined a low-frequency Gabor-optimized band (5-7 Hz) and a higher plain-optimized band (14-16 Hz). In Session 2 (N = 18), we used these bands in a five-class offline BCI with an 8-channel semi-dry EEG system and TRCA-based decoding. Classification accuracy was highest when each stimulus type was used in its own optimal band (Gabor: 95.7% at 5-7 Hz; plain: 98.1% at 14-16 Hz) and dropped markedly when stimulus type and band were mismatched. Across both bands, Gabor stimuli were consistently rated as more comfortable and less peripherally distracting than plain flicker. Together, these results establish textured Gabor flicker as a comfortable and effective alternative to luminance flicker for low-frequency SSVEP paradigms, revealing complementary frequency regimes for texture- and luminance-driven entrainment. This frequency-aware design space advances both perceptual neuroscience and the development of user-centered, multi-target SSVEP BCIs.",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.
