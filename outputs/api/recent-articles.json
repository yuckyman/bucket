      "content": "Mounting evidence shows sex-based differences in sleep experiences and outcomes, including the prevalence of insomnia disorder. However, the impact of biological sex on brain oscillations during sleep remains poorly understood, especially in the context of insomnia disorder. This is a notable gap, given that neurophysiological aspects of sleep are associated with brain health and overall sleep quality. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed data from studies reporting spindle and slow wave activity in adults with and without insomnia disorder. We conducted systematic searches in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria, with thirteen studies of normal sleepers (N= 668) reporting sufficient data for random-effects meta-analyses. Compared with males, female normal sleepers had higher spindle density, sigma and delta power. Most studies recruited individuals with primary insomnia, and data pooling for insomnia and mixed groups was not possible due to insufficient statistical reporting. Moreover, group-by-sex interactions were limited, inconsistent, and varied across studies and sample characteristics. Further research is needed to explore sex-specific differences in sleep microarchitecture and their role in normal sleep and the manifestation of insomnia disorder.",

      "title": "Geometric structure of features underlies human VTC object recognition.",
      "content": "The ventral temporal cortex (VTC) plays a crucial role in human object recognition. Within VTC neural space, object-specific domains align with domain-general features, e.g. face- and scene-domain align with the feature distribution of animacy, generating a hierarchical knowledge structure for categorization. However, the neural process of integrating information from VTC to distinguish different objects remains unclear. Here, we employed a combination of ANN modeling, functional MRI, and MEG to investigate how VTC features affect object manifold separability. The representational geometry analysis shows that domain-general features in VTC form a unique structure, different from ANN, to assist object classification. Moreover, VTC dynamically adjusts the geometrical relationship of these features during object recognition, influencing the geometrical properties of object manifolds and, consequently, their separability. These findings advance our understanding of the neural computation involved in VTC object recognition, revealing how downstream neurons can flexibly access category information in diverse recognition tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",

      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) promotes myelin repair and plasticity in the mouse motor cortex",
      "content": "Cortical myelin loss and oligodendroglial dysfunction, hallmarks of numerous neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, compromise executive, sensory, and cognitive functions by altering circuit activity and integrity. Promoting cortical myelin repair therefore represents a critical therapeutic goal. In this frame, modulation of neuronal activity through non-invasive brain stimulation may represent a promising non-pharmacological approach to support remyelination. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (A-tDCS) in a mouse model of unilateral myelin injury in the motor cortex. A-tDCS was delivered over the contralateral uninjured cortex during a bilateral motor task (locomotion), to enhance the physiological activity of interhemispheric M1-M1 projections and indirectly stimulate the lesioned cortex. When applied during the late phase of demyelination and the onset of repair, A-tDCS accelerated remyelination and increased oligodendroglial survival and maturation in the lesioned cortex, compared with unstimulated controls. Increased myelin was also detected in the directly stimulated uninjured cortex despite unchanged oligodendroglial cell numbers, suggesting de novo myelin formation or remodeling of existing internodes. These structural changes were accompanied by preservation of interhemispheric M1-M1 functional connectivity upon injury. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that A-tDCS promotes cortical myelin repair in vivo, supporting its therapeutic potential for disorders characterized by myelin damage. Notably, the observed effects of tDCS on myelin plasticity in the uninjured cortex - reported here for the first time - reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying tDCS-mediated neuromodulation.",

      "title": "Bright calcium-modulated bioluminescent indicators for activity imaging and red photon-assisted synaptic transmission",
      "content": "Bioluminescent calcium sensors have unique uses in neuroscience and neuroengineering, enabling noninvasive imaging of neuronal activity and contactless activation of opsin-expressing neurons. However, the speed, range, and robustness of non-invasive imaging and rewiring or neuronal activity are limited by the radiance and dynamic range of existing bioluminescent calcium sensors. Here, we report the stepwise engineering of improved cyan-excitable red fluorescent proteins (mCyRFP4 and dCyRFP4), an improved red bioluminescent protein based on NanoLuc and CyRFP4 (Antares3), and an improved bioluminescent calcium sensor based on Antares3 (CaMBI3). Antares3 is 3-fold brighter than its predecessor, while CaMBI3 responds with an overall dynamic range of 24-fold, enabling high-sensitivity detection of calcium dynamics in muscle and neuronal tissues in vivo. Finally, a CaMBI3 variant and a red-shifted opsin ChRmine enabled red photon-assisted synaptic transmission in C. elegans. CaMBI3 thus facilitates genetically targeted non-invasive imaging and rewiring of neural activity in living animals.",

      "title": "Temporal sequence geometry enables odor recognition and generalization",
      "content": "Animals encode sensory stimuli with precisely timed neural activity across modalities. For example, mice can rapidly recognize odors, independent of their concentration, using information relayed from their olfactory bulbs by complex spatiotemporal patterns of mitral and tufted cell (MTC) activity. Yet, it remains unknown how MTC activity patterns are structured, and what role precisely timed activity sequences play in guiding perception. Here we investigated the geometry of MTC odor tuning and the structure of odor response sequences by performing fast 2-photon calcium imaging of hundreds of MTCs with sub-sniff resolution. We constructed a space of MTC tuning using the pairwise correlations between MTC odor responses averaged over a sniff and discovered that odor specific sequential activity traversed this space in smooth, continuous trajectories. Further, we found that the early but not the later part of sequences carried concentration invariant information about odor identity. Finally, inspired by observation that neighboring MTCs in the tuning space are activated together in time independently of the odors presented, we propose a role of activity sequences in training the piriform cortex to learn perceptually generalizable odor representations. To test these ideas, we constructed and analyzed a computational model for sequence-based unsupervised training of synapses from MTCs to the piriform cortex, which revealed that sequential activity across the entire sniff permits perceptual generalization for novel odors, acting as a scaffold for learning relevant activity manifolds between networks.",
