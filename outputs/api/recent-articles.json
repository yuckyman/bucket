      "title": "The development of an asymmetric accessory olfactory bulb in Octodon degus and the influence of social behavior in its establishment",
      "content": "The vomeronasal system (VNS) has been extensively associated with the regulation of sexual and social behaviors in mammals. This system comprises two types of vomeronasal neurons sending parallel projections from the vomeronasal organ (VNO) to the anterior and posterior portions of the accessory olfactory bulb (aAOB and pAOB, respectively). Members of caviomorph rodents develop either a larger aAOB or pAOB bias, which has been associated with ecological traits related to the pheromonal communication displayed by these species. However, it is still unknown how and when such AOB asymmetries emerge and whether experience may influence their establishment. To explore these factors, we studied the development of the VNS in Octodon degus, a caviomorph that exhibits an asymmetric AOB, in which the aAOB is larger and has more glomeruli than the pAOB. We found that both VNO and AOB are present at birth, but exhibiting substantial immature traits. Both VNS structures develop postnatally, showing mature patterns by the end of the first postnatal month. By the second postnatal week, aAOB becomes larger in size than pAOB, however, in the glomerular layer such bias appears later, by the end of the first postnatal month. The AOB asymmetry increases in extent until adulthood, as in this period the pAOB shows a minor growing rate than the aAOB. Additionally, we found that animals raised in restricted social contexts displayed a reduced AOB asymmetry in comparison to wild degus. Overall, we suggest that social experiences contribute to the development of the AOB asymmetry in degus.",

      "content": "Adaptive goal-directed actions performed under the threat of punishment introduce a demand for caution, often expressed as delayed response timing that balances urgency against error risk by allowing more time for cognitive evaluation. Although this form of temporal regulation is essential for survival, its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) regulate the timing of cued actions to avoid harm. Optogenetic activation of the STN, or its projections to the midbrain but not the globus pallidus, modulates action timing in a frequency-dependent manner, accelerating initiation to the extent that animals can no longer respond cautiously, defer actions, or stop initiated actions. These results show that the STN shapes goal-directed behavior by gating action-initiation timing, establishing its midbrain projections as a key circuit for balancing urgency and caution under threat.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I just published an alpha of a small Python library called LLMterface. This is my first attempt at releasing a public library, and I am looking for candid feedback on whether anything looks off or missing from the GitHub repo or PyPI packaging.</p> <p>What My Project Does:</p> <p>LLMterface provides a thin, provider-agnostic interface for sending prompts to large language models and receiving validated, structured responses. The core goal is to keep provider-specific logic out of application code while keeping the abstraction surface area small and explicit. It supports extension via a simple plugin model rather than baking provider details into the core library.</p> <p>Target Audience:</p> <p>This is intended for Python developers who are already integrating LLMs into real applications and want a lightweight way to swap providers or models without adopting a large framework. It is an early alpha and not positioned as production-hardened yet.</p> <p>Comparison:</p> <p>Compared to calling provider SDKs directly, this adds a small abstraction layer to centralize configuration and response validation. Compared to frameworks like LangChain, it deliberately avoids agents, chains, workflows, and prompt tooling, aiming to stay minimal and boring.</p> <p>Feedback Request and links:</p> <p>I would really appreciate feedback on whether this abstraction feels justified, whether the API is understandable after a quick read of the README, and whether there are any obvious red flags in the project structure, documentation, or packaging. GitHub issues are open if that is easier.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/3Ring/LLMterface\">https://github.com/3Ring/LLMterface</a> PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/llmterface/\">https://pypi.org/project/llmterface/</a></p> <p>If this feels unnecessary or misguided, that feedback is just as valuable. I am trying to decide whether this is worth continuing to invest in.</p> <p>Thanks for taking a look.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Punk-in-Pie\"> /u/Punk-in-Pie </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzpxux/critique_on_a_small_boring_llm_abstraction_alpha/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzpxux/critique_on_a_small_boring_llm_abstraction_alpha/\">[comments]</a></span>",
