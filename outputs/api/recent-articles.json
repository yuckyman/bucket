      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

      "title": "Neuropacify: a method to transform and match a patient\u2019s intracranial EEG to their NeuroPace RNS system data",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop responsive neurostimulators, such as the NeuroPace responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system, continuously monitor brain activity and deliver electrical stimulation in response to abnormal electrographic activity in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Practical technical constraints limit the temporal resolution of these devices, reducing the quality of EEG recordings. Approach. In this work, we introduce a novel technique to convert high-resolution intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) obtained from inpatient monitoring into the same format, parameters, and resolution produced by the RNS system, allowing direct comparison of iEEG with RNS system data. We validated this technique using data from patients who had both iEEG and RNS. Electrodes from the iEEG and RNS system were co-registered onto the same 3D coordinate grid, and vector math was applied to determine the iEEG electrodes closest to the operational RNS electrodes. Main results. Through spectral analysis, we derived a transfer function that accounts for all filtering and data processing produced by the RNS system. Comparison of the recorded data using visual and spectral analysis from iEEG and RNS confirmed that EEG characteristics were correctly transformed by the filtering function, allowing analysis of how iEEG signals would appear within the RNS system. We demonstrate two examples from the extreme edges of the spectra, showing how DC shifts and high frequency oscillations would be transformed by the RNS. We provide a tutorial to tune this method to local device parameters, a process that can be applied to other devices as well. Significance. This tool allows researchers and clinicians to extract EEG biomarkers from high-resolution iEEG and determine if/how they can be detected in lower-resolution RNS. This provides an opportunity to develop patient-specific seizure detection parameters and investigate the long-term effects of neurostimulation therapy.",
