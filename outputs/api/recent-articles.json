      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Projection-defined ventral tegmental area neurons exhibit distinct fentanyl-induced molecular and functional adaptations that differentially support drug-context associations",
      "content": "Synthetic opioids like fentanyl are contributing to unprecedented overdose rates. Despite the abundance of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, an understanding of fentanyl s effects on the brain remains lacking. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an important site of fentanyl s rewarding actions in the brain and sends diverse projections to several regions including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Previous work shows downstream projection target influences baseline properties and opioid-induced neuroadaptations in VTA, but most work has focused on single neurotransmitter-defined cell types. Here, we investigate how projection-defined VTA neurons exhibit different responses to fentanyl independent of cell type. We use RNA sequencing to show that fentanyl induces discordant transcriptional adaptations in VTA neurons that project to NAc vs PFC. We then used fiber photometry and chemogenetics to characterize functional differences in fentanyl-related behavior. We found different timescales of activation between VTA-NAc and VTA-PFC during conditioned place preference that support distinct aspects of fentanyl-context association. Together, our data demonstrate that based on projection target alone, VTA neurons can undergo vastly different adaptations in response to fentanyl, providing new insight into VTA encoding of opioid behaviors.",

      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-Synuclein neuronal aggregation and loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Developing animal models that replicate PD neuropathological phenotypes is critical for understanding its pathophysiology and evaluating potential therapeutic targets. In this study, we show that direct unilateral injection of human Synuclein PFFs into the Substantia Nigra (SN) of mutant A53T alpha-synuclein overexpressing mice induce bilateral phosphorylated alpha-Synuclein (pS129) pathology in the SN. This pathology spreads to the striatum, cerebral cortex, and midbrain within 60 days and is accompanied by neuroinflammation in the midbrain and cerebral cortex. Additionally, we observed synuclein-dependent neurodegeneration, with a 50% reduction in Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) intensity in the SN and a 40% reduction in Striatum, both bilaterally. The model also revealed a compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB) and T-cell infiltration in the PFF injected animals, correlating with pS129 pathology and neuroinflammation. Taken together, we developed a mouse model that recapitulates multiple PD phenotypes, providing a valuable platform for testing therapeutic strategies targeting human alpha-Synuclein pathology and for exploring CNS-peripheral immune interactions in PD.",

      "title": "Early, sex-dependent and progressive proteomic imbalance in the amygdala during Alzheimers disease progression",
      "content": "Background: The amygdala is involved in the emotional expression, memory processing and managing stimulatory input. Although amygdala atrophy is early evidenced in Alzheimers Disease (AD), the molecular mechanisms disrupted in initial neuropathological stages are still unknown. In the present study, we investigated the proteomic impairment of the amygdaloid region from AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects to better understand the neuropathological processes occurred early in this area and to identify potential targets that may face AD from the beginning of the disease. Methods: Label-free quantitative proteomics was applied using an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass-spectrometer in 24 postmortem amygdala specimens derived from non-demented (n=3F/5M), AD-Braak stage I-II (n=4F/4M) and AD-Braak stage III-IV (n=4F/4M). Data analysis was performed using MaxQuant and Perseus software (two-way Student T-test; p<0.05). Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis softwares were considered for biological interpretation. Connectivity map platform was used for drug repurposing analyses. Transcriptomic/proteomic data of other brain regions were obtained from AlzData, Neuropro, and Agora repositories. Results: Amygdaloid proteome of AD-Braak stage I-II and III-IV subjects compared to controls revealed a progressive proteomic impairment with a minimal overlap across Braak stages. Some of the amygdaloid DEPs were known interactors of human A{beta} plaques, APP, or Tau proteins or were previously identified at transcriptional or translational level in other brain regions affected by AD. Interestingly, amygdaloid proteome was more severely affected in women than in men with a particular protein expression profile associated to each AD stage. Comparing our sex-dependent differential proteome datasets with transcriptomic data of different brain regions, we identified potential sex-specific proteins related to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Finally, data-driven drug repositioning using amygdaloid omics profiles unveiled that most of the small molecule candidates were neuropathological stage and/or sex-specific. Conclusions: Early and sex-specific amygdaloid proteome dysregulation in AD highlights the consideration of a deliberate stratification by sex in future research and clinical trials to develop effective therapeutic strategies in AD for both sexes.",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "Neural Responses Underlying Interaural Time Difference Discrimination as a Function of Sensory Reliability in the Barn Owl",
      "content": "<p>Discrimination of sensory stimuli is fundamentally constrained by the information encoded in neuronal responses. In the barn owl, interaural time difference (ITD) serves as a primary cue for azimuthal sound localization and is represented topographically in the midbrain auditory space map in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx). While prior studies have demonstrated a correspondence between spatial tuning and behavioral acuity, it remains unclear how changes in sensory reliability influence this relationship. Here, we examined how behavioral and neuronal ITD discrimination thresholds vary with binaural correlation (BC), which manipulates ITD cue reliability. Using the pupil dilation response as a behavioral metric in head-fixed owls of either sex, we found that ITD just-noticeable differences increased exponentially as BC decreased. In contrast, the widths of ICx ITD tuning curves increased more modestly, indicating that tuning resolution alone does not account for behavioral discrimination performance. By computing the Fisher information from ICx neuronal responses, we showed that the average neuronal discriminability predicts behavioral thresholds across BC values. A habituation-based model incorporating BC-dependent changes in tuning width, firing rate, and response variability successfully accounted for both direction and ITD discrimination. These findings support a model in which perceptual acuity is governed by the combined influence of neuronal tuning and variability and provide a unified framework for understanding how midbrain auditory representations underlie adaptive spatial hearing.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Synapse formation requires the accumulation of cytomatrix proteins and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) at presynaptic active zones (AZs). At <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larval neuromuscular junctions, a sequential process of AZ maturation is observed, with initial incorporation of early scaffolds followed by arrival of late scaffolds and VGCCs. To examine how AZ maturation regulates presynaptic output, serial imaging of AZ formation and function was performed at time-stamped synapses of male larvae expressing glutamate receptors linked to the photoconvertible protein mMaple. Quantal imaging demonstrated older synapses have higher synaptic efficacy and sustain greater release across development, while immature sites lacking VGCC accumulation supported spontaneous fusion. To examine how activity regulates AZ maturation, the effects of cell autonomous disruptions to neurotransmitter release were analyzed. Decreased synaptic transmission reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of material at existing AZs. Generation of an endogenous photoconvertible version of the AZ scaffold protein BRP revealed neuronal silencing decreased the protein's turnover. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in <i>rab3</i> mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Endogenous tagging of the Unc13B early AZ scaffold and the Unc13A late AZ scaffold revealed activity reduction decreased seeding of both early and late scaffolds, in contrast to <i>rab3</i> mutants. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation regulates presynaptic release mode and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Learning novel facts is central to modern life. While cortical regions involved in this process have been identified, the neural substrates underlying successful knowledge acquisition have remained elusive. In this fMRI study, we presented human participants (<i>N</i>&nbsp;= 29; 7, male) with a naturalistic learning task where 120 fictitious encyclopedic facts relating to people or places drawn from three imaginary civilizations. We then compared items that were subsequently recalled to those that were forgotten on a memory test that targeted associative learning, administered on average a day and a half later. To complement univariate analysis, we used multivariate pattern analysis to identify regions sensitive to semantic content during encoding, identifying medial precuneus, left angular gyrus, intraparietal sulcus, ventral occipitotemporal cortex, and the lateral anterior temporal lobes (latATL) bilaterally. Within these regions, the strength of informational content within the precuneus and left latATL predicted subsequent retrieval. In contrast, planned analyses did not find univariate differences between remembered and forgotten facts. Targeted follow-up region of interest analysis indicated a possible role of response magnitude in the left inferior frontal gyrus and no univariate or multivariate effects within medial temporal lobe structures. Collectively, these results support a model of fact learning predominantly driven by the richness of representations within semantic systems that is partially distinct from episodic learning mechanisms.</p>",

      "title": "Intrinsic Dendritic Integration Features of Prefrontal Layer 5 Pyramidal Cell Subclasses",
      "content": "<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is an associative center that integrates various inputs to support cognition. Layer 5 pyramidal cells are themselves associative centers, as their dendrites span all cortical layers and sample multiple input streams. Backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are an important mechanism for integrating synaptic inputs arriving at distinct dendritic locations. bAPs originating in the axon initial segment can depolarize the apical dendrite, activate voltage-gated currents that underlie dendritic processing and synaptic plasticity, and influence the integration of synaptic inputs arriving onto apical dendrites. How effectively bAPs depolarize apical dendrites depends on the cell type, dendritic morphology, and the dendrite's passive and active properties. Here, we found that in a unique subclass of PFC Layer 5 pyramidal cell defined by D3 dopamine receptor (D3R) expression, dendritic calcium responses to bAP stimuli were far greater for a burst of APs than expected from a linear sum of single AP-evoked events in mice of either sex. D3R-expressing neurons electrophysiologically resemble intratelencephalic, D1R-expressing pyramidal neurons but morphologically resemble pyramidal tract, D2R-expressing pyramidal neurons. In both D1R- and D2R-expressing cells, burst-evoked dendritic calcium events largely reflected a linear sum of individual AP responses. In D1R neurons, this was partially due to large-/big-conductance calcium&ndash;activated potassium (BK) channels, while in D2R neurons, both BK and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide&ndash;gated channels contributed. These data demonstrate that the intrinsic dendritic excitability of PFC Layer 5 pyramidal cells widely differs and suggest that nonlinear dendritic excitability in D3R-expressing neurons uniquely positions these cells within PFC circuits.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The relationship of the brain&rsquo;s intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) during the resting state with event-related activity in response to external stimuli remains poorly understood. Here, we bridge this gap by combining computational modeling with human magnetoencephalography (MEG, resting state: <i>N</i> = 64, 45 female; task state: <i>N</i> = 58, 41 female) data to investigate the relation of INTs with task-related activity, e.g., event-related fields (ERFs). Using the Jansen&ndash;Rit model, we first show that intracolumnar (and thus intraregional) excitatory and inhibitory connections (rather than interregional feedback, feedforward, and lateral connections between the columns of different regions) strongly influence both resting-state INTs and task-related ERFs. Secondly, our results demonstrate a positive relationship between the magnitude of event-related fields (mERFs) and INTs, observed in both model simulations and empirical MEG data collected during an emotional face recognition task. Thirdly, modeling shows that the positive relationship of mERF and INT depends on intracolumnar connections through observing that the correlation between them disappears for fixed values of intracolumnar connections. Together, these findings highlight the importance of intracolumnar connections as a shared biological mechanism underlying both the resting state&rsquo;s INTs and the task state&rsquo;s event-related activity including their interplay.</p>",
