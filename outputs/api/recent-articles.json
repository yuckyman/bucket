      "content": "arXiv:2510.23904v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most AI systems today are designed to manage tasks and execute predefined steps. This makes them effective for process coordination but limited in their ability to engage in joint problem-solving with humans or contribute new ideas. We introduce MultiColleagues, a multi-agent conversational system that shows how AI agents can act as colleagues by conversing with each other, sharing new ideas, and actively involving users in collaborative ideation. In a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we compared MultiColleagues to a single-agent baseline. Results show that MultiColleagues fostered stronger perceptions of social presence, produced ideas rated significantly higher in quality and novelty, and encouraged deeper elaboration. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI agents to move beyond process partners toward colleagues that share intent, strengthen group dynamics, and collaborate with humans to advance ideas.",

      "title": "MORA: AI-Mediated Story-Based practice for Speech Sound Disorder from Clinic to Home",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.23887v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Speech sound disorder is among the most common communication challenges in preschool children. Home-based practice is essential for effective therapy and for acquiring generalization of target sounds, yet sustaining engaging and consistent practice remains difficult. Existing story-based activities, despite their potential for sound generalization and educational benefits, are often underutilized due to limited interactivity. Moreover, many practice tools fail to sufficiently integrate speech--language pathologists into the process, resulting in weak alignment with clinical treatment plans. To address these limitations, we present MORA, an interactive story-based practice system. MORA introduces three key innovations. First, it embeds target sounds and vocabulary into dynamic, character-driven conversational narratives, requiring children to actively produce speech to progress the story, thereby creating natural opportunities for exposure, repetition, and generalization. Second, it provides visual cues, explicit instruction, and feedback, allowing children to practice effectively either independently or with caregivers. Third, it supports an AI-in-the-loop workflow, enabling SLPs to configure target materials, review logged speech with phoneme-level scoring, and adapt therapy plans asynchronously -- bridging the gap between clinic and home practice while respecting professional expertise. A formative study with six licensed SLPs informed the system's design rationale, and an expert review with seven SLPs demonstrated strong alignment with established articulation-based treatments, as well as potential to enhance children's engagement and literacy. Furthermore, discussions highlight the design considerations for professional support and configurability, adaptive and multimodal child interaction, while highlighting MORA's broader applicability across speech and language disorders.",

This novel interdisciplinary approach addresses this gap by combining agent development and linguistic analysis to assess the prompted personality of LLM-based agents in a poetry explanation task. We developed a novel, flexible question bank, informed by linguistic assessment criteria and human cognitive learning levels, offering a more comprehensive evaluation than current methods. By evaluating agent responses with natural language processing models, other LLMs, and human experts, our findings illustrate the limitations of purely deep learning solutions and emphasize the critical role of interdisciplinary design in agent development.",

Unlike many musical instruments, our work allows individuals of all skill levels to effortlessly create music by walking into virtual bubbles. Our Augmented Reality experience involves interacting with ever-shifting sound bubbles that the user engages with by stepping into color-coded bubbles within the assigned area using a standalone AR headset. Each bubble corresponds to a cello note, and omits sound from the center of the bubble, and lets the user hear and express in spatial audio, effectively transforming participants into musicians. This interactive element enables users to explore the intersection of spatial awareness, musical rhythm that extends to bodily expression through playful movements and dance-like gestures within the bubble-filled environment. This unique experience illuminates the intricate relationship between spatial awareness and the art of musical performance.",

This study presents five effects that augment the appearance of a physical room to subtly encourage user motion. Our experiment demonstrates users' reactions to the different distortion and augmentation effects in a standard living room, with the distortion effects projected as wall grids, furniture holograms, and small particles in the air. The augmented living room can give the impression of becoming elongated, wrapped, shifted, elevated, and enlarged. The study results support the implementation of AR experiences in limited physical spaces by providing an initial understanding of how users can be subtly encouraged to move throughout a room.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high- amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.",

      "content": "arXiv:2506.04536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.",

      "content": "arXiv:2502.21142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.",

      "title": "Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.24709v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.24647v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for dyslexics.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.24029v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model.\n  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.",

      "title": "The Neuroprotective Effects of Ocimum gratissimum-Supplemented Diet on Scopolamine-Induced Memory Impairment in Mice Model of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Background: Cognitive decline is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative illness primarily caused by the buildup of amyloid plaque, which is brought on by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Currently, therapeutic agents are focused on addressing clinical symptoms with associated side effects. This study aims to explore the neuroprotective potential of Ocimum gratissimum, a plant known for its richness in bioactive compounds. By investigating its effects on cognitive health, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding dietary interventions for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Thirty-six animals were divided into six groups of six mice each: the control group received distilled water intraperitoneally; the scopolamine group received only scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); the three test groups were fed 5%, 10%, and 20% Ocimum gratissimum-supplemented diets while also receiving scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); and the positive control group received Donepezil (5 mg/kg) followed by the injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.). Donepezil was administered orally 30 minutes before the scopolamine injection. All treatments were administered daily for 14 consecutive days. Results: The supplemented diet groups showed significantly improved spatial memory and navigation compared to the scopolamine-only group. Biochemical analyses revealed that O. gratissimum mitigated scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, with marked improvements in antioxidant enzyme levels, reduced lipid peroxidation, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: Dietary intervention using Ocimum gratissimum leaf was able to improve spatial memory and protect against memory impairment, suggesting its potential as a neuroprotective agent against Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.",

      "content": "Small vessel disease (SVD) impacts healthy aging of organs across the body, yet its contributions to adverse brain aging remain poorly defined. Here we show thromboinflammation, a core feature of SVD, as a driver of adverse brain aging. We identify cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen as a marker of brain thromboinflammation and screen neurovascular biosignatures mediating its impact on synaptic vulnerability along the full spectrum of brain aging from cognitively typical, amyloid-negative to cognitively impaired, amyloid-positive older adults. We identified 53 proteins mediating the effect of fibrinogen on synaptic markers in 1,655 donors from three independent cohorts. Single-cell transcriptomic mapping revealed mediator enrichment in neurovascular unit cells. Pathway analysis demonstrated dysregulation of angiogenesis, fibrosis, and immune signaling. Vascular and microglial-enriched biosignatures associated with compromised white matter integrity. These findings implicate thromboinflammation as an early, amyloid-independent pathway to neurodegeneration and tauopathy, establishing vascular health as fundamental to preserving brain healthspan.",

      "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",
