      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Sex-specific regulation of social play in juvenile rats by oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus and oxytocin signaling in the nucleus accumbens",
      "content": "Social play is a rewarding behavior shown across juvenile mammalian species and is important for the development of social competency throughout the lifespan. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) regulates various social behaviors and is being used in clinical trials to improve social competency. However, the role of OXT in juvenile social play is largely unknown. To address this gap, we determined the involvement of hypothalamic OXT-producing neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN), PVNOXT projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and OXT signaling within the NAc, in the regulation of social play in juvenile male and female rats. We found that neither chemogenetic stimulation of SONOXT cell bodies nor PVNOXT projections to the NAc altered the expression of juvenile social play but instead increased social investigation. However, chemogenetic stimulation of PVNOXT cell bodies as well as intra-NAc infusion of OXT decreased social play in males without an effect in females. Lastly, social play duration correlated negatively with the proportion of activated NAcOXTR neurons, an effect driven by males. Together, these findings suggest that distinct OXT neuronal populations modulate different forms of social behavior and that PVNOXT neurons and NAc-OXT signaling sex-specifically modulate social play behavior.",

      "title": "Modelling Auditory Enhancement: Efferent Control of Cochlear Gain can Explain Level Dependence and Effects of Hearing Loss",
      "content": "The role of medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent gain control in auditory enhancement (AE) was investigated using a subcortical auditory model. AE refers to the influence of a precursor on detectability of targets. The absence (or presence) of a precursor component at the target frequency enhances (or suppresses) detection under simultaneous masking conditions. Furthermore, the enhanced target under simultaneous masking acts as a stronger forward masker for a delayed probe tone, known as AE under forward masking. Psychoacoustic studies of AE report findings that challenge conventional expectations, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, listeners with hearing impairment have AE under simultaneous masking but not forward masking (Kreft et al., 2018; Kreft and Oxenham, 2019), whereas listeners with normal hearing have level-dependent AE under forward masking (Kreft and Oxenham, 2019). Our model with MOC efferent gain control successfully replicated these findings. In contrast, a model without efferent gain control failed to capture these effects, supporting the hypothesis that MOC-mediated cochlear gain modulation may play a role in AE and its alteration by hearing loss.",

      "title": "Topological basal ganglia model with dopamine-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity reproduces reinforcement learning, discriminatory learning, and neuropsychiatric disorders",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) are central to action selection and reinforcement learning, yet how the topological organization of the BG circuit with dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptors shape learning remains unclear. We present a topologically organized spiking model of macaque BG with cortico-striatal inputs organized into competing channels, D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs), three-factor DA modulated STDP for cortical synapses, asymmetric intra-striatal collaterals, and partially overlapping direct/indirect pathways. We validate resting activity and action selection, then study conditioning and generalization discrimination learning using DA bursts (CS+) and dips (CS). Two structural determinants emerged. First, pathway overlap ({lambda} ) trades off selection efficiency and learning speed: higher overlap degrades GPi-based selection efficiency during conditioning, yet accelerates convergence during discrimination by strengthening D2 influence on GPi. Second, lateral inhibition from MSN-D2 to MSNs ({kappa}) helps constrain competing actions but is not sufficient alone; robust discrimination requires DA dip dependent up modulation of D2 collateral efficacy (), which speeds and, at low overlap, enables convergence. Simulations under Parkinsonian and schizophrenia-like settings showed different deficits. A hypodopaminergic Parkinsonian STDP regime (D1 LTP loss, D2 LTD loss) impaired conditioning and failed to enhance discrimination. In contrast, attenuated D2 plasticity during DA dips (modeling methamphetamine-induced changes/schizophrenia-related dysregulation) selectively disrupted discrimination while sparing conditioning. Finally, we demonstrate efficient scaling on the Fugaku supercomputer to rodent and non human primate relevant sizes, supporting large scale, biologically grounded BG simulations. Together, the results highlight how pathway overlap and D2 collateral dynamics jointly regulate the speed and reliability of discrimination learning, and how specific DA perturbations map to distinct learning impairments.",

      "title": "Early life adversity increases striatal dopamine D1 receptor density and promotes social alcohol drinking in mice, especially males",
      "content": "The brain's reward circuitry remains sensitive to experience throughout early life and into adulthood, allowing individuals to adapt to their unique environments. Adverse experiences early in life can increase vulnerability to substance use disorders, likely through alterations to this circuitry. Yet, the precise neurobiological mechanisms by which early life adversity acts are incompletely characterized. In this study, we used a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm as a translationally relevant model of early life adversity in isogenic C57BL/6J mice. After LBN-rearing, we assessed the lasting behavioral and neurobiological impacts of this experience in adulthood. In robust sample sizes, our results validated previous findings of increased risk avoidance, enhanced acute response to alcohol, and greater voluntary alcohol drinking in socially-housed LBN-reared mice, especially males. Further, using autoradiography, we found LBN-reared mice had increased striatal D1-like receptor binding, skewing D1- to D2-like receptor balance relative to cross-fostered controls. However, after voluntary alcohol drinking, we found a strong downregulation in D1-like, and some D2-like, receptor binding, negating pre-existing differences in striatal dopamine receptor binding. We posit that via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, LBN-rearing upregulates striatal D1-receptor density and alters risk avoidance and acute alcohol stimulation to promote alcohol drinking among adversity-exposed mice. Together, these findings reveal specific neurobiological mechanisms that promote alcohol consumption following early life adversity and suggest complex interactions between early life adversity, sex-related factors, and dopamine receptor regulation in contributing to alcohol use disorder (AUD) vulnerability.",

      "content": "Amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and APOE4 represent two of the strongest pathological and genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how these co-pathogens interact during preclinical stages remains undefined. To address this, we developed a humanized knock-in mouse model expressing physiological, endogenously regulated human A{beta} and APOE4. Aged AppNL-F:APOE4 mice displayed incipient amyloidosis with subtle memory-related changes, consistent with preclinical AD. We found largely distinct, non-overlapping APOE4- and A{beta}-driven effects on synaptic function, sleep architecture, and exploratory behavior. However, at the transcriptomic level, APOE4 x A{beta} had a pronounced interaction in neuronal populations, whereas glial populations were primarily affected by either genotype alone. Within neurons, APOE4 x A{beta} interactions converged on a lysosomal-ER proteostasis axis across both excitatory and inhibitory cell types. These findings suggest that APOE4 x A{beta} interaction generates an early neuronal vulnerability signature that precedes overt functional decline. The AppNL-F:APOE4 knock-in model provides a physiologically relevant platform for studying early pathogenic mechanisms in AD.",

It would be awesome to get some other users to check it out and provide critical feedback to improve the tool for the open source community to make simple and elegant resumes without having to pay for it through a resume generation site.</p> <p>What My Project Does:</p> <p>This is a CLI tool which allows for defining resume content in a single YAML file and then generating PDF, HTML, or LaTeX rendered resumes from it. The idea is to write the configuration once, then be able to render it in a variety of different iterations.</p> <p>Target Audience:</p> <p>Jobseekers, students, academia</p> <p>Comparison:</p> <p>pyresume generates latex, has not been updated in 8 years</p> <p>resume-parser appears to be out of date as well, 5 years since most recent update</p> <p>resume-markdown has been recently updated and closely matches the goals of this project; there are some differentiators between resume-markdown and this project from a ease of use perspective where the default CSS/HTML doesn't require much modification to output a nice looking resume out of the box. I'd like to support more default style themes to expand upon this.</p> <p>Some key details:</p> <p>It comes with a few templates and color schemes that you can customize.</p> <p>For academic use, the LaTeX output gives you precise typesetting control.</p> <p>There's a Python API if you want to generate resumes programmatically.
