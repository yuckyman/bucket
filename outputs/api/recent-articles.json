      "title": "The Role of Temporal Factors in Processing Rapid Serial Visual Presentations",
      "content": "Sequentially presented visual stimuli are often employed to investigate the temporal limits of our visual perception and attention. Due to the finite nature of the brains' processing capacity, experimental designs attempt to increase temporal separation within series to mitigate potential neural interference between stimuli. This is achieved through shortening of stimulus durations and lengthening of interstimulus intervals. Across two experiments, we parametrically varied these parameters for a serially presented checkerboard wedge stimulus and used inverted encoding modelling to assess the fidelity of the neural representation of spatial location. We found longer interstimulus intervals and shorter stimulus durations produced the most reliable decoding. Varying interstimulus interval altered the fidelity of neural representations via inter-item interference. By contrast, the influence of stimulus duration seemed largely analytic; in a fixed duration block, shorter stimulus duration enabled more presentations, which led to increased decoding accuracy. Distinct anticipatory and reactionary neural events were observed for stimuli presented in triplet sequences, which seemed consistent with forwards and backwards visual masking. The absence of an anticipatory event was observed when backward masking was stronger while a reactionary event was present for every stimulus subjected to forward masking.",

      "title": "Cross-species etiologically informed stratification enables T cell receptor-based diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease",
      "content": "Developing peripheral blood-based diagnostic models for idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), particularly those leveraging the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, has long been considered infeasible because patient-derived TCRs appear to lack convergent sequence motifs. We reasoned that this apparent absence of shared TCR features likely reflects both insufficient sample sizes and unaccounted immune heterogeneity within the iPD population. To overcome these barriers, we reconstructed TCR repertoires from the two largest iPD cohorts currently available and used three mechanistically distinct mouse models as etiologically informed anchors to molecularly stratify patients. Within these data-driven subtypes, we trained subtype-specific, multimodal multi-instance classifiers, achieving Area Under Curve (AUC) exceeding 0.8 for both subtypes. Our findings underscore the critical role of disease stratification in enabling TCR repertoire-based modeling in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",

      "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
      "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, we\u2019re Sid and Ritvik, co-founders of Pulse. Pulse is a document extraction system to create LLM-ready text. We built Pulse as we realized that although modern vision language models are very good at producing plausible text, that makes them risky for OCR and data ingestion at scale.<p>When we started working on document extraction, we assumed the same thing many teams do today: foundation models were improving quickly, multi modal systems appeared to read documents well, and for small or clean inputs that assumption often held. The limitations showed up once we began processing real documents in volume. Long PDFs, dense tables, mixed layouts, low-fidelity scans, and financial or operational data exposed errors that were subtle, hard to detect, and expensive to correct. Outputs often looked reasonable while containing small but meaningful mistakes, especially in tables and numeric fields.<p>A lot of our work since then has been applied research. We run controlled evaluations on complex documents, fine tune vision models, and build labeled datasets where ground truth actually matters. There have been many nights where our team stayed up hand annotating pages, drawing bounding boxes around tables, labeling charts point by point, or debating whether a number was unreadable or simply poorly scanned. That process shaped our intuition far more than benchmarks alone.<p>One thing became clear quickly. The core challenge was not extraction itself, but confidence. Vision language models embed document images into high-dimensional representations optimized for semantic understanding rather than precise transcription. That process is inherently lossy. When uncertainty appears, models tend to resolve it using learned priors instead of surfacing ambiguity. This behavior can be helpful in consumer settings. In production pipelines, it creates verification problems that do not scale well.<p>Pulse grew out of trying to address this gap through system design rather than prompting alone. Instead of treating document understanding as a single generative step, the system separates layout analysis from language modeling. Documents are normalized into structured representations that preserve hierarchy and tables before schema mapping occurs. Extraction is constrained by schemas defined ahead of time, and extracted values are tied back to source locations so uncertainty can be inspected rather than guessed away. In practice, this results in a hybrid approach that combines traditional computer vision techniques, layout models, and vision language models, because no single approach handled these cases reliably on its own.<p>We are intentionally sharing a few documents that reflect the types of inputs that motivated this work. These are representative of cases where we saw generic OCR or VLM-based pipelines struggle.<p>Here is a financial 10K:\n<a href=\"https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example1\">https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example1</a><p>Here is a newspaper:\n<a href=\"https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example2\">https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example2</a><p>Here is a rent roll: <a href=\"https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example3\">https://platform.runpulse.com/dashboard/examples/example3</a><p>Pulse is not perfect, particularly on highly degraded scans or uncommon handwriting, and there is still room for improvement. The goal is not to eliminate errors entirely, but to make them visible, auditable, and easier to reason about.<p>Pulse is available via usage-based access to the API and platform You can try it here and access the API docs here.<p>Demo link here: <a href=\"https://video.runpulse.com/video/pulse-platform-walkthrough-69f9\">https://video.runpulse.com/video/pulse-platform-walkthrough-...</a><p>We\u2019re interested in hearing how others here evaluate correctness for document extraction, which failure modes you have seen in practice, and what signals you rely on to decide whether an output can be trusted. We will be around to answer questions and are happy to run additional documents if people want to share examples.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46313930\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46313930</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
