      "title": "Impact of early locus coeruleus lesions in the TgF344 Alzheimer's disease rat model",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION: In murine models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), lesioning the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system with DSP-4 exacerbates AD-like neuropathology and cognitive impairment. However, the impact of LC lesions during prodromal stages is poorly characterized. METHODS: TgF344-AD and wild-type rats received monthly injections of DSP-4 or saline from 1-5 months of age, a time point preceding forebrain plaque or tangle deposition in TgF344-AD rats, after which behavior and pathology were assessed. RESULTS: DSP-4 compromised LC cell bodies, fibers, and NE content. LC lesion and the AD transgene each affected several affective behaviors and/or cognition individually, but few interactions were found and DSP-4 failed to exacerbate behavioral phenotypes or neuropathology in TgF344-AD rats. DISCUSSION: Combined with previous literature, our data suggest that LC lesions exacerbate pre-existing AD-like pathology and behavioral impairments, rather than accelerate their onset. Further characterization of LC lesions in TgF344-AD rats at different ages is warranted.",

      "title": "Brain lipidomics identifies mitochondrial redox dysfunction and metabolic trade-offs associated with Parkinsons disease-like pathology induced by Nanoplastics exposure",
      "content": "Growing nanoplastics exposure raises concern for neurotoxicity, particularly given recent evidence of plastic accumulation within human brain tissue- a highly lipid enriched organ, yet effects on brain lipid metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we employed high-resolution untargeted lipidomics to map brain lipid perturbations in Drosophila melanogaster chronically exposed to environmentally relevant levels of polystyrene nanoplastics (NPs). Polystyrene NPs accumulated in fly brains and induced dose-dependent remodeling of mitochondrial membrane lipids, notably cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamines, accompanied by increased diacylglycerols/triacylglycerols and monounsaturated fatty acids and by lipid-droplet expansion. Guided by these lipidomic signatures, targeted biochemical assays demonstrated depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated mitochondrial reactive-oxygen species, inhibition of respiratory-chain complexes I and IV, and a shift in NAD(H) and NADP(H) redox couples toward a reduced state and increasing lipid peroxidation. This redox imbalance was accompanied by decreased tyrosine-hydroxylase expression, dopamine depletion, and impaired locomotor behavior, hallmarks of PD-like neurodegeneration. Dopaminergic neurochemistry was impaired (tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine decreased), with concomitant reduction of GABA, and locomotor and circadian deficits emerged. Remarkbly, co-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) restored mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxidation, normalized neutral lipid and MUFA accumulation, and rescued neurotransmitter levels and behavior. Stable-isotope tracing confirmed disrupted TCA cycle flux after NP exposure that was rescued by NAC. Collectively, these findings reveal lipidomic remodeling as a critical link between environmental nanoplastic exposure and PD-like pathology, highlighting mitochondrial redox lipid interactions as early determinants and support redox-directed interventions to mitigate risk.",

      "title": "Increased levels of HAPLN2, which anchors dense extracellular matrix, in the hippocampus of APOE4 targeted replacement mice",
      "content": "Hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2) / Brain link protein-1 (Bral1) is important for the binding of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) to hyaluronan and thus for the formation of specific types of brain extracellular matrix (ECM). It is also significantly increased with aging. Machine learning has also identified it as a brain-derived protein most predictive of Alzheimers disease (AD). HAPLN2 binds to CSPGs that may sequester aggregation-prone proteins and also restrict neuronal plasticity. Apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) allele increases AD risk and thus in the present study we have examined hippocampal lysates from APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement (TR) mice using unbiased proteomics as well as Western blot and hippocampal immunostaining. Proteomics data show that HAPLN2 is among the most significantly upregulated proteins in APOE4 mice. Prior work suggests HAPLN2 is particularly important to the assembly of perinodal matrix. Herein we show that it also co-localizes with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) positive perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs represent a dense form of ECM that can increase GABAergic neurotransmission to alter overall excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and neuronal oscillations important to mood and memory. Proteomics also detected elevated levels of high temperature requirement peptidase-1 (HTRA1). HTRA1 accumulates in cerebral blood vessels harboring amyloid in APOE4 mice. Western blot studies of lysates from APOE4 mice also showed significantly reduced levels chondroitin-6 sulfated proteoglycans. This change makes PNNs more susceptible to proteolysis and less inhibitory. Immunostaining studies further showed that levels of the PNN component aggrecan were increased in the hippocampus of APOE4 animals. Overall these findings contribute to an emerging body of literature suggesting that brain extracellular matrix may be altered with aging and other risk factors for AD. Findings also suggest that future studies should assess peri-nodal structure and axonal conduction in the background of APOE4.",

      "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
      "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "content": "Objective. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the convolutional spider neural network (CS-Net), combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy, to classify hybrid gestures that integrate wrist postures and hand movements. Approach. The CS-Net framework incorporates diverse surface electromyography (sEMG) features, including raw signals and FFT representations, through a multi-stream information fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance. The proposed TL strategy involves pre-training the model on specific wrist postures and fine-tuning it on the full set of hybrid gestures, leveraging the intrinsic relationships between composite gestures and their constituent movements to improve accuracy. The framework is evaluated through extensive offline experiments using a dataset of 12 hybrid gestures (combining three wrist postures and four hand movements) collected from six subjects, comparing its performance against three deep learning algorithms in sEMG recognition filed. Main results. The average experimental result for the proposed CS-Net with TL reached 90.6%. Additionally, its generalization ability is validated with the Ninapro public databases, which are DB1, DB4, and DB5. The 30 action classification accuracy of CS-Net on the Ninapro datasets was 68.7%, 61.5% and 66.3%, respectively. To demonstrate practical applicability, real-time online experiments involving object grasping tasks is conducted, achieving a success rate of 90%. Significance. The results show that CS-Net significantly improves sEMG classification accuracy, while the TL strategy further enhances performance. Moreover, the algorithm achieved a high success rate in online experiments, confirming its robustness and practical utility for real-world applications. Our hybrid gesture dataset and source codes are available on Github.",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
