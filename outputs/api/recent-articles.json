      "title": "Hemodynamic and electrophysiological progression of the Rose Bengal photothrombotic stroke model in mice: vasoactive properties of Rose Bengal, tissue heating, wavelength optimization, and sex differences in lesion volume",
      "content": "The photothrombotic stroke model is gaining popularity due to its relative simplicity, minimal invasiveness, and clinical relevance. Photothrombosis involves the delivery of an intravascular photosensitizer (Rose Bengal) followed by its photoactivation, resulting in vessel occlusion and ischemia. Using a combination of complementary optical and non-optical techniques, we characterized the physiological changes in mice undergoing photothrombosis. We report that Rose Bengal acts as a rapid vasoconstrictor, inducing hypoemia both in the brain and periphery even in the absence of its photoactivation. Conversely, we find that light, when used at photothrombosis-appropriate intensities and durations, induces large amounts of tissue heating and hyperemia even in the distal non-illuminated hemisphere. Furthermore, we show that use of the optimal photothrombotic wavelength based on the Rose Bengal absorption spectrum (yellow-561nm) produces a more consistent and pronounced drop in blood flow, and a shorter latency to the initial spreading depolarization (SD), ultimately resulting in a larger stroke. Similarly, when yellow light is used to induce a stroke in ChR2-expressing mice, the electrophysiological and hemodynamic confounds from green light cross activation of ChR2 are eliminated. Finally, we observe across cohorts that male mice have larger strokes than females. Altogether, we extensively describe important caveats and confounds concerning photothrombosis and provide a detailed characterization of its early ischemic events.",

      "title": "Exogenous spatial attention is functional in paralytic strabismics",
      "content": "IntroductionThe absence of exogenous cueing effects in patients with paralytic strabismus has been cited as evidence for an obligate linkage between movement execution and attentional allocation.MethodsThe present study challenges this interpretation through two experiments that measured the impact of visual cues, intended to facilitate or inhibit shifts of spatial attention, on the latencies of target-directed responses. By including a no-cue control condition, we assessed both the presence and direction of cue-induced attentional modulation.ResultsOur results show that all patients\u2019 patterns of saccadic (Experiment I) and keypress (Experiment II) response latencies showed classic signatures of cue-target interactions: movements initiated in response to targets spatially proximate to cues were initiated fastest whereas movements initiated toward targets spatially distal from cues were initiated slowest. This trend held true when grouping latencies by cue-saccade offset to account for small errors in saccade landing position in Experiment I. Though the patients\u2019 data exhibited small degrees of idiosyncrasy, most patients\u2019 mean normalized latencies also fell within the range of latencies observed in non-strabismic participants.DiscussionThese findings support the notion that premotor structures may program attentional shifts in an effector-independent manner and motivate future investigations to explore how, not if, exogenous spatial attention is deployed in paralytic strabismics.",

      "content": "Small object detection is an essential but challenging task in computer vision. Transformer-based algorithms have demonstrated remarkable performance in the domain of computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, they suffer from inadequate feature extraction for small objects. Additionally, they face difficulties in deployment on resource-constrained platforms due to their heavy computational burden. To tackle these problems, an efficient local-global fusion Transformer (ELFT) is proposed for small...",

      "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

      "title": "Early contingency information enhances human punishment sensitivity when punishment is frequent but not rare.",
      "content": "Individuals differ in sensitivity to the adverse consequences of their actions. We have shown that these differences can be linked to differences in correctly learning causal relationships between actions and their negative consequences. To further assess this, here we used a conditioned punishment task in 195 participants. Explicit punishment contingency information was provided before or after participants had experienced strong (40%) or weak (10%) punishment contingencies. We found the same phenotypes of human punishment learning reported previously (Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021; Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2023). Early provision of punishment contingency information promoted punishment avoidance under strong punishment contingencies but was relatively ineffective under weak punishment contingencies. This persistent punishment insensitivity despite early contingency information was not due to habit learning or failure to understand the associative task structure. Rather, persistent insensitivity to punishment was due to a failure in integrating punishment contingency knowledge with action selection.

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation of nucleus basalis of meynert: Effect of stimulation mode and duration on learning in rat model of dementia.",
      "content": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has been preliminarily investigated as a potential treatment for dementia. The degeneration of NBM cholinergic neurons is a pathological feature of many forms of dementia. Although NBM stimulation has been demonstrated to improve learning, the ideal parameters for NBM stimulation have not been elucidated. This study assesses the differential effects of varying stimulation patterns and duration on learning in a dementia rat model with cholinergic deficits. 192-IgG saporin (SAP) or Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate buffered saline was injected into the NBM to produce dementia in rats. Next, all rats underwent unilateral implantation of a DBS electrode in the NBM. The experimental groups consisted of (a) normal, (b) untreated SAP-injected rats with cholinergic deficits, and (c) SAP rats receiving NBM DBS. The stimulation paradigms included testing different modes (tonic and burst) and durations (1 hr, 5 hr, and 24 hr/day) over 10 daily sessions. Memory was assessed using two established learning paradigms: novel object recognition and auditory operant chamber learning. Both normal and stimulated rats demonstrated improved performance in novel object recognition and auditory learning as compared to the unstimulated SAP group. The burst stimulation groups performed better than the tonic group. Increasing the daily stimulation duration to 24 hr did not further improve cognitive performance in an auditory recognition task and degraded the results on a novel object recognition task as compared with 5 hr. The present findings suggest that naturalistic NBM burst DBS may offer potential effective therapy for treating dementia and suggests potential strategies for the reevaluation of current human NBM stimulation paradigms.

      "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
      "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).
