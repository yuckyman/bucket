      "title": "A deformable attractor manifold organizes human resting-state brain dynamics",
      "content": "Intrinsic brain activity is often described as wandering within a continuous multivariate space, yet the organizing principles that constrain these dynamics remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous human brain activity during rest is structured by a deformable attractor manifold. Using large-scale fMRI datasets and a latent dynamical model, we find that cortical activity occupies two reproducible regimes: a low-coherence state with a unimodal latent distribution and a high-coherence state that exhibits bimodality, consistent with transient bistability across association networks. A compact two-parameter energy landscape explains these dynamics, revealing that transitions arise not from switching between discrete states, but from continuous deformation of the manifold that reshapes attractor geometry. Excursions into the bistable regime occur as rapid \"jumps\", whereas returns follow slow drifts along the manifold, reflecting network-specific timescales. Individuals with greater expression of the bistable regime show higher cognitive fluidity, and manifold parameters differentiate mild cognitive impairment from matched controls. These findings identify an organizing geometric and dynamical principle of resting activity, linking large-scale cortical coordination, cognitive variability, and vulnerability to pathology.",

      "title": "DNM2-CMT neuropathy stems from disrupted Schwann cell function and shows limited therapeutic reversibility",
      "content": "Dominant loss-of-function mutations in DNM2 cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy characterized by sensory and motor deficits associated with myelin and/or axonal abnormalities and muscle atrophy. Increasing DNM2 activity from embryogenesis has been reported to ameliorate neuromuscular phenotypes in the Dnm2K562E/+ CMT mouse; however, this model displays predominantly muscle pathology and limited nerve involvement, precluding rigorous evaluation of neuropathic mechanisms and potential therapies. Here, we performed comprehensive behavioral, electrophysiological, histological and molecular analyses to characterize the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse, which combines systemic heterozygosity for the common K562E mutation together with Schwann cell (SC)-specific deletion of wild-type Dnm2. This model faithfully reproduces key clinical and pathological features of DNM2-CMT, including motor deficits, reduced general force and coordination, and severe sensory and motor conduction deficits associated with axonal loss, demyelination, and inflammation. Mechanistically, we delineate a coherent pathological sequence that explains the profound functional deficits. In particular, a downregulation of the transcription factor EGR2, a master regulator of myelin gene expression, and of the myelin protein MPZ correlates with demyelination. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of DNM2 supplementation, post-symptomatic intrathecal delivery of AAV9-DNM2 driven by the Schwann cell-specific MPZ promoter was performed at 4 weeks. Although DNM2 expression increased in peripheral nerves (~1.9-fold), no significant improvements were observed across behavioural, electrophysiological, structural, or molecular parameters. Together, these findings establish the Dnm2K562E/SC- mouse as a robust preclinical model, recapitulating key features of DNM2-CMT, and provides crucial insight into the biological and temporal constraints that must guide future therapeutic strategies for DNM2-CMT.",

      "title": "Astrocyte senescence impairs synaptogenesis due to Thrombospondin-1 loss.",
      "content": "Cellular senescence is an irreversible state linked to aging that involves molecular and functional alterations. The mammalian hippocampus, a key brain region for learning and memory, is highly vulnerable to damage in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, yet the role of cellular senescence in hippocampal aging remains underexplored. Here, we report an early onset of senescence signatures in hippocampal astrocytes of the accelerated aging and frailty mouse model SAMP8. We examine how astrocyte senescence affects excitatory synapse formation, focusing on soluble signals released by astrocytes. Astrocytes isolated from SAMP8 brain and those differentiated from SAMP8 neural stem cells show senescence hallmarks (SA-{beta}-gal, p16INK4a, Lamin B1 loss), alongside a significant reduction in synaptogenic function. While astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) from control mice promotes excitatory synaptogenesis through thrombospondin-1 / 2{delta}-1 neuronal receptor signalling, ACM from senescent SAMP8 astrocytes lacks this capacity. Supplementing senescent ACM with thrombospondin-1 protein, or overexpressing thrombospondin-1 gene in senescent astrocytes, reinstates synaptogenesis. At the hippocampal level, thrombospondin-1 and synaptic puncta are reduced in SAMP8 mice. Our findings reveal that senescent astrocytes exhibit reduced synaptogenic capacity due to thrombospondin-1 loss, highlighting their contribution to synaptic dysfunction during aging. Preventing senescence in hippocampal astrocytes may thus restore astrocyte-mediated synaptogenesis in the aged brain.",

      "title": "Selective impairment of spatial recognition memory and reduced frontal corticothalamic spine density following adolescent alcohol consumption",
      "content": "Heavy alcohol use is common during adolescence and is associated with increased risk of alcohol use disorder and prevalence of residual cognitive deficits, especially in behaviors associated with the latently developing prefrontal cortex (PFC). A major need for advancing our understanding of this relationship is replicable and accessible preclinical behavioral batteries that can be used to disassociate the effects of adolescent alcohol on select PFC circuits. Electrophysiological evidence implicates projections from the PFC to mediodorsal thalamus (PFC-MdT) as being uniquely impacted by adolescent intermittent alcohol consumption in mice. The present study aims to evaluate if voluntary consumption of alcohol during adolescence impacts anxiety or PFC-associated spatial and recognition memory and if they are associated with morphological changes to the PFC-MdT circuit. Our results indicate that compared to water-only controls, male and female mice that voluntarily consumed alcohol during adolescence demonstrate performance deficits in the object-in-place recognition task, without affecting the novel object recognition task, Y-maze alternation, anxiety or locomotion, an outcome consistent with PFC and MdT dysfunction. Morphological assessment of PFC neurons from male and female mice following behavioral tasks found a reduction in spine density in basal and apical, but not oblique dendrites of PFC-MdT neurons. Collectively, these results implicate the PFC to MdT circuit integrity as a potential locus of the effects of adolescent alcohol on spatial recognition memory.",

      "title": "Launch HN: Browser Buddy (YC W24) \u2013 A recommendation system for Internet writing",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Arnav and Jeremy and we're building Browser Buddy, a recommendation system you can chat with to find quality Internet writing based on your interests and aspirations.<p>As we've grown up, this writing was a source of inspiration that helped us discover ideas and opportunities we didn't even know we were looking for (ex. applying to YC because of PG's essays).<p>But despite so many new creators and websites coming online, the best of the open Internet remains hard-to-find, scattered across personal sites (<a href=\"https://www.paulgraham.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.paulgraham.com/</a>, <a href=\"https://www.eugenewei.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.eugenewei.com/</a>), niche publications (<a href=\"https://www.noemamag.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.noemamag.com/</a>, <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://worksinprogress.co/</a>), and various independent publishing platforms (<a href=\"https://bearblog.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bearblog.dev/</a>, <a href=\"https://substack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://substack.com/</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://medium.com/</a>). Outside of \"social\" media platforms, there's very high friction to get into a new subject or stumble upon credible people who write about your interests.<p>We feel there should be an easier (and mobile-friendly) way to find fantastic media and curate this intentional, interesting information diet for yourself.<p>Browser Buddy is an iOS app that curates this interesting, thought-provoking writing for you from across the Internet. It's particularly good to explore topics like programming, startups, math, philosophy, machine learning, and design.<p>Here's a demo: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmEeo4mjc7U\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmEeo4mjc7U</a><p>Here are some example recommendations:<p>\"I'm trying to grow my early stage consumer internet company\":\n<a href=\"https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the...</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-the-biggest-consumer-apps-got\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-the-biggest-consumer-...</a><p>\"I want to learn how to build beautiful web interfaces\":\n<a href=\"https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/</a>\n<a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/</a><p>\"Teach me the history of the Internet\":\n<a href=\"https://www.mic.com/impact/how-geocities-webrings-made-the-90s-internet-a-cozier-place-19638198\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mic.com/impact/how-geocities-webrings-made-the-9...</a>\n<a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/blog/history-of-the-future-october-29-1969-fifty-years-of-a-connected-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://computerhistory.org/blog/history-of-the-future-octob...</a><p>\"I'm trying to read more about games and game theory\":\n<a href=\"https://franklantz.substack.com/p/playing-balatro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://franklantz.substack.com/p/playing-balatro</a>\n<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/03/16/on-expected-utility-part-1-skyscrapers-and-madmen\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/03/16/on-expected-utility-part...</a><p>\"I've been getting into network science and network theory\":\n<a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/10/27/warrens-plazas-and-the-edge-of-legibility/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/10/27/warrens-plazas-and-the...</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/seeing-like-a-network\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/seeing-like-a-network</a><p>We trained a language model to recommend webpages how people do through hyperlinks. Hyperlinks can be an expressive way to describe a webpage (<a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/07/01/the-rhetoric-of-the-hyperlink/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/07/01/the-rhetoric-of-the-hy...</a>), but there's a lot of spam and low-quality linking online that would serve as bad training examples. We found the structure of the link graph to still be a fantastic way to understand what content is salient, and used it heavily to filter and build our dataset. The resulting model is best for expressive, exploratory queries where you describe what you are looking for (like a prompt to an LLM) rather than entering in keywords (like a search on Google). This model is the main \"curation\" step in our system that picks from our index of ~150 million (and growing) webpages.<p>We built Browser Buddy to try and recreate the feeling of getting a thoughtful recommendation from a smart friend. Our early users have described it as a \"refreshing stream of timely and timeless writing\", \"serendipitous discovery\", \"rabbit holes that feel joyfully unfunneled\". We are iterating on the concept and how it's presented, but we really value the HN community and would love to hear what you all think:<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/browser-buddy/id6752281959\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/browser-buddy/id6752281959</a><p>Thank you for your time and being a part of the Internet we love!<p>Jeremy (jeremy@browserbuddy.com) and Arnav (arnav@browserbuddy.com)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46149727\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46149727</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Signatures of remote planning in hippocampal replay",
      "content": "During brief, intermittent \"replay\" events, hippocampal activity can express navigational trajectories disconnected from both when and where they originally occurred. While replay biased toward immediate future goals has been observed, there is no evidence yet linking replay to planning beyond the next action. Here, we designed a sequential spatial working memory task which required rats to utilize information across multiple temporally separated actions. Remote replay events matched the animal's future navigational choices made after completing an intervening subtask. Critically, this occurred only when the replayed information was useful for reducing memory load, consistent with it being an active process. Our findings suggest these remote replay events are a neural correlate of episodic forethought, allowing animals to use memories to plan beyond their immediate surroundings.",
