      "title": "Dysregulation of energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis in iPSC-derived neurons carrying Presenilin-1 M146L gene mutation",
      "content": "Impaired cellular activities, particularly in highly active cells such as neurons, are primarily supported by metabolic abnormalities and failures in Ca2+; homeostasis. Here, we provide an integrative analysis of human iPSC-derived neurons (iNs) carrying the Presenilin-1 M146L gene mutation (PS1M146L) and control cells (PS1control). PS1M146L iNs exhibited abnormal Ca2+; dynamics, a significant increase in key parameters of mitochondrial respiration, and higher intracellular ROS levels. KCl-evoked depolarisation was significantly lower in PS1M146L, suggesting a failure in maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane. Following thapsigargin stimulation, mitochondrial Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]m) were significantly reduced in PS1M146L, while [Ca2+]m did not differ significantly between genotypes after treatment with bradykinin, suggesting that impairments in the [Ca2+]m homeostasis are particularly evident under stress conditions and do not impact the 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) pathway. Since iNs of both genotypes were sensitive to the MCU-1 inhibitor, the deficits observed in PS1M146L could be the consequence of impairments in the ER-mitochondria contacts. Our results illustrate the utility of iNs carrying PS1 mutations in understanding how human neurons alter relevant pathways before neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Maximized field-of-view deep-brain calcium imaging through gradient-index lenses",
      "content": "Advances in genetically encoded fluorescent indicators have enabled increasingly sensitive optical recordings of neural activity. However, light scattering in the mammalian brain tissue restricts optical access to deeper regions. To address this limitation, researchers often employ implanted gradient-index (GRIN) lenses to reach deep brain areas. Nevertheless, the severe optical aberrations of GRIN lenses significantly reduce the effective field of view (FOV). In this work, we present a simple and robust imaging approach that combines low-NA telecentric scanning (LNTS) of laser excitation with high-NA fluorescence collection to increase the FOV. This configuration effectively eliminates common aberrations such as astigmatism and field curvature, resulting in a FOV ~100% as large as the GRIN lens facet area ?corresponding to a ~400% increase in imaging area compared with conventional approaches. We validate this method through both structural and functional in vivo imaging. The highly consistent imaging performance, fully maximized imaging FOV, and the very simple optical design make this method well-suited for broad dissemination in neuroscience research.",

      "title": "Granularity of thalamic head direction cells",
      "content": "Head direction signaling is fundamental for spatial orientation and navigation. The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (ADn) contains a high density of head direction (HD) cells that process sensorimotor inputs for subsequent synaptic integration in postsynaptic cortical areas. We tested the hypothesis that individual HD cells show differences in their firing patterns and connectivity by recording and juxtacellularly labeling single HD cells in subregions of the ADn in awake mice during passive rotation. We identified HD cells that exhibited different response profiles to light, sound, and movement. We also identified a mediolateral gradient of calretinin-expressing (CR+) ADn cells, with CR+ HD cells having narrower tuning widths, lower maximal firing rates, and different intrinsic properties compared to CR- cells. Axons of labeled HD cells could be followed to the retrosplenial cortex, with collaterals innervating the thalamic reticular nucleus (type I cells); others additionally innervated the dorsomedial striatum (type II cells). Most medial CR+ cells preferentially projected to ventral retrohippocampal regions. Surprisingly, we also identified a subpopulation of medial CR+ cells with twisted dendrites and descending axons that avoided the thalamic reticular nucleus, termed tortuosa HD cells (type III cells). We conclude that HD cells of the mouse ADn comprise distinct cell types, providing parallel head-direction-modulated sensorimotor messages to synaptic target neurons within the head direction network.",

      "title": "Stage-specific extracellular vesicle cargo from Schwann cells orchestrates peripheral nerve regeneration",
      "content": "Schwann cells (SCs) play a critical role in peripheral nerve regeneration, undergoing dynamic phenotype transitioning from myelinating to repair stages following injury. While SC-derived extracellular vesicles (SC-EVs) have emerged as key mediators of intercellular communication during nerve repair, their stage-specific molecular cargo and functional roles remained incomplete understood. Here, we delineate protein, microRNA and lncRNA landscapes of SC-EVs across distinct differentiation stages, including immature, myelinating, and repair phenotypes, using an in vitro model of primary rat SCs. We show that myelinating SC-EVs are enriched with reprogramming factor SOX2 and neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, while repair SC-EVs carry distinct microRNAs predicted to modulate genes involved in myelin ensheathment, neuronal differentiation and neurogenesis. Moreover, repair SC-EVs contain long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that may regulate miRNA activity. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which SC-EVs orchestrate neuronal regeneration through stage-specific molecular cargo, and establishes a foundational model for investigating SC plasticity in peripheral nerve repair.",

      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

All participants underwent the allocated intervention (active or sham rTMS over the prefrontal cortex) and completed standardized balance and proprioceptive assessments both pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the neuromodulatory effects on proprioceptive function in ACLR patients. The alpha level for statistical significance was set at \u03c1\u202f\u2264\u202f0.05 a priori.ResultsIn the rTMS group, the Center of Pressure Area (COPA) and the Center of Pressure Sway (COPS) of the injured limb were significantly reduced before and after repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (p\u202f=\u202f0.002), and the 30\u00b0 positional sensory stimulation was significantly improved compared with the pre-stimulation period (p\u202f=\u202f0.012).ConclusionNeuro-enhancement technology can improve the proprioceptive performance of ACLR patients and thus improve their motor ability.",

      "content": "IntroductionMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid progression. Early diagnosis remains particularly challenging, especially when CASPR2 antibodies are detected during the early stages of disease progression.Case presentationA 56-year-old female presented with chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. Serum analysis revealed the presence of CASPR2 antibodies. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum. The external anal-sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG) indicated autonomic nerve dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. Despite treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, no clinical improvement was observed. During follow-up, symptoms of autonomic nerve dysfunction emerged, leading to a clinical established diagnosis of cerebellar subtype of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C).ConclusionIn the early stages of MSA, autonomic nerve dysfunction may not manifest clinically. Therefore, close follow-up is essential for accurate diagnosis. EAS-EMG exhibits high sensitivity in detecting subclinical autonomic dysfunction. Although the co-occurrence of MSA-C and high-titer (1:100) CASPR2-IgG is uncommon, this case highlights the critical importance of relying on the overall clinical presentation, rather than on isolated laboratory findings, to establish the primary diagnosis.",
