      "title": "Odor-induced Sustained Neural Activity during Memory Encoding",
      "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

      "title": "Social bodies: Preliminary evidence that awareness of embodied emotions is associated with recognition of emotions in the bodily cues of others.",
      "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.
