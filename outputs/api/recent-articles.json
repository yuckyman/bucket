      "title": "Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.04047v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.",

Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "title": "Intrinsic excitability controls structural plasticity of cerebellar climbing fibers",
      "content": "In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) convey a teaching signal to Purkinje cells (PCs) that is crucial for cerebellar learning. They undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity during development and learning, and their transverse branches have an activity-dependent control of mobility. The maintenance of their structure was shown to rely on the growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), which is highly expressed in these fibers under basal conditions in adults and which is controlled by intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation. Although activity-dependent structural plasticity occurs in several axonal fibers throughout the brain, it remains unclear whether this is also the case for the main branches of CFs. Here, we investigate this issue using in vivo knock-down of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) in the CF-generating neurons of the inferior olive, and analyzing CF three-dimensional morphology, density and function of synaptic contacts with PCs. We show that the decrease in intrinsic excitability causes a reduction in the number and length of CF branches and that similar effects are caused by the knockdown of GAP-43, suggesting that GAP-43 may mediate this response. We also show that the retraction of CF fibers is associated with a seemingly compensatory increase in the density of CF synaptic terminals and PC dendritic spines, specifically in the area where PCs receive CF inputs. These plastic modifications are associated with a decrease in paired-pulse ratio and an increase in the kinetics and transferred charge of synaptic currents. Our data show that CFs can undergo activity-dependent structural plasticity changes affecting synaptic transmission and suggest the possibility that they contribute to encoding memories in the cerebellum and, if disrupted, to the pathophysiology of cerebellar diseases.",

      "title": "Experience-Dependent Plasticity of Thalamoprefrontal Circuitry Characterizes Learning Across Species",
      "content": "Learning is an adaptive process which is thought to require precise coordination among multiple brain regions over time. Thalamoprefrontal circuitry is central to multiple domains of cognitive control and executive function, yet its evolution during learning is not characterized. In this study, we explored thalamoprefrontal circuit signaling in mice and connectivity dynamics in humans over the course of learning a homologous psychomotor task. In mice, we targeted a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator to the mediodorsal-prefrontal (MdT-dmPFC) projection and used fiber photometry to record synaptic dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activity. As learning sessions progressed, all mice demonstrated a decrease in reaction time (RT) performance on successful trials (p<0.001). In concomitant synaptic MdT-dmPFC circuit activity across sessions, we observed a significant increase in activity during the anticipatory (p<0.01) and reward retrieval (p<0.01) periods, and a non-significant trend towards an increase in preparatory activity (p<0.15). However, following the learning period, during task re-exposure, we observed a significant shift in circuit activity, away from anticipatory (p<0.001) and towards the preparatory period (p<0.001) over the course of re-exposure sessions. Furthermore, we observed an emergence of a learner (decrease in RT) and a non-learner group (increase in RT) during the task re-exposure period. Over the course of a single analogous task session in humans, we also observed a learner and a non-learner group. When analyzing the thalamoprefrontal regional connectivity dynamics of early and late trials for learners, we observed a significant increase in low frequency and decrease in high frequency synchrony (connectivity tilt) in thalamoprefrontal pathways during preparatory and anticipatory periods. Interestingly, pairwise interactions specifically between the anterior corona radiata (ACR) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the human homolog to the genetically targeted MdT-dmPFC circuitry in mice, in fact demonstrated a robustly opposite connectivity tilt effect distinguishing learners from non-learners (Cohens d > 2). Overall, these findings may provide cross-species evidence of novel, conserved thalamoprefrontal circuit mechanisms of adaptive learning.",

      "title": "Social Processing in the Amygdala: Single-Nucleus RNA-Sequencing Reveals Distinct Neuronal Responses to Dominant and Subordinate Cues",
      "content": "The amygdala serves as a critical neural hub for interpreting social cues, with its distinct subregions and diverse neuronal populations playing specialized roles in processing these signals. This study employs single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the amygdala's neuronal responses to olfactory cues associated with social dominance, uncovering distinct activation patterns within glutamatergic and GABAergic populations. We find that a glutamatergic cluster, characterized by expression patterns closely aligned with glutamatergic Slc17a7 (VGLUT1) medial amygdala (MeA) neurons, preferentially responds to dominant cues. In contrast, a larger glutamatergic Slc17a6 (VGLUT2) cluster associated with neurons of the MeA, as well as cortical and basomedial amygdala, exhibits a heightened response to subordinate cues, underscoring the MeA region's role in processing social olfactory information. Additionally, a glutamatergic cluster resembling dorsal endopririform (EPd) neurons responded more to dominant stimuli, supporting the EPd's role in olfactory perception. We also identified a GABAergic cluster with elevated dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2) expression that predominantly responds to dominant cues, consistent with this receptor's known role in mediating threat responses. Through gene co-expression network analysis, we linked gene expression within neuronal clusters to specific biological processes. These findings reveal distinct neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying social processing, particularly in response to dominant and subordinate olfactory signals, thus enhancing our understanding of the neural substrates of social behavior.",

      "title": "Role of Bassoon-mediated active zone integrity at different types of brain synapses for brain activity and cortex-dependent memory formation",
      "content": "Background: The properly controlled release of neurotransmitter at presynaptic active zones is crucial for brain function and performance. Bassoon is a major scaffolding protein involved in the organization of neurotransmitter release sites at excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory brain synapses. Global deficiency of functional Bassoon causes severe neurological conditions including disturbed patterns of brain activity and early-onset epilepsy. To distinguish the contribution of different types of synapses to this phenotype we generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking the Bsn gene in (i) GABAergic interneurons expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the Dlx5/6 regulatory elements (BsnDlx5/6 cKO), (ii) glutamatergic forebrain neurons expressing Cre under the Emx1 promoter (BsnEmx1 cKO), and (iii) dopaminergic neurons expressing DAT-driven Cre (BsnDAT). Methods: Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was employed to assess in vivo brain-wide activation patterns in the cKO mice and corresponding control animals with wildtype Bsn genes. A cortex-dependent learning task to discriminate frequency-modulated tones was then used to evaluate the cognitive abilities of the different cKO lines. Results: Marked reduction of brain activity was found in various cortical areas and the basolateral amygdala of BsnDlx5/6 cKO mice, while patches of increased activity were detected in the dorsal striatum. BsnEmx1 cKO mice, in contrast, display increased brain activity in many cortical areas. Only minor changes in CBF were detected in BsnDAT cKO mice. Concerning auditory discrimination learning BsnDlx5/6cKO mice were severely impaired, although they responded to stimuli normally. On the other hand, BsnEmx1 cKO mice acquired the task more efficiently reaching maximum performance levels faster than control animals. Surprisingly, BsnDATcKO mice did not differ in their behavior from the control group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that absence of Bassoon from presynapses of GABAergic interneurons expressing Dlx5/6 gene during development results in severe neurological symptoms and associated dysfunctions. Instead, network changes associated with Bassoon deficiency at glutamate release sites of excitatory forebrain neurons, even seem to have an enhancing effect on learning.",

      "title": "The brain architecture of punishment learning",
      "content": "Learning which actions cause harm is essential for survival, yet how the brain transforms this knowledge into adaptive control of behavior remains unclear. We combined whole-brain analysis, multisite chemogenetic silencing, spatial transcriptomics, and longitudinal calcium imaging to map how punishment learning reorganizes brain networks across scales. Learning reshaped mesoscale community organization into a network anchored by the amygdala, subthalamic hypothalamic zone, and ventral midbrain tegmentum. These regions contributed distinct components of adaptive avoidance and engaged diverse transcriptional programs across multiple neuronal subclasses. Within this network, the amygdala acted as a hub, partitioning action and outcome information and remapping neural geometry to segregate punished from safe actions. Together, these results identify a multiscale neural architecture through which aversive experience can be transformed into flexible behavioral control.",

      "title": "Distinct Roles of Deep and Superficial Cortical Layers in Tone Prediction, Comparison, and Adaptation in Human Auditory Cortex",
      "content": "Auditory perception relies on prior sensations both to form expectations about upcoming sounds and to adapt to repeated inputs. Yet, how these processes interact with bottom-up frequency-specific stimulus drive, and how they are organised across cortical depth, remains unclear. Using ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), participants listened to stochastic tone sequences whose repetition structure and predictability varied over time. For each voxel independently, we used computational modelling to estimate responses for stimulus drive, repetition suppression, and expectations. We then partitioned the unique and shared variance of these components to estimate their relative importance in modulating BOLD activity across cortical layers in auditory cortex. Expectation-related signals explained most unique variance in deep (infagranular) layers, in line with accounts that place internal model representations and belief updates in deeper cortical populations. Variance jointly explained by stimulus drive and expectation was instead strongest in superficial layers, consistent with these compartments expressing computations that combine bottom-up input with top-down predictions, such as prediction error signalling. Finally, repetition suppression accounted for variance uniformly across depth, suggesting an adaptation-like mechanism that modulates responsiveness without a clear laminar bias. Together, the data suggest that deep layers contain content-specific predictive models, superficial layers register prediction-input alignment, and repetition suppression provides a depth-invariant, local gain control that complements predictive processing.",
