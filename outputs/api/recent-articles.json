      "title": "PileUp: A Tufting Approach to Soft, Tactile, and Volumetric E-Textile Interfaces",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.21000v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present PileUp, a tufted pile e-textile sensing approach that offers unique affordances through the tactile expressiveness and richness of its continuous, threaded-volume construction. By integrating conductive yarns in looped or cut pile forms, PileUp transforms soft 3-dimensional textiles into multimodal sensors capable of detecting mechanical deformations such as pressure, bending, and strain, as well as environmental conditions like moisture. We propose a design space that outlines the relationships between texture, form factor, and sensing affordances of tufted textiles. We characterize electrical responses under compression, bending, and strain, reporting sensor behaviors. To demonstrate versatility, we present three application scenarios in which PileUp sensors are seamlessly integrated into soft fabrics: a meditation rug with multi-zone sensing, a fleece sleeve that detects arm motion, and a moisture-sensing wall art. Our results establish tufting as an accessible yet expressive fabrication method for creating integrated sensing textiles, distinguishing our work from traditional flat textile sensors.",

      "title": "Beyond the Legal Lens: A Sociotechnical Taxonomy of Lived Privacy Incidents and Harms",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.20791v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: To understand how privacy incidents lead to harms, HCI researchers have historically leveraged legal frameworks. However, these frameworks expect acute, tangible harms and thus may not cover the full range of human experience relevant to modern-day digital privacy. To address this gap, our research builds upon these existing frameworks to develop a more comprehensive representation of people's lived experiences with privacy harms. We analyzed 369 privacy incidents reported by individuals from the general public. We found a broader range of privacy incidents and harms than accounted for in existing legal frameworks. The majority of reported privacy harms were not based on tangible harm, but on fear and loss of psychological safety. We also characterize the actors, motives, and information associated with various incidents. This work contributes a new framework for understanding digital privacy harms that can be utilized both in research and practice.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20660v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into video lecture production has the potential to transform higher education by streamlining content creation and enhancing accessibility. This paper investigates a semi automated workflow that combines Google Gemini for script generation, Amazon Polly for voice synthesis, and Microsoft PowerPoint for video assembly. Unlike fully automated text to video platforms, this hybrid approach preserves pedagogical intent while ensuring script to slide synchronization, narrative coherence, and customization. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Gemini in generating accurate and context-sensitive scripts for visually rich academic presentations, while Polly provides natural-sounding narration with controllable pacing. A two course pilot study was conducted to evaluate AI generated instructional videos (AIIV) against human instructional videos (HIV). Both qualitative and quantitative results indicate that AIIVs are comparable to HIVs in terms of learning outcomes, with students reporting high levels of clarity, coherence, and usability. However, limitations remain, particularly regarding audio quality and the absence of human-like avatars. The findings suggest that AI assisted video production can reduce instructor workload, improve scalability, and deliver effective learning resources, while future improvements in synthetic voices and avatars may further enhance learner engagement.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20657v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The development of agents with emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly vital due to their significant role in human-computer interaction and the growing integration of computer systems across various sectors of society. Affective computing aims to design intelligent systems that can recognize, evoke, and express human emotions, thereby emulating human emotional intelligence. While previous reviews have focused on specific aspects of this field, there has been limited comprehensive research that encompasses emotion understanding, elicitation, and expression, along with the related challenges. This survey addresses this gap by providing a holistic overview of core components of artificial emotion intelligence. It covers emotion understanding through multimodal data processing, as well as affective cognition, which includes cognitive appraisal, emotion mapping, and adaptive modulation in decision-making, learning, and reasoning. Additionally, it addresses the synthesis of emotional expression across text, speech, and facial modalities to enhance human-agent interaction. This paper identifies and analyzes the key challenges and issues encountered in the development of affective systems, covering state-of-the-art methodologies designed to address them. Finally, we highlight promising future directions, with particular emphasis on the potential of generative technologies to advance affective computing.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20656v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The development of web-based geospatial dashboards for risk analysis and decision support is often challenged by the difficulty in visualization of big, multi-dimensional environmental data, implementation complexity, and limited automation. We introduce a generative AI framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the creation of interactive geospatial dashboards from user-defined inputs including UI wireframes, requirements, and data sources. By incorporating a structured knowledge graph, the workflow embeds domain knowledge into the generation process and enable accurate and context-aware code completions. A key component of our approach is the Context-Aware Visual Prompting (CAVP) mechanism, which extracts encodes and interface semantics from visual layouts to guide LLM driven generation of codes. The new framework also integrates a self-validation mechanism that uses an agent-based LLM and Pass@k evaluation alongside semantic metrics to assure output reliability. Dashboard snippets are paired with data visualization codebases and ontological representations, enabling a pipeline that produces scalable React-based completions using the MVVM architectural pattern. Our results demonstrate improved performance over baseline approaches and expanded functionality over third party platforms, while incorporating multi-page, fully functional interfaces. We successfully developed a framework to implement LLMs, demonstrated the pipeline for automated code generation, deployment, and performed chain-of-thought AI agents in self-validation. This integrative approach is guided by structured knowledge and visual prompts, providing an innovative geospatial solution in enhancing risk analysis and decision making.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20655v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When creating choropleth maps, mapmakers often bin (i.e., group, classify) quantitative data values into groups to help show that certain areas fall within a similar range of values. For instance, a mapmaker may divide counties into groups of high, middle, and low life expectancy (measured in years). It is well known that different binning methods (e.g., natural breaks, quantile) yield different groupings, meaning the same data can be presented differently depending on how it is divided into bins. To help guide a wide variety of users, we present a new, open source, web-based, geospatial visualization tool, Exploropleth, that lets users interact with a catalog of established data binning methods, and subsequently compare, customize, and export custom maps. This tool advances the state of the art by providing multiple binning methods in one view and supporting administrative unit reclassification on-the-fly. We interviewed 16 cartographers and geographic information systems (GIS) experts from 13 government organizations, non-government organizations (NGOs), and federal agencies who identified opportunities to integrate Exploropleth into their existing mapmaking workflow, and found that the tool has potential to educate students as well as mapmakers with varying levels of experience.

We present CodeVaani, a multilingual speech-driven assistant for understanding code, built into Bodhitree [1], a Learning Management System developed at IIT Bombay. It is a voice-enabled assistant that helps learners explore programming concepts in their native languages. The system integrates Indic ASR, a codeaware transcription refinement module, and a code model for generating relevant answers. Responses are provided in both text and audio for natural interaction. In a study with 28 beginner programmers, CodeVaani achieved 75% response accuracy, with over 80% of participants rating the experience positively. Compared to classroom assistance, our framework offers ondemand availability, scalability to support many learners, and multilingual support that lowers the entry barrier for students with limited English proficiency.

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20653v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer high-stakes study-abroad questions about admissions, visas, scholarships, and eligibility. Yet it remains unclear how reliably they advise students, and how often otherwise helpful answers drift into unsupported claims (``hallucinations'').\n  This work provides a clear, domain-grounded overview of how current LLMs behave in this setting. Using realistic questions set drawn from ApplyBoard's advising workflows -- an EdTech platform that supports students from discovery to enrolment -- we evaluate two essentials side by side: accuracy (is the information correct and complete?) and hallucination (does the model add content not supported by the question or domain evidence). These questions are categorized by domain scope which can be a single-domain or multi-domain -- when it must integrate evidence across areas such as admissions, visas, and scholarships.\n  To reflect real advising quality, we grade answers with a simple rubric which is correct, partial, or wrong. The rubric is domain-coverage-aware: an answer can be partial if it addresses only a subset of the required domains, and it can be over-scoped if it introduces extra, unnecessary domains; both patterns are captured in our scoring as under-coverage or reduced relevance/hallucination.\n  We also report measures of faithfulness and answer relevance, alongside an aggregate hallucination score, to capture relevance and usefulness. All models are tested with the same questions for a fair, head-to-head comparison.\n  Our goals are to: (1) give a clear picture of which models are most dependable for study-abroad advising, (2) surface common failure modes -- where answers are incomplete, off-topic, or unsupported, and (3) offer a practical, reusable protocol for auditing LLMs before deployment in education and advising contexts.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20652v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The increasing trust in large language models (LLMs), especially in the form of chatbots, is often undermined by the lack of their extrinsic evaluation. This holds particularly true in nutrition, where randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard, and experts demand them for evidence-based deployment. LLMs have shown promising results in this field, but these are limited to intrinsic setups. We address this gap by running the first RCT involving LLMs for nutrition. We augment a rule-based chatbot with two LLM-based features: (1) message rephrasing for conversational variety and engagement, and (2) nutritional counselling through a fine-tuned model. In our seven-week RCT (n=81), we compare chatbot variants with and without LLM integration. We measure effects on dietary outcome, emotional well-being, and engagement. Despite our LLM-based features performing well in intrinsic evaluation, we find that they did not yield consistent benefits in real-world deployment. These results highlight critical gaps between intrinsic evaluations and real-world impact, emphasising the need for interdisciplinary, human-centred approaches.\\footnote{We provide all of our code and results at: \\\\ \\href{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}{https://github.com/saeshyra/diet-chatbot-trial}}",

      "content": "arXiv:2502.18710v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Understanding convergent learning -- the degree to which independently trained neural systems -- whether multiple artificial networks or brains and models -- arrive at similar internal representations -- is crucial for both neuroscience and AI. Yet, the literature remains narrow in scope -- typically examining just a handful of models with one dataset, relying on one alignment metric, and evaluating networks at a single post-training checkpoint. We present a large-scale audit of convergent learning, spanning dozens of vision models and thousands of layer-pair comparisons, to close these long-standing gaps. First, we pit three alignment families against one another -- linear regression (affine-invariant), orthogonal Procrustes (rotation-/reflection-invariant), and permutation/soft-matching (unit-order-invariant). We find that orthogonal transformations align representations nearly as effectively as more flexible linear ones, and although permutation scores are lower, they significantly exceed chance, indicating a privileged representational basis. Tracking convergence throughout training further shows that nearly all eventual alignment crystallizes within the first epoch -- well before accuracy plateaus -- indicating it is largely driven by shared input statistics and architectural biases, not by the final task solution. Finally, when models are challenged with a battery of out-of-distribution images, early layers remain tightly aligned, whereas deeper layers diverge in proportion to the distribution shift. These findings fill critical gaps in our understanding of representational convergence, with implications for neuroscience and AI.",

Treatment of medically refractory epilepsy is essential for patients to achieve remission, improve psychological functioning, and enhance social and vocational outcomes. Here, we show a state-of-the-art method that stabilizes fractional dynamical networks modeled from intracranial EEG data, effectively suppressing seizure activity in 34 out of 35 total spontaneous episodes from patients at the University of Pennsylvania and the Mayo Clinic. We perform a multi-scale analysis and show that the fractal behavior and stability properties of these data distinguish between four epileptic states: interictal, pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal. Furthermore, the simulated controlled signals exhibit substantial amplitude reduction ($49\\%$ average).

      "content": "arXiv:2511.21677v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) is driven by both focal inflammation and compartmentalized neurodegeneration, yet the relative effect of lesion-independent thalamic atrophy on information processing speed (IPS) remains unclear. This retrospective cohort study included 100 participants with MS. Automatic segmentation techniques quantified lesion load and delineated 26 thalamic regions of interest (ROIs). Linear models compared associations between ROI volumes and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) performance in lesion-adjusted and unadjusted models. Twenty-one of 26 ROIs showed significant SDMT associations before lesion adjustment; twelve remained significant after adjustment. Lesion-independent associations were observed in the global thalamus, sensory relay nuclei (ventral posterolateral, medial and lateral geniculate), and associative hubs (pulvinar and mediodorsal-parafascicular complex). These intrinsically vulnerable nuclei exhibited significantly lower lesion-mediated effects (13.4%) than those losing significance after adjustment (34.2%, p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that IPS impairment reflects heterogenous contributions from both primary and secondary degeneration, with nucleus-specific phenotyping potentially informing identification of higher risk individuals.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.21605v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: How does the brain know what is out there and what is not? Living organisms cannot rely solely on sensory signals for perception because they are noisy and ambiguous. To transform sensory signals into stable percepts, the brain uses its prior knowledge or beliefs. Current theories describe perceptual beliefs as probability distributions over the features of the stimuli, summarised by their mean and variance. Beliefs are updated by feature prediction errors: the mismatch between expected and observed feature values. This framework explains how the brain encodes unexpected changes in stimulus features (e.g., higher or lower pitch, stronger or weaker motion). How the brain updates beliefs about a stimulus' presence or absence is, however, unclear.\n  We propose that the detection of absence relies on a distinct form of prediction error dedicated to reducing the beliefs on stimulus occurrence. We call this signal absence prediction error. Using the human auditory system as a model for sensory processing, we developed a paradigm designed to test this hypothesis. fMRI results showed that absence prediction error is encoded in the auditory thalamus and cortex, indicating that absence is explicitly represented in subcortical sensory pathways. Moreover, while feature prediction error is already encoded in the auditory midbrain, absence prediction error was not, implying that absence-related error signals are supported by a different circuit.\n  These results identify a neural mechanism for the detection of sensory absence. Such mechanisms may be disrupted in conditions such as psychosis, where predictions about absence and presence are impaired.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20990v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Criticality describes a regime between order and chaos that supports flexible yet stable information processing. Here we examine whether neural dynamics can be volitionally shifted toward criticality through the self-regulation of attention. We examined ten experienced practitioners of meditation during a 10-day retreat, comparing refined states of meditative absorption, called the jhanas, to regular mindfulness of breathing. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) and physiological data during these practices and quantified the signal's dynamical properties using Lempel-Ziv complexity, signal entropy, chaoticity and long-range temporal correlations. In addition, we estimated perturbational sensitivity using a global auditory oddball mismatch negativity (MMN) during meditation. Relative to mindfulness, jhana was associated with pronounced self-reported sensory fading, slower respiration, higher neural signal diversity across multiple measures, reduced chaoticity, and enhanced MMN amplitude over frontocentral sites. Spectral analyses showed a flatter aperiodic one over f component and a frequency-specific reorganization of long-range temporal correlations. Together, increased diversity with reduced chaoticity and heightened deviance detection indicate a shift toward a metastable, near-critical regime during jhana. We propose an overlap of the phenomenology of jhana with minimal phenomenal experiences in terms of progressive attenuation of sensory content with preserved tonic alertness. Accordingly, our findings suggest that criticality is a candidate neurophysiological marker of the absorptive, minimal-content dimension of the minimal phenomenal experience.",

Despite the rapid rise and promise of implantable technologies, there is a need for better and more capable wearable and non-invasive approaches whilst also minimising hardware requirements. We present a non-invasive BCI for mind-drawing that iteratively infers a subject's internal visual intent by adaptively presenting visual stimuli (probes) on a screen encoded at different flicker-frequencies and analyses the steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). A Gabor-inspired or machine-learned policies dynamically update the spatial placement of the visual probes on the screen to explore the image space and reconstruct simple imagined shapes within approximately two minutes or less using just single-channel EEG data. Additionally, by leveraging stable diffusion models, reconstructed mental images can be transformed into realistic and detailed visual representations. Whilst we expect that similar results might be achievable with e.g. eye-tracking techniques, our work shows that symbiotic human-AI interaction can significantly increase BCI bit-rates by more than a factor 5x, providing a platform for future development of AI-augmented BCI.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20692v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose a framework for constructing combinatorial complexes (CCs) from fMRI time series data that captures both pairwise and higher-order neural interactions through information-theoretic measures, bridging topological deep learning and network neuroscience. Current graph-based representations of brain networks systematically miss the higher-order dependencies that characterize neural complexity, where information processing often involves synergistic interactions that cannot be decomposed into pairwise relationships. Unlike topological lifting approaches that map relational structures into higher-order domains, our method directly constructs CCs from statistical dependencies in the data. Our CCs generalize graphs by incorporating higher-order cells that represent collective dependencies among brain regions, naturally accommodating the multi-scale, hierarchical nature of neural processing. The framework constructs data-driven combinatorial complexes using O-information and S-information measures computed from fMRI signals, preserving both pairwise connections and higher-order cells (e.g., triplets, quadruplets) based on synergistic dependencies. Using NetSim simulations as a controlled proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate our CC construction pipeline and show how both pairwise and higher-order dependencies in neural time series can be quantified and represented within a unified structure. This work provides a framework for brain network representation that preserves fundamental higher-order structure invisible to traditional graph methods, and enables the application of topological deep learning (TDL) architectures to neural data.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.20689v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.",

The aim of this paper is to employ phase plane analysis to systematically investigate diverse firing patterns generated by the AdEx model under varying parametric conditions. We first introduce the fundamental equations and parameter configurations of the AdEx model to numerically simulate the six representative firing patterns in the AdEx model. And then we use phase plane analysis to explore the dynamic mechanism of these firing patterns under different input currents and parametric conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the AdEx model can simulate multiple firing patterns, including Tonic Spiking, Adapting, Initial Bursting, Busting, Transient Spiking and Delayed Spiking firing patterns. These results not only advance the understanding of complex electrophysiological phenomena in neurons but also provide theoretical foundations for applications in many fields like neuromorphic computing and brain-computer interfaces.",
