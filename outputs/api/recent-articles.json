      "title": "Ethical, legal, and sociocultural considerations in neural device explantation: a systematic review",
      "content": "IntroductionImplantable neural devices, including brain\u2013computer interfaces and spinal cord stimulators, hold significant therapeutic promise for conditions such as paralysis and chronic pain. However, the novelty of these technologies introduces unique ethical challenges. While much of the existing literature emphasizes development-related concerns such as device safety, the ethical issues surrounding explantation remain relatively underexplored.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review to identify ethical, legal, and sociocultural considerations relevant to the explantation of neural devices. The review applied the IEEE BRAIN Neuroethics framework as a guiding structure for the categorization of the themes. A subsequent thematic analysis was performed to categorize and synthesize findings across studies.ResultsThematic analysis revealed that medical motives were the predominant factor in discussions of explantation, with 83% of studies citing medical complications as a central concern. Additional themes identified included changes in cognition and behavior, emotional well-being, lack of therapeutic benefit, identity, financial issues, autonomy, post-trial considerations, and neurorights.DiscussionOur findings underscore the multifaceted nature of neural device explantation, extending beyond purely medical considerations to include psychological, financial, legal, and sociocultural dimensions. These results highlight the necessity of interdisciplinary approaches to adequately address the broad spectrum of challenges associated with explantation.",

      "title": "A clinical case report on transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound neuromodulation for central post-stroke pain",
      "content": "Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) manifests as persistent or intermittent pain following cerebral infarction or hemorrhage and is described as \u201cone of the most agonizing, disabling, and refractory pain syndromes.\u201d Its treatment represents a significant clinical challenge. In this case, we used transcranial low-intensity focused ultrasound (tLIFU), an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation approach distinct from pharmacological and traditional neuromodulation methods, to treat CPSP patients, achieving satisfactory outcomes. This approach may inspire new perspectives on innovative pain management. A 66-year-old male veteran suffered long-term CPSP, with unsatisfactory pain relief from previous paregoric interventions, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) revealed abnormal activity in a region of interest (ROI) that responded to analgesic medication adjustments. This ROI was anatomically consistent with the cingulum bundle. Given this finding, we used tLIFU to demonstrate deep stimulation of the ROI. Remarkable pain reduction was observed after 1\u202fweek of tLIFU neuromodulation, allowing for a slight tapering of the gabapentin dose. The analgesic effects of tLIFU were sustained throughout a 5-month follow-up period, with no adverse events reported. Since day 120, the patient has remained off analgesic medications, and at the 150-day follow-up, BOLD-fMRI revealed a normalized activity pattern in the region of interest (ROI). Additionally, significant clinical improvement was noted in the patient\u2019s emotional state. This case report highlights the potential of tLIFU technology to expand therapeutic options in clinical pain management. Exploratory research into the clinical efficacy and the underlying mechanisms of tLIFU in pain treatment may contribute to a deeper understanding of pain pathogenesis and support the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

      "content": "Vision loss due to illness can result from various medical conditions that affect the eyes. Advanced devices like OCT and ultra-widefield retinal cameras are expensive, making them less accessible in resource-limited settings. While eye image capture devices have transformed disease detection, they require expert analysis, and also variability between observers can lead to inconsistent diagnoses. Many devices do not seamlessly integrate with electronic health records (EHR), complicating workflow...",

This retrospective study included 103 patients who underwent cataract surgery between December 2023 and June 2024. Preoperative and postoperative visual acuity were recorded, and patients were categorized into low vision or normal vision groups based on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 1 month post-surgery.

Previously considered a strict dietary specialist on tree exudates and insects, recent observations have revealed hitherto unappreciated plasticity in its feeding behaviour, encompassing fruits and even small vertebrates. While arthropods are an important seasonal component of the diet of this species, we still have little idea of the types of insect prey taken in nature, or the...",
