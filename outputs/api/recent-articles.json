      "title": "Toward in-silico data assessment for passive BCIs: generating EEG rhythms with GANs",
      "content": "Objective. Passive brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) has gained traction as reliable method for monitoring human vigilance in attention-demanding critical contexts. Unfortunately, the lack of extensive public datasets compromises artificial intelligence (AI) research. Proposing a solution to this issue, we augmented two EEG datasets using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Furthermore, we defined a quality-assessment pipeline to overcome the absence of a univocal method to test synthetic data. Approach. Using GAN, we augmented a publicly resting-state EEG dataset sustained attention to response task and a custom one simulating activity during repetitive tasks. After extracting relevant time-variant rhythms via the continuous wavelet transform, we quantitatively compared synthetic data with the real one using L2 distance and cross-correlation function. To evaluate the impact of data augmentation, we trained six forecasting models, three on the original and three on the augmented datasets, over the whole, half and a quarter of total available data, and compared improvements in MAE and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). To study the forecaster\u2019s embeddings, we computed a metric inspired by the Fr\u00e9chet inception distance (FID) between latent values of real and synthetic data. Finally, to offer a baseline comparison, we extended the performance and embeddings analysis to data generated by a simple linear interpolation method. Main results. The integration of GAN-produced synthetic data improved signal prediction, as evidenced by a 29.0%, 46.4%, 37.4% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for splits of the resting-state dataset, and an average MAE reduction of 15.4%, 21.2% for 100% and 50% splits, and a \u223c2.5% increase for the 25% split. Conversely, training on interpolated data manifests worse performance and denotes extremely small FID distances w.r.t real signals, a sign of overspecialization. Significance. This study contributes a reproducible and complete framework for EEG signal generation and evaluation, addressing one of the main barriers to scalable AI application in BCI.",

      "title": "Dissociating the neural codes for multiple pitch perception in humans",
      "content": "Pitch is crucial for speech and music perception, yet its neural code remains contested. The classic \"rate-place\" theory suggests that pitch is computed from spatial patterns of average neural firing rates along the cochlear tonotopic axis. These cues are thought to be robust for isolated harmonic complex tones (HCTs) but degraded for spectrally dense mixtures of simultaneous HCTs (e.g., musical chords) due to auditory filtering. In many cases, pitch perception remains feasible for HCT mixtures, but it is unclear whether listeners utilize residual rate-place cues or alternative neural codes. To adjudicate between these possibilities, we generated rate-place metamers (META), which are synthetic stimuli with simulated auditory-nerve average-rate responses that are nearly identical to those of original pitch-evoking stimuli (ORIG). Using these stimuli, listeners completed four psychophysical experiments that spanned a wide range of acoustic and cognitive complexity, from single-HCT pitch discrimination to harmonic-expectation judgments. Combining the behavioral data with predictive models of listener performance, we found that listener performance on single pitch discrimination tasks could be adequately explained by a rate-place model, with or without simultaneous pitch maskers (Experiments 1 and 2). More complex tasks involving attention to all pitches in a three-pitch mixture (Experiments 3 and 4) showed a pattern of results more difficult to account for with a rate-place model, perhaps suggesting a role for integration of temporal cues.",

      "title": "Tuberous sclerosis complex, epilepsy, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis: a pilot study of shared and divergent microbial signatures",
      "content": "ObjectiveTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) presents with a broad clinical spectrum. While some individuals exhibit mild symptoms, most experience seizures and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Emerging evidence suggests that both genetic and environmental factors, including gut microbiota, may influence epilepsy susceptibility. The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA) is a key communication pathway through which intestinal microbes impact the central nervous system. Although the role of the MGBA in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, particularly seizures, has been explored in both animal models and humans, data specific to TSC are lacking.MethodsIn this exploratory study, we assessed whether individuals with TSC (n\u202f=\u202f15) display a distinct gut microbial signature using V3\u2013V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Their profiles were compared with two control groups: 18 children with epilepsy (EPI) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Stool short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels and dietary intake were also evaluated.ResultsNo significant differences were observed among the three groups in dietary intake, SCFA and branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) levels, or alpha-diversity. Beta-diversity analysis showed a non-significant trend toward clustering of TSC and EPI samples, indicating a shared microbial profile distinct from HC. Taxonomic analysis revealed a reduction in Firmicutes\u2014particularly the Ruminococcaceae family and the genus Gemmiger\u2014in both TSC and EPI groups, consistent with epilepsy-associated dysbiosis. Notably, the TSC group showed a specific enrichment in Akkermansiaceae, a feature also reported in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as CDKL5 deficiency disorder and cerebral palsy.SignificanceThese preliminary findings suggest that gut microbiota alterations may contribute to neuroinflammatory processes linked to epileptogenesis and comorbidities in TSC. Further studies are needed to validate these results and explore microbiota-based therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals with TSC and their caregivers.",

      "title": "Finite element model predicts micromotion-induced strain profiles that correlate with the functional performance of Utah arrays in humans and non-human primates",
      "content": "Objective. Utah arrays are widely used in both humans and non-human primates (NHPs) for intracortical brain\u2013computer interfaces, primarily for detecting electrical signals from cortical tissue to decode motor commands. Recently, these arrays have also been applied to deliver electrical stimulation aimed at restoring sensory functions. A key challenge limiting their longevity is the micromotion between the array and cortical tissue, which may induce mechanical strain in surrounding tissue and contribute to performance decline. This strain, due to mechanical mismatch, can exacerbate glial scarring around the implant, reducing the efficacy of Utah arrays in recording neuronal activity and delivering electrical stimulation. Approach. To investigate this, we employed a finite element model to predict tissue strains resulting from micromotion. Main results. Our findings indicated that strain profiles around edge and corner electrodes were greater than those around interior shanks, affecting both maximum and average strains within 50 \u00b5m of the electrode tip. We then correlated these predicted tissue strains with in-vivo electrode performance metrics. We found negative correlations between 1 kHz impedance and tissue strains in human motor arrays and NHP area V4 arrays at 1 month, 1 year, and 2 years post-implantation. In human motor arrays, the peak-to-peak waveform voltage and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of spontaneous activity were also negatively correlated with strain. Conversely, we observed a positive correlation between the evoked SNR of multi-unit activity and strain in NHP area V4 arrays. Significance. This study establishes a spatial dependence of electrode performance in Utah arrays that correlates with tissue strain.",

      "title": "Iris 128x: open-source 128 channel headstages for neural stimulation and recording",
      "content": "Objective. Investigation into complex neural circuits necessitates interfaces capable of high channel count recording and stimulation. However, existing commercial neural headstages often have limited scalability, restrictive proprietary designs, and constrained bidirectional capabilities, which worsens accessibility challenges and compels researchers to reinvent tools rather than build on a shared foundation. Approach. Here, we present two open-source, 128 channel headstages\u2014Iris 128B and Iris 128S\u2014designed for integration with microelectrode arrays. The Iris 128B enables fully bidirectional interfacing, with stimulation or recording across all 128 electrode channels, while the Iris 128S provides recording on 128 channels and stimulation on 16 simultaneous channels, which can be assigned to any 16 of the 32 available stimulation channels. Both designs use Intan Technologies\u2019 RHS and RHD series integrated circuits for amplification, filtering, digitization and stimulation, and are available on GitHub. Main results. The headstages were validated through benchtop impedance, noise, and frequency response measurements, as well as acute in vivo recordings in an anesthetized rat. Results demonstrate low noise levels and reliable signal acquisition across all channels. Significance. By releasing fully documented printed circuit board designs for headstages, this work aims to take a step towards broader adoption of bidirectional recording and stimulation systems while increasing channel counts. Future iterations will focus on miniaturization and wireless integration to improve usability in chronic and freely moving small animal experiments.",
