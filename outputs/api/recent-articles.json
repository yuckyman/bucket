      "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
      "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "title": "Case Report: When multiple system atrophy masquerades as CASPR2 autoimmune encephalopathy: a diagnostic pitfall",
      "content": "IntroductionMultiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic, adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by rapid progression. Early diagnosis remains particularly challenging, especially when CASPR2 antibodies are detected during the early stages of disease progression.Case presentationA 56-year-old female presented with chronic progressive cerebellar ataxia. Serum analysis revealed the presence of CASPR2 antibodies. Brain MRI demonstrated atrophy of the brainstem and cerebellum. The external anal-sphincter electromyography (EAS-EMG) indicated autonomic nerve dysfunction in the absence of overt clinical symptoms. Despite treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, no clinical improvement was observed. During follow-up, symptoms of autonomic nerve dysfunction emerged, leading to a clinical established diagnosis of cerebellar subtype of multiple system atrophy (MSA-C).ConclusionIn the early stages of MSA, autonomic nerve dysfunction may not manifest clinically. Therefore, close follow-up is essential for accurate diagnosis. EAS-EMG exhibits high sensitivity in detecting subclinical autonomic dysfunction. Although the co-occurrence of MSA-C and high-titer (1:100) CASPR2-IgG is uncommon, this case highlights the critical importance of relying on the overall clinical presentation, rather than on isolated laboratory findings, to establish the primary diagnosis.",

      "title": "tDCS peripheral nerve stimulation can enhance passive avoidance learning in rats",
      "content": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is being considered as a treatment for many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Rodent models of tDCS have been used in several behavioral tasks to demonstrate the technique\u2019s benefits in improving memory and learning. Recent research suggests that peripheral nerve stimulation in tDCS may be responsible for some of its effects. In this work, we first aimed to repeat a previously reported tDCS effect of improved passive avoidance task (PAT) learning in a minimally restrictive rat model and investigate whether peripheral nerve stimulation contributed to these effects by using two additional stimulation groups in which the electric field in the brain (transcranial-only tDCS) and skin (transcutaneous-only tDCS) were separated. Analysis revealed that, at 0.25\u202fmA, none of the stimulation conditions significantly improved PAT learning compared to sham. This non-replication experiment calls for more research to investigate whether tDCS at 0.25\u202fmA can truly improve PAT learning in rats. In a subsequent experiment, we aimed to investigate the effects of transcutaneous-only tDCS at 2\u202fmA, an amplitude more relevant to tDCS in humans. We found that 30\u202fmin of DC stimulation at 2\u202fmA, with the cathodal electrode implanted over the third occipital nerve, improved PAT learning. This indicates that DC stimulation of peripheral nerves is capable of modulating learning and memory and supports the theory that peripheral nerve stimulation may contribute to some observed effects of tDCS. More research is necessary to investigate the behavioral and neurophysiological effects of DC peripheral nerve stimulation, and its contribution in tDCS effects observed in animals and humans.",

      "title": "Multisensory vs. unisensory learning: how they shape effective connectivity networks subserving unimodal and multimodal integration",
      "content": "The brain synthesizes meaningful interpretations out of the surrounding environment, by integrating sensory input collected by multiple senses. Learning based on contextual multisensory stimulation is considered superior to unisensory. Multisensory methods implemented in rehabilitation and educational studies have demonstrated remarkable neuroplastic changes within cortical networks. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the ensuing neuroplasticity continue to elude comprehension. The present work intends to address this gap at the large-scale level by modeling the experience-induced alterations of multisensory and unisensory training in the effective cortical networks that subserve visual, auditory, and audiovisual information processing. Pre- and post-training EEG analysis demonstrated that the cross-modal training alters significantly the effective connectivity networks in all three modalities, whilst the unisensory methodological approach exerts impact solely on a unisensory (auditory) system. The regions that exhibit most of the alterations are identified within the left medial frontal gyrus (MFG), the left inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), as well as the left insula, areas with renowned multisensory properties. The reconfiguration of the connections following the multisensory training and during the visual and auditory integrative processes concerns mainly higher-order cortical areas, suggesting a top-down process affecting unisensory perception. The results of our study not only strengthen the theory of the superiority of multisensory training compared to unisensory but also indicate that the influence of multimodal training on the unisensory systems succeeds through feedback connections from higher-order association areas, highlighting the complexity of neurophysiological pathways of human perception.",

      "title": "Enhancing the sensitivity of gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate biosensors by electrochemically roughening platinum microelectrodes",
      "content": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (GLU) are two key neurotransmitters (NTs) in processing, plasticity, memory, and network functions. High-sensitivity GABA and GLU biosensors are crucial for investigating the dysregulation of the GABA-GLU balance and improving animal models and human therapies for multiple neurological disorders. We have developed a novel biosensor that utilizes electrochemically roughened (ECR) platinum (Pt) microelectrodes to achieve the highest sensitivity in detecting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which serves as the detection signal for the biosensors. We evaluated three microelectrode surface activation techniques\u2014alcohol cleaning, electrochemical cleaning, and ECR\u2014and the main effects of the ECR pulses at varying frequencies (150\u20136,000\u202fHz) on biosensor sensitivity. ECR-treated microelectrodes reveal a non-linear relationship between the pulse frequency and the H2O2 adsorption, providing the highest sensitivity. Each frequency altered the microelectrode\u2019s roughness differently, resulting in unique surface morphologies and pore geometries, as well as the formation of surface impurities within the pores. The primary factors influencing Pt\u2019s electrocatalytic activity are the pore geometry and the facile Pt kinetics, and not the electroactive area or the impurities in the pores. Particularly, pore geometries at low (250\u202fHz) and high frequencies (2,500\u202fHz) contribute to the highest H2O2 adsorption and sensitivity (6,810\u202f\u00b1\u202f124\u202fnA\u202f\u03bcM\u22121\u202fcm\u22122), the highest value reported in the literature. The EIS model reveals that ECR-treated microelectrodes exhibit heterogeneous pores and partially smooth, flat regions between the pores, with the catalytic activity primarily occurring in the pore walls rather than the flat regions. The EIS data indicate superior electrical conductivity in the pore walls, which enhances the GABA and GLU peak sensitivities to 45\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.4\u202fnA\u202f\u03bcM\u22121\u202fcm\u22122 and 1,510\u202f\u00b1\u202f47.0\u202fnA\u202f\u03bcM\u22121\u202fcm\u22122, respectively. The corresponding limits of detection are 1.60\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13\u202fnM and 12.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.73\u202fnM (n\u202f=\u202f3). These findings underscore the significance of ECR in enhancing the performance of Pt MEA-based enzymatic biosensors, thereby paving the way for advanced, ultrasensitive biosensors for neurochemical monitoring in challenging in vivo applications.",

      "title": "The course of mechanical allodynia differs between forelimb innervation territories following median nerve injury in the rat",
      "content": "Functional deficits and chronic neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injuries pose major clinical challenges. For preclinical evaluation of novel treatments, reliable methods for assessing functional recovery and robust animal models with high translational potential are crucial. Following peripheral nerve injury reinnervation of denervated target organs is not only achieved by regeneration of the original nerve, but also by collateral sprouting of adjacent intact nerves. In this study motor and sensory recovery was analyzed in a rat model of median nerve injury and repair using distinct functional test. Ten male Wistar rats underwent bilateral median nerve transection. In one forelimb the nerve was repaired using epineurial sutures, while in the contralateral forelimb the nerve remained unrepaired and served as internal control. For 12 weeks post-surgery, the Von Frey Test, the Grasping Test and CatWalk gait analysis were performed weekly. Sensory reinnervation and mechanical allodynia were evaluated with the Von Frey Test in distinct predefined test areas considering the innervation of the forepaws, allowing for indirect assessment of collateral nerve sprouting. Early mechanical allodynia developed within two weeks after median nerve injury in all innervation areas of the forepaw. This was associated with significant alterations of Print Width, Print Area, Duty Cycle, Swing Speed, Swing Time and Stand Index. From week 6 onward late mechanical allodynia paralleled with gait improvements and return of measurable grasping strength on the reconstructed side. The methodology utilized in our study, is feasible to comprehensively assess motor and sensory nerve regeneration paving the way for valid evaluation of future therapeutic strategies in a rat median nerve injury model.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
