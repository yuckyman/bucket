      "content": "<p class=\"\">Carrasco, C. D., Bahle, B., Simmons, A. M., &amp; Luck, S. J. (2024). Using multivariate pattern analysis to increase effect sizes for event-related potential analyses. Psychophysiology, 61, e14570. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14570</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.07.566051\">preprint</a>]</p><p class=\"\">Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) can be used to \u201cdecode\u201d subtle information from ERP signals, such as which of several faces a participant is perceiving or the orientation that someone is holding in working memory (see <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">this previous blog post</a>). This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

      "content": "Conduct disorder (CD) is the leading global cause of mental health burden in children and adolescents and has recently been hypothesized to be a neurodevelopmental disorder. Although prior research has identified neuroanatomical differences associated with CD, it remains unclear whether these differences reflect atypical brain development. Here, we investigated the difference between an individual's brain age and chronological age as a proxy for variations in brain maturation. Using a pretrained model, we estimated brain age from structural neuroimaging data obtained from 1,119 youth with CD and 1,183 typically developing controls across 14 international cohorts participating in the ENIGMA-Antisocial Behavior Working Group. Youth with CD exhibited a statistically robust but small acceleration in brain age compared to typically developing youth (around 0.50 years), which was restricted to the adolescence-onset subtype of the disorder. Our large-scale, coordinated analysis provides the first evidence of accelerated neurodevelopment as a potential mechanism underlying CD.",

      "title": "Organization, Neuronal Composition, and Dynamics of Neuronal Ensembles in the Songbird Auditory Forebrain",
      "content": "Auditory learning is a key component of vocal learning and communication. Neurons involved in auditory learning are typically examined as single encoders, but there is increasing evidence that the coincident activity of groups of neurons, or ensembles, is important for the processing and transmission of sensory information. In songbirds, a forebrain region analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortex, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), is crucial for representing and learning auditory signals. In the awake state, NCM neurons exhibit stimulus-specific adaptation in response to repeated presentation of song stimuli, considered a form of auditory working memory. Yet, how complex stimuli like song are encoded by networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is essentially unknown. Using in-vivo single-unit electrophysiology, we systematically unveiled neuronal ensembles that operate at high temporal precision (< 10 ms) across the NCM of awake zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Our data show that multiple ensembles are concurrently activated by song with high temporal precision, and that their neuronal composition is heterogeneous, topographically proximate, and biased towards excitatory members. NCM ensembles adapt to song playback and, notably, become more stimulus selective over tens of minutes, accompanied by fast remodeling (membership gain and/or loss) during adaptation. Altogether, our results suggest that song representations in the forebrain can be conveyed by multiple, dynamic network ensembles in parallel. These findings advance our knowledge of the composition, dynamics, and neuronal network reorganization of ensembles as complex sensory stimuli become increasingly familiar.",

      "title": "Chemogenetic activation induces persistent transcriptomic remodeling and functional plasticity in cultured astrocytes",
      "content": "Astrocytes are essential regulators of neuronal function and brain homeostasis. Recent methodological advances have increasingly revealed their active roles through precise manipulation of astrocyte function in the brain. While chemogenetic strategies, such as Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), have been widely used to recapitulate endogenous G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signaling and selectively modulate astrocyte activity, the molecular mechanisms accompanying DREADD activation remain incompletely understood. Here, we characterized the transcriptional responses of cultured cortical astrocytes and found that DREADD activation induces profound changes in astrocytic gene expression profiles. Activation of Gi-, Gq-, and Gs-coupled DREADDs elicited distinct transcriptomic responses. Transcription factor activity profiling further revealed that each DREADD subtype selectively modulates a distinct set of transcription factors that collectively shape astrocytic transcriptomic responses, thereby indicating subtype-specific transcriptional mechanisms. Importantly, DREADD activation induced persistent changes in the astrocytic transcriptome that remained detectable even three days after stimulation. These transcriptomic alterations were associated with sustained changes in astrocytic calcium responses to extracellular ATP, indicating plastic changes in astrocytic physiological function. Together, these findings provide a molecular framework for interpreting astrocytic DREADD manipulations and reveal a mechanistic basis for functional plasticity and heterogeneity of astrocytes.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

      "title": "Abnormal functional activity in the cerebellar crus can distinguish patients with migraine with comorbid insomnia",
      "content": "BackgroundMigraine is a prevalent neurological disorder that is frequently observed in clinical practice and is commonly comorbid with insomnia. Insomnia can exacerbate and precipitate migraine attacks, with both conditions exerting a reciprocal influence on one another. The cerebellar crus is significantly associated with the pathophysiology of migraine and insomnia. The relationship between cerebellar crus functional alterations and migraine-associated insomnia remains unclear. This study utilizes resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine functional alterations in the cerebellar crus of patients with migraine and concurrent insomnia.MethodsParticipants underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subsequently, the disparity in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) values among groups was analyzed, followed by functional connectivity (FC) investigations employing the cerebellum crus as seed regions.ResultsMigraine patients frequently experience neuropsychological disorders and insomnia, which are interconnected. Both migraine with insomnia (MwI) and migraine without insomnia (MwoI) groups demonstrated elevated amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in the left Crus I and II compared to the healthy controls (HC) group, with the MwI group exhibiting more pronounced alterations. Additionally, both patient groups showed decreased FC between the left Crus I and the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) relative to the HC group. The MwoI group showed significantly lower FC compared to both the HC and MwI groups. A significant negative correlation was observed between ALFF in the left Crus I/II and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores in the MwoI group. Conversely, in the combined migraine cohort, FC between the left Crus I and the right MTG/ITG showed a positive correlation with PSQI scores.ConclusionThis study identified a correlation between aberrant functional activity in the left Crus I/II and migraine comorbidity with insomnia. These findings provide fresh perspectives on the neural mechanisms underlying the migraine-insomnia relationship, thereby facilitating the identification of potential neuroimaging biomarkers and the exploration of targeted interventions for this patient subgroup.",

      "content": "Objective. This review paper focuses on how both direct current (DC) stimulation and alternating current (AC) stimulation affects the central nervous system\u2019s (CNSs) cells and its potential as a neurotherapeutic. Furthermore, addressing the promise of combinatorial approaches that utilize other treatments alongside electrical stimulation (ES) and how ES has shaped clinical approaches as a new rehabilitation treatment. Approach. Authors conducted this review to bridge the gap between basic research and clinical translation; 124 manuscripts were identified through Google Scholar for insights into ES effects on neurons and glia in both in vitro and in vivo models. Main results. The review summarizes findings from DC and AC stimulation paradigms applied to in vitro or in vivo preclinical models and summarizes the promise of ES when applied clinically. Generally, DC stimulation promotes axonal extension towards the cathode, while axons retract at the anode, limiting regeneration. AC stimulation alternates electrode polarity, enabling axonal extension in both directions. The intensity and duration of ES significantly affects the extent of neurite outgrowth. For astrocytes and microglia, ES\u2014whether AC or DC\u2014downregulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and upregulates anti-inflammatory cytokine production, promoting A2 or M2 reactive states conducive to regeneration, respectively. Regarding oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), both DC and AC stimulation enhance OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes, increasing myelin content and supporting axonal myelination. ES, when combined with stem cell treatments, drug delivery approaches, or with electroactive biomaterials, facilitate greater efficacy of these approaches. Clinically, short-single sessions of ES have shown long-term improvement. More specifically, preliminary efforts have been implemented to restore gait, hand tremors, and speech in spinal cord injuries, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and stroke patients, respectively. Significance. ES is an evolving neurotherapeutic strategy for CNS related disease or injuries. Understanding how ES modulates neurons and glia is critical for optimizing its application in the clinic.",

That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot.

In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating.

As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "content": "Pupil diameter provides a powerful, non-invasive biomarker of brain state, correlating with arousal, attention, cognitive processing, and level of consciousness. Despite its widespread use, pupillometry remains limited by software tools that lack scalability, robustness, and flexibility across experimental conditions. Here we introduce Pupil-DLC, an open-source, DeepLabCut-based pipeline for scalable, markerless tracking of pupil dynamics. Pupil-DLC is trained on 19,500 manually annotated frames selected from over 130 pupil videos of head-fixed mice spanning wakefulness to diverse drug-induced states of consciousness, including psychedelics, and anesthesia. The pipeline robustly captures state-dependent pupil dynamics, achieving high agreement with human-annotated ground truth data and outperforming an established automated method in both accuracy and detection reliability, while maintaining computational efficiency. Pupil-DLC incorporates a dual-model framework comprising a General Model (GM) for high-throughput analysis of infra-red recorded mice pupils and an Individual Model (IM) tailored for session-specific optimization, as well as interpretable confidence metrics that enable principled trade-offs between accuracy and data retention. Notably, the model generalizes, without retraining, to human infrared pupil recordings, supporting cross-species pupillometry. Pupil-DLC provides a flexible, reproducible platform for quantifying pupil-linked brain state dynamics across diverse experimental paradigms and species.",

      "title": "Modelling ferroptosis in a human microglial line by sequential exposure to iron and GPX4 inhibition",
      "content": "Excessive iron accumulation is a pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) and a growing body of evidence suggests that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death (RCD) driven by lipid peroxidation, is implicated in their pathogenesis. Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, buffer iron overload but become susceptible to ferroptotic death, exacerbating neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. To uncover the molecular events leading to microglial ferroptosis, we established a human microglial ferroptosis model using the HMC3 cell line. This model recapitulates core features of ferroptosis, including increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxidation of lipids at the membrane, both rescued by Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1). We used this model to perform integrated multi-omics profiling and identified significant dysregulation in lipid species, notably an accumulation of sterols, including oxysterols such as the 7-oxo-cholesterol, alongside the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) characteristic of ferroptosis. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses corroborated these findings, revealing the upregulation of genes and proteins involved in the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol metabolism. Importantly, the increased expression of some of these key metabolic genes was also reversed by Fer-1 treatment, indicating their role in a pre-ferroptotic signature. Our model provides a novel platform for investigating early molecular events in microglia ferroptosis. Integrating these findings into future investigations could uncover new protective mechanisms against microglia ferroptosis at the crossroad between ROS level mitigation and sterol metabolism.",

      "title": "Case Report: Effective management of a Meige syndrome patient with subthalamic stimulation-induced dyskinesia through timed stimulation programming of different contacts",
      "content": "IntroductionMeige syndrome is a rare adult-onset segmental dystonia characterized by blepharospasms and oromandibular dystonia. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established treatment, but it can lead to stimulation-induced dyskinesia (SID) in some patients. Refractory SID in Meige syndrome after STN-DBS is clinically challenging. We report a case of a Meige syndrome patient who developed refractory SID following STN-DBS and was successfully managed using a novel timed-stimulation programming strategy employing different contacts.Case descriptionA 47-year-old female with a two-year history of Meige syndrome developed refractory SID after the treatment of STN-DBS. Various programming strategies were attempted, including monopolar stimulation, interleaved stimulation, bipolar stimulation et al., but none achieved a balance between symptom control and SID. A novel approach involving timed alternation between ventral contacts (contacts 3 and 7) and dorsal contacts (contacts 4 and 8) was implemented. The stimulation was gradually programmed, the duration of ventral stimulation was increased while decreasing dorsal stimulation. Eventually, the patient achieved significant symptom improvement without SID. The reconstruction of the volume of tissue activated (VTA) revealed that this stimulation strategy likely modulates the neural circuits of pallidothalamic fibers (PTF) to suppress SID.ConclusionThis case demonstrates that this noval timed stimulation programming can effectively manage refractory SID in Meige syndrome patients, offering a viable alternative when conventional methods fail. The findings suggest that PTF stimulation plays a key role in SID suppression, and this strategy warrants further investigation in larger cohorts.",

      "title": "ASXL3 gene variants causing Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome: clinical and genetic analysis of four Chinese patients",
      "content": "Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome (BRPS, OMIM #615485) is a rare, heterogeneous autosomal dominant genetic disease that is mainly characterized by intellectual disability (ID) of varying degrees, developmental delay (DD), language impairments, failure to thrive, behavioral issues, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and distinctive craniofacial features. It is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the additional sex combs-like 3 (ASXL3, OMIM #615115) gene. In this study, four Chinese patients were diagnosed with BRPS caused by ASXL3 variants through whole exome sequencing. We detected two novel and two previously reported variants of the ASXL3 gene (NM_030632.3) in these 4 unrelated Chinese patients: two novel variants, namely, c.1276del (p.Val426*) and c.3750del (p.Glu1251Asnfs*5), and two recurrent variants, namely, c.4330C>T (p.Arg1444*) and c.4336_4337delAG (p.Arg1446fs*2). All four patients had a clinical profile similar to that associated with BRPS. Compared with previously reported cases of BRPS, these patients exhibited novel complications, including long eyelashes, congenital laryngeal cartilage hypoplasia and dextrocardia. These findings broaden our understanding of the mutational and clinical spectrum of BRPS, emphasizing the importance of long-term monitoring and vigilance regarding potential complications, such as cardiac abnormalities, in BRPS patients.",

      "title": "Altered gut fungal microbiota and associated mycotoxins in juvenile rat offspring induced by maternal immune activation with Poly I:C",
      "content": "BackgroundMaternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) in offspring. While MIA-induced changes in the gut bacterial communities of offspring and their metabolites have been linked to behavioral abnormalities, the effects of MIA on the gut fungal communities and their mycotoxin-associated metabolites in offspring remain poorly characterized.MethodsIn this study, MIA was modeled in pregnant rats through intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg Poly I:C on gestational day 15. The model\u2019s efficacy was validated using behavioral assessments, including the open-field test, elevated plus maze, and Morris water maze. Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis were employed to detect the alterations of gut fungal microbiota and mycotoxin levels.ResultsPoly I:C-exposed offspring exhibited increased anxiety and cognitive deficits. Meanwhile, Poly I:C induces sex-related differences in gut fungal communities and mycotoxin levels in juvenile offspring rats. Several fungal genera and mycotoxins were significantly correlated with variations in anxiety-like behaviors and spatial learning performance.DiscussionOur findings suggest that MIA-induced behavioral deficits in offspring are accompanied by sex-specific disruptions in gut fungal composition and mycotoxin metabolism, which highlights the need for further intervention studies to establish causality and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of gut fungi and mycotoxins in NDDs.",
