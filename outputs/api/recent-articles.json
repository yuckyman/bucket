      "title": "Successful single-session neural self-regulation through neurofeedback varies between features",
      "content": "Neurofeedback (NFB) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) research seldom present within-session individual learning dynamics. This is even though a large proportion of NFB and BCI users cannot learn the neural self-regulation required to control the feedback. Understanding the time course and learning dynamics between subjects will enable us to design more effective NFB and BCI protocols that promote the learning of neural self-regulation. In this study, we aimed to analyze individual learning trajectories of self-regulation of four different cortical rhythms, in terms of both frequency and spatial selectivity. Twenty healthy subjects performed four sessions of NFB training, each session with feedback reflecting a different cortical rhythm as measured with an electroencephalogram. We specifically tested frontal midline (fm) Theta, occipital Alpha, unilateral centrotemporal sensorimotor rhythms (SMR), and central Beta. We show that all subjects were able to self-regulate at least two of these features, however, with varied specificity in the spatial and frequency domains. Unexpectedly, we show that none of the subjects succeeded in regulating fm Theta. Using a clustering approach, we identified two different learning dynamics among the learners across features: a linear increase/decrease and a non-linear plateau-like trajectory. This is the first NFB study employing an intra-subject cross-over experimental design, enabling the direct comparison of neural self-regulation between multiple features. Our results provide important insights into the \"non-learner\" problem, showing that it is not a feature-universal personal trait. We further show feature-specific spatial and frequency selectivity of neural self-regulation, providing important considerations for future NFB protocols.",

      "title": "Consumption of processed foods impairs memory function through dietary advanced glycation end-products",
      "content": "Consumption of processed foods is associated with dementia, obesity, and other negative health outcomes. Sustained heat treatment, a common food processing approach to enhance flavor, induces the chemical Maillard reaction that promotes the formation of dietary advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). The neurocognitive impacts of consuming dietary AGEs are poorly understood. Here we modeled an AGE-rich diet through heat treatment fed to rats during adolescence, a critical period of neural development, to mechanistically evaluate the long-term impact of early life dietary AGEs on behavioral and neural processes. Consuming the AGE-rich diet impaired hippocampal-dependent memory function and altered the gut microbiome without inducing obesity or nonspecific behavioral deficits. AGE-induced memory deficits were coupled with impaired hippocampal glutamatergic synaptic neurotransmission and altered expression in the synapse-pruning complement system. Hippocampal synaptic deficits likely result from direct AGE-complement interactions, as our extended studies reveal competitive antagonist action of AGEs on complement receptors. Memory impairments were prevented by administration of the AGE-inhibitor, alagebrium, and by supplementation with an AGE-inhibiting bacterial taxon, Lactococcus lactis, which was depleted in the heat-treated diet. These findings reveal a functional connection between early life dietary AGEs, the microbiome, and memory impairments, thus illuminating mechanisms through which food processing negatively impacts neurocognition.",

      "title": "Bioengineered extracellular vesicles mitigate neuroinflammation by neutralizing pneumolysin and delaying disease onset in experimental pneumococcal meningitis",
      "content": "Bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening neurological disorder frequently caused by a Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) infection of the brain. Standard treatment consists of antibiotics to eliminate bacteria and dexamethasone to reduce inflammation. Despite this, mortality reaches 20% in treated individuals, and half of the survivors suffer long-term neurological sequelae. This is largely due to the poor capacity of antibiotics to reach the brain and the lack of antimicrobial treatment capable of neutralizing the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin (Ply). To address these limitations, we isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human HEK293T cells and evaluated their therapeutic potential in pneumococcal meningitis. Alongside wild-type EVs (WT.EVs), we bioengineered EVs to express RVG peptides (RVG.EV) for targeting neuronal acetylcholine receptors, signal incompetent IL-6 signal transducer (IL-6ST) decoy receptors (IL-6.EV) to block the pro-inflammatory signalling of IL-6, or EVs expressing both RVG peptides and IL-6ST (DB.EV). In vitro, all EVs reduced pneumococcal adhesion to neurons and mitigated cytotoxicity by binding and sequestering Ply. In a bacteremia-derived pneumococcal meningitis model, EV treatment significantly increased the survival of the mice without affecting bacterial load in the brain or the periphery. Among all groups, RVG.EV treatment was most effective in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release in the periphery and brain. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of bioengineered EVs, particularly RVG peptides expressing EVs, as an adjunctive treatment for pneumococcal meningitis thanks to their (i) sequestration and neutralization of Ply, (ii) increased blood-brain barrier crossing, and (iii) dampening of inflammation.",

      "title": "Temporal single-cell atlas of full-length Huntington's disease mouse model defines stage-specific signatures of corticostriatal dysfunction",
      "content": "Huntington's disease involves progressive corticostriatal dysfunction; however, the timing of region-specific transcriptional changes remains unresolved at cellular resolution. Here, we provide a temporal single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of striatum and motor cortex from zQ175 knock-in mice at 6 and 18 months. This full-length Huntingtin model enables staging of progressive circuit dysfunction. Striatal projection neurons show extensive early dysregulation with progressive striosomal identity erosion, whereas cortical pyramidal neuron dysfunction was layer-specific and coincided with motor symptom onset. By modeling genotype-dependent effects, we distinguish region- and cell type-specific signatures of core disease mechanisms from age-related changes and compensatory adaptations. Integrating gene co-expression and transcription factor regulatory networks, we predict candidate regulators of stage-specific dysfunction. These findings, validated across human HD and mouse model datasets, reveal temporal dynamics of disease pathogenesis in regionally distinct and interconnected neuronal populations, establishing a framework for understanding cell type-selective vulnerability.",

      "title": "Astrocytic Encoding of Threat in the Basolateral Amygdala",
      "content": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has long been implicated in threat detection and the generation of anxiety states. While previous experiments have demonstrated the important role of BLA principal neurons in driving anxiety-related behaviors, population-level recordings suggest that principal neurons encode broad exploratory states rather than anxiety per se. This discrepancy questions whether anxiety is indeed represented within the BLA, or if the BLA reflects a broader representation of behavioral states. Here, using simultaneous in vivo calcium recordings in both astrocytes and principal neurons in the BLA we find that in contrast to neurons, astrocytic activity provides a stable and scalable representation of threat-induced anxiety across an array of behavioral tasks. We find that the magnitude of astrocyte response to threatening stimuli is modulated by the individual anxiety levels of animals, and that exploration of anxiogenic environment can be decoded across multiple tasks using astrocyte activity alone. Our results shed light on a specialized encoding property of BLA astrocytes and establish these cells as key computational elements of threat processing in anxiety circuits.",

      "title": "Drowning a frog respiratory rhythm generator in a wash of excitation: State-dependent architecture of a ventilatory oscillator",
      "content": "Breathing begins at birth and continues to death, providing a unique system to understand the architecture of rhythm-generating circuits in vertebrates. In mammals and frogs, three discrete rhythmogenic brainstem nuclei appear essential for generating different phases of breathing, with individual neurons intrinsically tuned to each phase. This discrete multi-oscillator architecture differs fundamentally from the distributed spinal locomotor networks, where rhythmogenesis spans multiple segments and the active phase of individual neurons depends on network state. However, whether these discrete respiratory oscillators are strictly essential and whether the phase of their neurons remains constant across states is coming under increasing scrutiny. Here, we focus on the frog buccal oscillator, which shares anatomical and functional similarities with the mammalian preBotzinger Complex. We developed a technique to silence motor neurons in frogs and mapped premotor unit activity within and surrounding the putative buccal oscillator under standard conditions and during heightened network excitability. We found that increasing network excitation caused the rhythmically active area to expand, in part by converting premotor lung units into buccal units. Next, we located the buccal area using excitatory and inhibitory microinjections and established the minimum number of inhibitory injections required to suppress buccal bursts. We then increased network excitability and again tested whether inhibitory microinjections could suppress the rhythm. While inhibitory microinjections could reverse local excitatory effects, they were unable to abolish the buccal rhythm under elevated excitation. Our data shows that not only does the region containing rhythmic premotor buccal units enlarge as network excitation increases, but the essential requirement for a discrete, rudimentary buccal oscillator is also lost. Thus, although rostral-caudal segments of the frog brainstem generally contribute to discrete phases of ventilatory motor patterns, our findings suggest that oscillator identity should be refined: oscillators should be viewed as promiscuous flexible functional entities that expand or contract to occupy different extents of the brainstem, rather than as fixed anatomical nuclei.",

The YSA features raster plots, automated discharge detection and tracking, downsampling, playback, and export functions, enabling streamlined workflows for large-scale neural data. We demonstrate the utility of the tool in the context of seizure and status epilepticus (SE)-like activity, highlighting how the YSA facilitates rapid exploration of the spatiotemporal dynamics in brain networks.

      "title": "Novel model combining intrinsic and learned behaviours captures divergent effects of dopaminergic drugs on different types of motivation",
      "content": "Motivation-based symptoms occur in an array of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Schizophrenia and Parkinson's Disease. Unfortunately, there is, as yet, no agreed treatment approach. To establish a better understanding of motivation, and so highlight potential avenues for treatment, motivation is often investigated using operant behavioural paradigms such as the Effort for Reward (EfR) task. Performance on these tasks is thought to be influenced by reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms, such that disorders of motivation can be described in terms of altered interactions with RL processes. Recently, foraging behaviour has been increasingly adopted as an ethologically valid approach to investigating cognitive mechanisms, including motivation. One example of this is the recently developed Effort Based Foraging task (EBF). Foraging behaviour, unlike the strictly controlled and contrived operant behavioural paradigms, involves a series of complex behavioural processes, each potentially driven by different cognitive processes. It is therefore important to identify which portion of the foraging behavioural sequence is driven by the same RL mechanisms as classical operant behavioural paradigms, and therefore can be used to investigate motivation. In this work we set out to establish whether the same RL mechanisms could be used to account for behaviours observed in both EfR and EBF tasks. We identified where, within the EBF task, RL mechanisms were no long sufficient and developed a novel hybrid model of the behaviour. This model successfully accounted for external influences on motivation, including previously unpredicted effects of clinically used dopaminergic drugs. This work reveals that motivation in complex, naturalistic tasks cannot be fully explained by learning-based models alone. Incorporating intrinsic behavioural drives may be needed as neuroscience moves toward more ethological behavioural assays.",
