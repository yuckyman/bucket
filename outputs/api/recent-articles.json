      "title": "Tuberous sclerosis complex, epilepsy, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis: a pilot study of shared and divergent microbial signatures",
      "content": "ObjectiveTuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) presents with a broad clinical spectrum. While some individuals exhibit mild symptoms, most experience seizures and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. Emerging evidence suggests that both genetic and environmental factors, including gut microbiota, may influence epilepsy susceptibility. The microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis (MGBA) is a key communication pathway through which intestinal microbes impact the central nervous system. Although the role of the MGBA in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, particularly seizures, has been explored in both animal models and humans, data specific to TSC are lacking.MethodsIn this exploratory study, we assessed whether individuals with TSC (n\u202f=\u202f15) display a distinct gut microbial signature using V3\u2013V4 16S rRNA sequencing. Their profiles were compared with two control groups: 18 children with epilepsy (EPI) and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). Stool short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels and dietary intake were also evaluated.ResultsNo significant differences were observed among the three groups in dietary intake, SCFA and branched-chain fatty acid (BCFA) levels, or alpha-diversity. Beta-diversity analysis showed a non-significant trend toward clustering of TSC and EPI samples, indicating a shared microbial profile distinct from HC. Taxonomic analysis revealed a reduction in Firmicutes\u2014particularly the Ruminococcaceae family and the genus Gemmiger\u2014in both TSC and EPI groups, consistent with epilepsy-associated dysbiosis. Notably, the TSC group showed a specific enrichment in Akkermansiaceae, a feature also reported in other neurodevelopmental disorders such as CDKL5 deficiency disorder and cerebral palsy.SignificanceThese preliminary findings suggest that gut microbiota alterations may contribute to neuroinflammatory processes linked to epileptogenesis and comorbidities in TSC. Further studies are needed to validate these results and explore microbiota-based therapeutic strategies aimed at improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals with TSC and their caregivers.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working on a small side project called <strong>virtualshell</strong> and wanted to share it here in case it\u2019s useful to anyone mixing Python and PowerShell.</p> <p>Repo (source + docs): <a href=\"https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell\">https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell</a></p> <p>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/virtualshell/\">https://pypi.org/project/virtualshell/</a></p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>In short: <strong>virtualshell lets Python talk to a persistent PowerShell process</strong>, instead of spawning a new one for every command.</p> <ul> <li>You <code>pip install virtualshell</code> and work with a <code>Shell</code> class from Python.</li> <li>Under the hood, a C++ backend manages a long-lived PowerShell process.</li> <li>State is preserved between calls (variables, functions, imported modules, env vars, etc.).</li> <li>It also has an optional <strong>zero-copy shared-memory bridge</strong> on Windows for moving large blobs/objects without re-serializing over stdout.</li> </ul> <p>Very minimal example:</p> <pre><code>from virtualshell import Shell with Shell(timeout_seconds=5, set_UTF8=True) as sh: result = sh.run(&quot;Get-Date&quot;) print(result.out.strip(), result.exit_code) # State is kept between calls: sh.run(&quot;$global:counter++&quot;) print(sh.run(&quot;$counter&quot;).out.strip()) </code></pre> <p>From the Python side you mainly get:</p> <ul> <li><code>Shell.run()</code> / <code>run_async()</code> / <code>script()</code> / <code>script_async()</code> - run commands or scripts, sync or async</li> <li>Structured result objects: <code>out</code>, <code>err</code>, <code>exit_code</code>, <code>ok</code>, <code>duration_ms</code></li> <li>Config options for which host to use (<code>pwsh</code> vs <code>powershell.exe</code>), working directory, env, etc.</li> <li>Zero-copy helpers for sending/receiving big byte buffers or serialized PowerShell objects (Windows only for now)</li> </ul> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is <strong>not</strong> meant as a big \u201cframework\u201d, more like a glue tool for a fairly specific niche:</p> <ul> <li>People using <strong>Python as the main orchestrator</strong>, but who still rely on PowerShell for: <ul> <li>existing scripts/modules</li> <li>Windows automation tasks</li> <li>Dev/ops tooling that is already PowerShell-centric</li> </ul></li> <li>Long-running services, data pipelines, or test harnesses that: <ul> <li>don\u2019t want to pay the cost of starting a new PowerShell process each time</li> <li>want to keep session state alive across many calls</li> </ul></li> <li>Windows users who occasionally need to move <strong>large amounts of data</strong> between PowerShell and Python and care about overhead.</li> </ul> <p>At this stage I still consider it a <strong>serious side project / early-stage library</strong>: it\u2019s usable, but I fully expect rough edges and would not claim it\u2019s \u201cbattle-tested in production\u201d yet.</p> <h1>Comparison (How It Differs From Existing Alternatives)</h1> <p>There are already several ways to use PowerShell from Python, so this is just another take on the problem:</p> <ul> <li><strong>vs. plain</strong> <code>subprocess</code> <strong>calls</strong> <ul> <li>With <code>subprocess.run(&quot;pwsh \u2026&quot;)</code> you pay process start-up cost and lose state after each call.</li> <li>virtualshell keeps a <strong>single long-lived process</strong> and tracks commands, timing, and exit codes in a higher-level API.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>vs. using PowerShell only / no Python</strong> <ul> <li>If your main logic/tooling is in Python (data processing, web services, tests), this lets you call into PowerShell where it makes sense without switching your whole stack.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>vs. other interop solutions (e.g., COM, pythonnet, remoting libraries, etc.)</strong> <ul> <li>Those are great for deep integration or remoting scenarios.</li> <li>My focus here is a <strong>simple, local, script-friendly API</strong>: <code>Shell.run()</code>, structured results, and an optional performance path (shared memory) when you need to move bigger payloads.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>Performance-wise, the zero-copy path is mainly there to avoid serializing tens of MB through stdout/stderr. It\u2019s still early, so I\u2019m very interested in real-world benchmarks from other machines and setups.</p> <p>If anyone has feedback on:</p> <ul> <li>parts of the API that feel un-Pythonic,</li> <li>missing use cases I haven\u2019t thought about, or</li> <li>things that would make it safer/easier to adopt in real projects,</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate it.</p> <p>Again, the source and docs are here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell\">https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chamoswor\"> /u/Chamoswor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ozf67i/project_virtualshell_keep_a_longlived_powershell/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ozf67i/project_virtualshell_keep_a_longlived_powershell/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It currently provides:</p> <ul> <li>2-D formats: <strong>CSR, CSC, COO</strong></li> <li>N-D tensors: <strong>COOND</strong> (N-dimensional COO)</li> <li>Kernels for <code>float64</code> values / <code>int64</code> indices: <ul> <li>SpMV / SpMM</li> <li>Reductions: total sum, row/column sums</li> <li>Transpose</li> <li>Arithmetic: add, sub, Hadamard (elementwise)</li> <li>Cleanup: <code>prune(eps)</code>, <code>eliminate_zeros</code></li> </ul></li> <li>N-D COO ops: <ul> <li><code>sum</code>, <code>mean</code></li> <li><code>reduce_*_axes</code>, <code>permute_axes</code>, <code>reshape</code></li> <li>broadcasting Hadamard</li> <li>unfold to CSR/CSC along a mode or grouped axes</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>The Python API is designed to work smoothly with NumPy, using zero-copy reads of input buffers when it\u2019s safe.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Lacuna is intended for people who:</p> <ul> <li>Work with <strong>large sparse matrices or tensors</strong> (e.g. scientific computing, FEM/CFD, graph problems, PageRank, power iterations)</li> <li>Need <strong>high-performance kernels</strong> but want to stay in Python/NumPy world</li> <li>Are interested in experimenting with <strong>N-D sparse arrays</strong> (beyond 2-D matrices) without densifying</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s currently a <strong>work-in-progress</strong> project (APIs and performance characteristics may change), so it\u2019s best suited for experimentation, research, and early adopters rather than critical production workloads.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>SciPy.sparse</strong> <ul> <li>Very mature and battle-tested for 2-D sparse linear algebra.</li> <li>Mainly matrix-first: N-D use cases often require reshaping or densifying.</li> <li>Lacuna aims to complement this with N-D COO tensors plus explicit unfold operations, while still providing fast CSR/CSC/COO kernels.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>PyData/Sparse (</strong><code>sparse</code><strong>)</strong> <ul> <li>Provides N-D COO arrays with NumPy-like semantics and broadcasting.</li> <li>Lacuna takes a more \u201ckernel-first\u201d approach: Rust + SIMD + Rayon, with a tighter set of operations focused on performance (SpMV/SpMM, reductions, transforms) and explicit unfold to CSR/CSC for linear-algebra-style workloads.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re already comfortable with NumPy and SciPy.sparse, Lacuna is meant to feel familiar but give you more explicit tools for N-D sparse tensors and high-performance kernels.</p> <p><strong>Source &amp; Docs</strong></p> <ul> <li>Source code: <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/hanziwww/lacuna\"><code>https://github.com/hanziwww/lacuna</code></a></li> <li>Docs &amp; examples: <a href=\"https://lacuna.hanziwww.me/\">https://lacuna.hanziwww.me</a></li> </ul> <p>Status: <strong>in active development</strong>. Feedback, issues, and contributors are very welcome \u2014 especially benchmark reports or workloads where sparse performance really matters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Effective-Phone6955\"> /u/Effective-Phone6955 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p02oi1/lacuna_highperformance_sparse_matrices_for_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p02oi1/lacuna_highperformance_sparse_matrices_for_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",
