      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I had this Idea for over 3 years already. One time my manager called me at 3 AM on Friday and he was furious, the app I was working on crashed in production because of an unhandled error, while he was demoing it to a huge prospect. The app was using a document parsing lib that had infinite amount of edge cases (documents are messy, you can't even imagine how messy they can be). Now I finally implemented this idea. It's called Pyrethrin.</p> <ul> <li><strong>What My Project Does</strong> - It's a library that lets you create functions that explicitly define what exceptions it can raise or that it can return a None, and the other function using this one has to exhaustively implement all the cases, if any handle is missing or not handled at all, Pyrethrin will throw an error at &quot;compile&quot; time (on the first run in case of Python).</li> <li><strong>Target Audience</strong> - the tool is primarily designed for production use, especially in large Python teams. Other target audience is Python library developers, they can &quot;shield&quot; their library for their users to gain their trust (it will fail on their end way less than without Pyrethrin)</li> <li><strong>Comparison</strong> - I haven't seen anything like this, if you know an alternative please let me know.</li> </ul> <p>Go check it out, don't forget to star if you like it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin\">https://github.com/4tyone/pyrethrin</a></p> <p>Edit: Here is the core static analyzer repo.
