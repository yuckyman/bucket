      "title": "A neurorecording toolkit for longitudinal assessments of transplanted human cortical organoids in vivo",
      "content": "Human cortical organoids (hCOs) are three-dimensional neural cell aggregates that recapitulate certain structural and functional aspects of the developing human cortex. Xenotransplantation of hCOs into the rodent brain enables human-centric modeling of neurodevelopmental processes in a physiologically relevant environment. Here, we present a neurorecording toolkit for longitudinal structural and functional assessment of hCO xenografts as they mature in vivo. Single hCOs were implanted into the retrosplenial cortex of adult immunodeficient mice and monitored for up to 8 months. Optical coherence tomography was used for label-free imaging of xenograft vascularization and structure, enabling quantitative assessments of capillary density and graft volume. To probe neuronal activity, human neurons were labeled with a calcium sensor before implantation using either adeno-associated or lentivirus for sparse or dense neuronal labeling, respectively. Fluorescent imaging was conducted using two-photon, widefield, and swept confocally-aligned planar excitation microscopy for single cell, whole-graft, and volumetric calcium imaging, respectively. Results from these modalities indicate an increase in neuronal activity and synchronicity over time during in vivo graft maturation. Further, we chronically implanted surface graphene microelectrode arrays (gMEAs) and performed recordings of xenograft and host local field potential signals simultaneously with 2P calcium imaging, confirming the spatial localization and human origin of electrical signals recorded at the xenograft surface.",

      "title": "Adjacent Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) Regions Participate in Distinct Large-Scale Networks Differentially Recruited for Social and Cognitive Control Functions",
      "content": "Human prefrontal cortex (PFC) is heterogenous. In monkeys, side-by-side PFC regions, including within dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), show distinct long-range anatomical projection profiles, raising the possibility that adjacent regions might specialize as a consequence of the distributed networks in which they are embedded. Consistent with this possibility, recent findings in humans provide evidence for PFC regions domain-specialized for scene (spatial) processing and language processing that are adjacent to distinct domain-flexible regions responding to traditional cognitive control demands. Here we tested functional specialization of PFC regions linked to another domain-specialized network recruited by certain forms of social processing (theory-of-mind, ToM, tasks). Using within-individual precision neuroimaging approaches, side-by-side DLPFC regions embedded within parallel distributed networks were identified within the idiosyncratic anatomy of each individual (N=13). Functional responses between these distinct regions revealed a robust functional double dissociation: one DLPFC region was preferentially recruited by ToM tasks and an adjacent DLPFC region by working memory task demands. The region responding to social processing demands was small and its position varied slightly from one person to the next suggesting why it may have been underappreciated in past group-based analyses. These findings add to evidence that PFC features more functional specialization than commonly appreciated and further that the specialization of juxtaposed regions within PFC can be understood by examining the distributed networks within which the regions are embedded.",

      "content": "Long-range white matter (WM) tracts support cognition by enabling communication between distant cortical regions, which are organized along a hierarchy defined by the sensorimotor-to-association (S-A) axis. However, it remains unknown how WM tracts are positioned within the cortical hierarchy to support cognition. Here, we show that WM tracts are differentially positioned in the cortical hierarchy to support specific cognitive functions, and that tracts spanning the hierarchy connect regions with greater cognitive diversity. Moreover, tracts situated within the same hierarchical level connect biologically similar regions, while those crossing the hierarchy bridge distinct biological milieux to support diverse cognitive functions. The placement of tracts in the cortical hierarchy also reflects developmental variation in tract microstructure and individual differences in cognition. Together, these findings provide a framework that moves beyond conventional categories of association or projection tracts and links WM tract anatomy to cortical organization, cognitive function, cortical neurobiology, and neurodevelopment. We anticipate that this cortex-anchored framework for describing WM tracts may aid the interpretation of individual differences in WM structure related to development and behavior.",

      "title": "Integration of gene expression with computational modeling reveals region-specific brain energy metabolism dysregulation in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Schizophrenia is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder with suggested disturbances in multiple neurobiological pathways including brain energy metabolism, which is essential for sustaining precise neuronal signaling. The relationship between gene expression alterations and energy metabolism defects, however, is poorly understood. Here we combined differential expression (DE) analysis with computational modeling to investigate how the expression of cytosolic energy metabolism-associated genes influences the concentrations of key energy metabolites. The DE analysis used human post-mortem RNA sequencing data from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from the Common Mind Consortium. Metabolic simulations were carried out using a biophysical model of brain energy metabolism (Winter et al. 2018). We conducted both population-average and subject-specific simulations and assessed the effects of DE genes individually and collectively.  The DE analysis identified nine genes in the ACC and 24 in the DLPFC. Approximately two thirds of the DE genes were downregulated in schizophrenia in both brain areas. Decreased expression of neuronal  LDHB  in the ACC caused a decrease of pyruvate and an increase of NAD+/NADH ratio. Furthermore, decreased expression of neuronal PFKM in the DLPFC caused an increase of glucose and NAD+/NADH ratio and a decrease of pyruvate, lactate, and ATP. These findings provide evidence for region-specific dysregulation of brain energy metabolism in schizophrenia and suggest mechanistic links between gene expression changes and altered levels of key energy metabolites.",

      "title": "Amyloid-beta relates to default and attention network connectivity during working memory retrieval",
      "content": "As one of the earliest pathological events in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-beta accumulation has been linked to alterations in large-scale brain networks, especially the default mode network. While most prior work has focused on resting-state functional connectivity or task-evoked activation, how amyloid-beta relates to task-modulated connectivity that directly supports behavior is less explored. Here, we examined the relationship between amyloid-beta burden and task-modulated connectivity during a Letter Sternberg verbal working-memory task in eighty-four cognitively normal older adults from an ongoing longitudinal cohort (age 56-71 years; 41 female). To further understand these connectivity alterations, we tested whether these connections were associated with task performance or with cognitive reserve factors. We found that higher amyloid-beta burden was associated with reduced connectivity specifically during the probe phase of working-memory retrieval. At the regional scale, lower node strength in posterior-medial regions of the default mode network was related to worse task performance and mediated the amyloid-behavior relationship. At the network scale, altered coupling between the default mode and dorsal attention networks was related to task performance but did not mediate the amyloid-behavior relationship. Moreover, physical activity was associated with network-level coupling but not with regional node strength. These findings suggest that amyloid-beta burden disrupts retrieval-related working-memory systems, particularly regions of the default mode network that are vulnerable to amyloid-beta, while coupling between the default mode and dorsal attention networks indexes resilience. Collectively, task-modulated connectivity provides insight into pathways through which early Alzheimer's disease pathology influences working-memory performance and resilience and may inform targeted lifestyle or neuromodulation interventions for older adults.",

      "title": "Unveiling the secrets of brain resilience: Multimodal neuroimaging insights into Neural dynamics and neuroprotection in ageing",
      "content": "With the onset of ageing the likelihood of brain degeneration increases but so does the remarkable capability of the brain to reorganize itself termed as neurocognitive resilience. Leveraging the neuroimaging mapped anatomical signatures to demarcate age related alteration of an individual brain is a promising strategy to identify ageing phenotypes and estimate the molecular cues account for coping mechanisms. This study endeavour to identifying neuroprotective signatures using multimodal structural and functional brain scans of healthy aged male and female cohort across dorsal-ventral pathways of neuronal signal processing. To obtain multifarious insight across numerous patho physiological process we employed cutting edge approaches such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI) and vascular MRI (cerebrovascular reactivity). From the study we obtained several unexpected anatomical and physiological neuro-protective features in the older cohort. Overall, we observed that older cohort exhibit better circum-cerebral structural connectivity as (i) cuneus to superior frontal gyrus (ii) superior frontal gyrus to inferior frontal gyrus (iii) inferior temporal gyrus to inferior frontal gyrus and (iv) cuneus to inferior temporal gyrus. Another, significant neuroprotective anatomical signature was revealed, namely a connectivity through vertical occipital fasciculus across cuneus to temporal cortex in male and female older cohort. Additionally, in older female we observed a pronounced increment in overall functional connectivity network observed in inferior frontal gyrus (both hemispheres). Whereas in older male a substantial increment of functional connectivity network in cuneus was observed as compared to their younger counterpart.",

      "title": "Sensorimotor dynamics differentiate singing and speaking",
      "content": "Singing and speaking often dissociate clinically--people who stutter can sing fluently, and individuals with aphasia and speech output problems from stroke may express sentences fluently in song--yet the neural mechanisms of this centuries-old clinical phenomenon remain unclear. We recorded intracranial EEG while neurosurgical patients produced matched sentences by singing or speaking, sampling millimeter- and millisecond-scale activity across bilateral sensorimotor cortex (SMC). During articulation, high-frequency activity (70-150 Hz) lateralized oppositely across behaviors, with right-dominant SMC activation for singing and left-dominant activation for speaking. Mu-band (~10 Hz) synchrony further differentiated the dynamics: speaking showed an early left-led pattern, whereas singing exhibited a ramping of synchrony within the left sensorimotor cortex and between the two motor cortices, supporting progressive interhemispheric recruitment. Frequency-domain Granger-Geweke causality revealed that the left primary somatosensory cortex drives both motor cortices at speech onset. In contrast in singing, control over motor cortices relied on both hemispheres. These results provide evidence that song and speech rely on dissociable sensorimotor dynamics. This bilaterally coordinated SMC pathway may enable preserved singing in individuals with impaired speech output.",

      "title": "From iPSCs to NPCs to cortical neurons: bioenergetic, neuronal, and calcium signaling phenotypes in bipolar disorder with and without familial mitochondrial disease",
      "content": "Background: Psychiatric disorders frequently accompany primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs), implicating mitochondrial dysfunction as a shared biological substrate for psychiatric vulnerability. To determine how familial mitochondrial risk influences neuronal development in bipolar disorder (BD), we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and cortical neurons (CNs) from three healthy controls (CT), three patients with BD, and three patients with BD and a family history of mitochondrial disease (BD-FMD). Methods: Across differentiation, we assessed mitochondrial function (ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS generation, cytosolic cell-free mtDNA), metabolomic signatures, calcium imaging, and neuronal electrophysiological activity through multi-electrode arrays (MEA). Results: BD neurons uniquely exhibited pronounced hyperexcitability in comparison to CT and BD-FMD groups. The BD-FMD group displayed prolonged mitochondrial calcium transients, altered membrane potential, and aberrant ROS, in comparison to CT and BD, consistent with a sustained energetic deficit. Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct pathway enrichments in BD and BD-FMD, indicating divergent bioenergetic adaptations to mitochondrial burden. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that familial mitochondrial liability actively reshapes neuronal differentiation and function, producing distinct trajectories of mitochondrial performance, calcium signaling, and network excitability. These results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in BD is not a secondary byproduct of illness, but a mechanistic contributor to altered neuronal energetics and communication. Together, these findings delineate how inherited mitochondrial vulnerability reshapes neuronal excitability and metabolism, revealing bioenergetic phenotypes that may inform precision stratification and therapeutic targeting in BD.",
