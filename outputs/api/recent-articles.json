      "title": "A review of the application of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of facial paralysis",
      "content": "Facial paralysis (FP), as a highly prevalent neurological dysfunction disease worldwide, has long faced challenges such as strong subjectivity in assessment and difficulty in quantifying therapeutic effects in its clinical diagnosis and treatment. Traditional scales rely on physicians\u2019 experience. Neuroelectrophysiological examinations are invasive, while imaging evaluations are costly. The rise of intelligent sensing technology provides a new path to break through these limitations. Intelligent sensing technology has significantly improved the accuracy of FP recognition and assessment through multi-modal data fusion and dynamic monitoring. Its clinical value is not only reflected in the improvement of diagnostic efficiency, but also in promoting a fundamental change in the diagnosis and treatment model of FP. The artificial intelligence-assisted analysis mainly focuses on using machine learning algorithms to conduct in-depth exploration and analysis of the surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals of patients with facial paralysis, the motion trajectory data obtained through three-dimensional (3D) motion capture, as well as the data from patients\u2019 self-assessment scales. This study systematically reviews the innovative applications of intelligent sensing technology in the recognition and evaluation of FP, focusing on three major technical directions: sEMG, 3D motion capture, and artificial intelligence assisted analysis.",

      "title": "Spike-based time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model for extremely low power VLSI implementation of multi-layer neural networks",
      "content": "In deep neural network (DNN) models, the weighted summation, or multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation, is an essential and heavy calculation task, which leads to high power consumption in current digital processors. The use of analog operation in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits is a promising method for achieving extremely low power-consumption operation for such calculation tasks. In this paper, a time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model is proposed based on an integrate-and-fire-type spiking neuron model. The proposed calculation model is applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with positive and negative weights are separately performed, and two timings proportional to the positive and negative ones are produced, respectively, in each layer. The timings are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction operation. We also propose VLSI circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low power consumption. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS circuit to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights. Simulation results showed that the precision was above 4-bit, and the energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 237.7 Tera Operations Per Second Per Watt (TOPS/W), more than one order of magnitude higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors. Our model promises to be a suitable approach for performing intensive in-memory computing (IMC) of DNNs with moderate precision very energy-efficiently while reducing the cost of analog-digital-converter (ADC) overhead.",

      "content": "Driver distraction is a key factor contributing to traffic accidents. However, in existing computer vision-based methods for driver attention state recognition, monocular camera-based approaches often suffer from low accuracy, while multi-sensor data fusion techniques are compromised by poor real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Real-time Driver Attention State Recognition method (RT-DASR). RT-DASR comprises two core components: Binocular Vision...",

      "content": "Video denoising in extremely low-light surveillance scenarios is a challenging task in computer vision, as it suffers from harsh noise and insufficient signal to reconstruct fine details. The denoising algorithm for these scenarios encounters challenges such as the lack of ground truth, and the noise distribution in the real world is far more complex than in a normal scene. Consequently, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like VRT and Turtle for video denoising perform poorly in this...",

These factors significantly degrade the performance of sensor- and vision-based crack detection systems. In moist environments, the initiation and propagation of cracks tend to be highly nonlinear and irregular, making it challenging to distinguish crack regions from the background-especially under visual noise such as reflections, stains, and...",

Although many scholars used to fuse these two networks, most integration focuses on image segmentation with U-Net, overlooking the capabilities of ResNet for image classification.
