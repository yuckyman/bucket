      "title": "Spatially resolved transcriptome-metabolome integration reveals region-specific glial lipid dysregulation associated with Alzheimer's pathology",
      "content": "Glial cells maintain the brain's lipid and energy balance, and their breakdown is increasingly recognized as a causal contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). While this concept is established, no approach has directly shown how glial homeostatic failure manifests across brain regions and microenvironments or how it links local pathology, such as plaques, to global metabolic imbalance. To address this gap, we developed iMIST, an integrated platform that combines MALDI-based metabolite imaging, histology, and spatial transcriptomics within a single tissue section to align molecular and anatomical information. Using a mouse model of late-onset AD that recapitulates both amyloid deposition and metabolic vulnerability, iMIST revealed that glial lipid dysregulation is widespread but spatially specialized. In gray matter, plaque-associated microglia were associated with upregulated glycerophospholipid-remodeling in cortico-thalamic areas indicating metabolic stress around local pathology. In contrast, white matter tracts rich in lipid-producing oligodendrocytes show plaque-independent deficits in galactosylceramide metabolism reflecting their high myelin demand. Both processes intensify with age, transforming adaptive glial responses into persistent metabolic dysfunction. Together, these findings demonstrate the spatial interplay between global glial metabolic imbalance and local microenvironmental stressors associated with AD pathology. By integrating transcriptomic and metabolomic information in situ, iMIST provides a framework for uncovering how regional glial vulnerability shapes the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "The compositional nature of the human alpha rhythm",
      "content": "Resting-state brain activity is dominated by oscillations in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). The dominant frequency within this band, the individual alpha peak frequency (IAPF), has been widely used as a global marker of inter-individual variability in perceptual and cognitive functions, as well as clinical phenotypes. However, the traditional approach implicitly assumes a single oscillatory rhythm varying along a parametric continuum. Here, we analyzed resting-state EEG data from more than 2000 participants across multiple independent datasets. We identify three distinct and highly stable alpha components, or archetypes, that jointly and compositionally determine the IAPF. These components exhibit dissociable age-related trajectories as well as distinct scalp topographies and cortical sources. Together, these findings indicate that individual differences in alpha activity do not reflect variation along a single frequency dimension, but rather differences in the relative contribution of discrete alpha generators. This calls for a reevaluation of many reported associations between alpha frequency, brain function, and clinical phenotypes.",
