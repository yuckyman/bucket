      "title": "Structural basis of CO2 valence coding in Drosophila",
      "content": "In the olfactory system, glomerular sensory channels of single receptor identity support reliable odor recognition for appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors. For many olfactory stimuli, the assigned sensory value is innate but weighted by the internal state and previous experiences. How context-dependent modulation of innate valence coding supports distinct behavioral responses is poorly understood. Here we show that CO2 sensory information in Drosophila, intrinsically aversive but modified by attractive food signals, diverges from the canonical glomerular channel already in the antennal lobe via the polarized local interneuron LN23. LN23 relays sensory input via an extraglomerular CO2 pathway and manipulation of LN23 activity revealed a dominant role in CO2-induced avoidance behavior. The extraglomerular CO2 pathway projects to the posterior lateral protocerebrum (PLP) adjacent to the canonical Lateral Horn (LH) olfactory processing center and segregates into anatomically distinct valence channels. Connectome data together with functional characterization showed the convergence of parallel CO2 channels onto two interconnected 3rd order neurons which integrate additional sensory modalities via distinct mechanisms: while the glomerular CO2 pathway converge with food relay neurons onto separated dendritic domains of the PD5 interneuron in the LH, the extraglomerular pathways integrating CO2 information with antennal humidity and temperature modalities establish antagonistic inputs onto the PLP interneuron PV9. This early anatomical divergence of a defined olfactory channel followed by separated multimodal integration provides a structural basis for context-dependent valence coding and appropriate behavioral responses.",

      "title": "Context-Dependent Motor Feedback Underlies Choice-Related signals in Visual Cortex",
      "content": "Choice-related neural activity, reflecting trial-by-trial correlation with subjects perceptual choice, is commonly observed in sensory cortices and has been implied in sensory readout. Recent studies suggest an alternative source from motor-reporting, yet its precise nature remain elusive due to limitations in conventional experimental paradigms. Here we quantitatively identified motor component by training macaques to discriminate visual motion directions via making saccade to spatial-independent, colored choice targets appeared under two contexts: at stimulus onset, or after its offset. Neural recordings in visual areas MT/MST revealed a dominant motor-related choice signal when the saccade goal was known in advance; this signal vanished with delayed target onset. By comparing with downstream sensory-motor transformation areas and employing a recurrent network model, we demonstrated that this motor component reflected feedback. Our work clarifies that a major portion of \"decision\" activity in sensory neurons is attributable to motor-reporting processes, highlighting the profound influence of behavioral context.",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I recently shared this on r/BCI and wanted to see what the engineering community here thinks.<p>A while back, I got frustrated with the state of accessible BCI hardware. Research gear was wildly unaffordable. So, I spent a ton of time designing a custom board, software and firmware to bridge that gap. I call it the Cerelog ESP-EEG. It is open-source (Firmware + Schematics), and I designed it specifically to fix the signal integrity issues found in most DIY hardware.<p>I believe in sharing the work. You can find the Schematics, Firmware, and Software setup on the GitHub repo:\nGITHUB LINK: <a href=\"https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/ESP-EEG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Cerelog-ESP-EEG/ESP-EEG</a><p>For those who don't want to deal with BGA soldering or sourcing components, I do have assembled units available: <a href=\"https://www.cerelog.com/eeg_researchers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.cerelog.com/eeg_researchers.html</a><p>The major features: Forked/modified OpenBCI GUI Compatibility as well as Brainflow API, and LSL Compatibility. I know a lot of us rely on the OpenBCI GUI for visualization because it just works. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, so I ensured this board supports it natively.<p>It works out of the box: I maintain a forked modified version of the GUI that connects to the board via LSL (Lab Streaming Layer). Zero coding required: You can visualize FFTs, Spectrograms, and EMG widgets immediately without writing a single line of Python.<p>The \"active bias\" (why my signal is cleaner): The TI ADS1299 is the gold standard for EEG, but many dev boards implement it incorrectly. They often leave the Bias feedback loop \"open\" (passive), which makes them terrible at rejecting 60Hz mains hum. I simply followed the datasheet: I implemented a True Closed-Loop Active Bias (Drive Right Leg).<p>How it works: It measures the common-mode signal, inverts it, and actively drives it back into the body. The result: Cleaner data<p>Tech stack:<p><pre><code>  ADC: TI ADS1299 (24-bit, 8-channel).\n\n  MCU: ESP32 Chosen to handle high-speed SPI and WiFi/USB streaming\n\n  Software: BrainFlow support (Python, C++, Java, C#) for those who want to build custom ML pipelines, LSL support, and forked version of OpenBCI GUI support\n</code></pre>\nThis was a huge project for me. I\u2019m happy to geek out about getting the ESP32 to stream reliably at high sample rates as both the software and firmware for this project proved a lot more challenging than I expected. Let me know what you think!<p>SAFETY NOTE:\nI strongly recommend running this on a LiPo battery via WiFi. If you must use USB, please use a laptop running on battery power, not plugged into the wall.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46502051\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46502051</a></p>\n<p>Points: 14</p>\n<p># Comments: 5</p>",

      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Elements of Olfactory Intelligence in Drosophila",
      "content": "The ability to make the world of odorants intelligible is a key capability of the Drosophila olfactory system that we shall call olfactory intelligence. We argue that olfactory intelligence does not only arise in the form of associative learning in the Mushroom Body, but can be seen throughout the first three stages of the early olfactory system: the Antenna, the Antennal Lobe and the Mushroom Body Calyx, where encoding and processing of odorants take places. Characterizing the structure and logic of the code underlying the spike trains accessing the memory in the Mushroom Body is a major challenge in neuroscience. To address this challenge and unveil the key elements of olfactory intelligence, we extensively model the function of the Drosophila early olfactory system from its intriguing connectome. We start by modeling the space of odorants using constructs of both semantic and syntactic information. Odorant semantics concerns the identity of odorants while odorant syntax pertains to their concentration amplitude. These odorant attributes are multiplicatively coupled in the process of olfactory transduction. To make the world of odorants intelligible, we establish that the Drosophila Antennal Lobe and Calyx largely reduce the concentration dependency of the odorant information from the confounding representation of the Antenna, and thereby disentangle the odorant semantic information from the odorant syntactic information. We also introduce a novel time and rank-based representation of Kenyon Cell (KC) outputs, called the marked first spike sequence code. We compare the cumulative inter-spike interval statistics of odorant semantics and introduce a novel distance measure for the accurate classification of odorant semantics. Computationally, these elements of olfactory intelligence are realized by a class of differential divisive normalization processors (DNPs) modeling the feedback circuits in the Antennal Lobe facilitated by Local Neurons and in the Calyx by the Anterior Paired Lateral (APL) neuron. The marked first spike sequence code at the output of the DNP circuit of the Calyx provides a novel representation of the odorant semantics. The code reflects the amplitude ranking that drives the KCs in the time domain. Strikingly, the APL feedback not only removes the concentration dependency of the KC outputs, but also increases the ranking distance between the marked first spike sequence codes representing different odorant identities. Thus, the rank-based representation supports accurate classification of odorant semantics.",

      "title": "Ultrashort optical-pin excitation for scattering brain imaging",
      "content": "Imaging neural structures deep in brain tissue is central to understanding brain function, yet remains fundamentally limited by strong optical scattering and the requirement for accurate three-dimensional (3D) optical sectioning. Laser-scanning microscopy is a promising technique for brain imaging; however, maintaining excitation focus integrity in scattering media while preserving axial confinement poses a persistent photonic challenge. Here we introduce the optical pin, an ultrashort excitation regime engineered at the angular-spectrum level to address this limitation. By broadening the transverse angular bandwidth of a Bessel-type field while preserving its conical momentum-space architecture, the optical pin introduces a controlled longitudinal wave-vector spread that compresses the axial interference length to the micrometer scale, restoring Gaussian-like sectioning without sacrificing multi-angle interference. This excitation design yields substantially enhanced imaging performance, including ~1.5-fold contrast improvement and ~2.6-fold increased robustness to scattering. We validate the approach across transparent, scattering, and biological specimens, including bead phantoms, C. elegans, and mouse brain tissue. As a system-level excitation strategy, the optical pin is readily compatible with existing laser-scanning microscopy platforms and is particularly suited for scattering-limited brain imaging.",
