      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "title": "Phase-specific multimodal biomarkers enable explainable assessment of upper limb dysfunction in chronic stroke",
      "content": "BackgroundObjective and precise assessment of upper limb dysfunction post-stroke is critical for guiding rehabilitation. While promising, current methods using wearable sensors and machine learning (ML) often lack interpretability and neglect underlying, phase-specific kinetic deficits (e.g., muscle forces and joint torques) within functional tasks. This study aimed to develop and validate an explainable assessment framework that leverages musculoskeletal kinetic modeling to extract phase-specific, multimodal (kinematic and kinetic) biomarkers to assess upper limb dysfunction in chronic stroke.MethodsSixty-five adults with chronic stroke and 20 healthy controls performed a standardized hand-to-mouth (HTM) task. Stroke participants were allocated to a model-development cohort (n\u202f=\u202f47) and an independent test cohort (n\u202f=\u202f18). Using IMU and sEMG data, we employed musculoskeletal modeling to extract phase-specific kinematic (e.g., inter-joint coordination, trunk displacement) and kinetic (e.g., mechanical work, smoothness, co-contraction index) biomarkers from four task phases. A Lasso regression model was trained to predict FMA-UL scores, validated via 5-fold cross-validation and the independent test cohort. Explainable AI (SHAP) was used to identify key predictive features.ResultsCompared with controls, patients showed phase-specific alterations including greater trunk displacement and reduced inter-joint coordination and mechanical work (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The Lasso model achieved strong performance in internal validation (R2\u202f=\u202f0.932; MAE\u202f=\u202f0.799) and generalized well to the independent test cohort (R2\u202f=\u202f0.881; MAE\u202f=\u202f0.954). SHAP identified trunk displacement in phase 2 (TD_2), elbow\u2013shoulder coordination in phase 3 (IC_elb_elv_3), and trunk displacement in phase 3 (TD_3) as dominant predictors; larger trunk displacement contributed negatively to predicted FMA-UL scores.ConclusionIntegrating phase-specific multimodal biomarkers with explainable ML yields an interpretable upper-limb dysfunction. By highlighting phase-specific kinetic and kinematic targets (e.g., trunk compensation and inter-joint coordination), the framework supports individualized, precision rehabilitation.",

      "content": "Hemispheric brain asymmetries emerge in early life but continue to change over time. However, there is no consensus on whether asymmetries become weaker or stronger with age or which brain regions are most affected. Here, we set out to further explore age-related changes in brain asymmetry, with a particular focus on voxel-wise gray matter asymmetry. For this purpose, we selected a sample of 2,322 participants (1,150 women/1,172 men), aged between 47 and 80\u202fyears (mean 62.3\u202fyears), from the UK Biobank. Each participant was scanned twice; with an interval between baseline and follow-up scans ranging between 1 and 7\u202fyears (mean 2.4\u202fyears). Significant changes in asymmetry were observed, particularly in the temporal and occipital lobe, as well as the cerebellum. Overall, decreases in asymmetry were more prominent than increases, but with hemisphere-specific effects (i.e., leftward asymmetries decreased more than increased, while rightward asymmetries increased more than decreased). Changes in asymmetry were not significantly associated with chronological age or biological sex, suggesting that these changes neither accelerate nor decelerate with increasing age, and do not differ between the sexes. Follow-up research \u2013 potentially incorporating additional morphometric measures, different stages of life, and/or clinical populations \u2013 is necessary, not only to replicate the current findings but also to investigate changes over longer timeframes.",

      "title": "GABAergic neurons are a key cell type in a Drosophila model of PARK14/PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration",
      "content": "The causes of sporadic Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) are still unclear, despite its prevalence. By contrast, inherited parkinsonian disorders have a clear genetic basis and have been studied intensively in laboratory organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. Because inherited parkinsonian disorders clinically resemble sporadic PD, it has been suggested that they may share an underlying etiology. Loss of function mutations in the gene PLA2G6 give rise to inherited neurodegenerative diseases including autosomal recessive early onset parkinsonism (PARK14). Using RNAi to deplete the Drosophila PLA2G6 homolog iPLA2-VIA, we asked whether subsets of neurons, identified by their neurotransmitter usage, were more susceptible to loss of this gene. To model movement disorders connected with PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration, we used the well-established climbing assay. Our results demonstrated that loss of iPLA2-VIA in GABAergic neurons alone strongly affected locomotor ability in aged flies, similar to pan-neuronal knockdown. Depletion of iPLA2-VIA in both dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons weakly affected locomotor ability as well. Depletion in other neuronal subsets did not disrupt locomotion. Furthermore, reintroducing wild-type iPLA2-VIA into only the dopaminergic neurons of fly knockouts improved climbing performance slightly, while reintroduction into GABAergic neurons rescued climbing performance strikingly, as well as lifespan. Although much research on this gene has focused on the dopaminergic neurons, whose degeneration leads to clinical parkinsonism, our results highlight the importance of GABAergic neurons to PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration. Because sporadic PD is not thought to impact most GABAergic neurons directly, our data support the idea that sporadic PD and PARK14 have distinct etiologies despite overlapping clinical presentations.",

      "title": "From environment to brain: the role of microplastics in neurobehavioral disorders",
      "content": "In recent years, the pervasive presence of microplastics has attracted significant attention from the scientific community, particularly concerning their potential implications for human health. Current literature suggests that microplastics may adversely affect the nervous system, with emerging evidence linking them to neurobehavioral disorders. However, many questions remain regarding the pathways of their environmental exposure, the specific effects on neurobehavior, and the underlying mechanisms of their impact. This review aims to explore the routes through which humans are exposed to microplastics, monitor behavioral changes associated with microplastic exposure, and examine how these particles infiltrate the body and traverse the blood-brain barrier. Several perspectives will be considered in assessing the potential mechanisms by which microplastics may influence neurobehavioral disorders, including oxidative stress, neurotransmitter regulation, and neuroplasticity. The article concludes by summarizing the effects of microplastics on neurobehavioral disorders, such as neurodegeneration and mood disorders, while analyzing the latest research findings. The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the neurotoxic effects of microplastics and their potential biological mechanisms, as well as to provide new insights and recommendations for future research in this domain.",

      "title": "Comparative effectiveness of rhythmic grip training of various intensities on cognitive function in young adults: a fNIRS study",
      "content": "IntroductionResistance training has a significant influence on cognitive function. Rhythmic handgrip (RHG) exercise, a practical form of small-muscle group training, may improve cognitive performance. However, the effects of resistance training at various intensities on prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation and cognitive outcomes remain unclear.MethodsThis study recruited 24 healthy male participants (mean age: 22.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.31\u202fyears). Participants completed experiments at three intensity levels [30%, 50%, and 70% Maximum Voluntary Contraction (MVC)] in a randomized order, with one-week intervals between sessions. During dynamic handgrip resistance training, participants performed rhythmic fist contractions at the target intensity, maintaining a frequency of 1 Hz for 30 s, followed by 30 s of rest. Each training set consisted of four contraction-rest cycles, and participants completed three sets in total, separated by 3-min rest periods. Cognitive task testing including the Stroop task, 2-Back task, and More-Odd Shifting task, was administered before and after each intervention. Cognitive performance was evaluated using reaction time and accuracy measures. Simultaneously, functional near-infrared spectroscopy was employed to measure changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO2) levels in the prefrontal cortex during task execution.ResultsThe moderate-intensity (50% MVC) rhythmic handgrip task produced the greatest improvements in cognitive performance. Behaviorally, participants showed faster reaction times and higher accuracy than in low- (30% MVC) or high-intensity (70% MVC) conditions. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy results showed that moderate-intensity rhythmic handgrip enhanced the efficiency of prefrontal modulation, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus. The 50% MVC condition reduced oxygenated hemoglobin levels, indicating optimized neural efficiency and more effective cortical resource allocation during task performance.ConclusionModerate-intensity (50% MVC) RHG training significantly enhances executive function, working memory, and cognitive flexibility, while demonstrating more efficient neural activity. As a practical form of small-muscle-group training, moderate-intensity RHG resistance offers a promising early-intervention strategy for delaying cognitive decline and reducing dementia risk.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier ChiCTR2400083689.",

      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",
