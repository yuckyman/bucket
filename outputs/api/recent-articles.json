      "title": "Shedding light on left hippocampal mGlu5 in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) plays a central role in synaptic plasticity and memory, and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While asymmetries in hippocampal function have been observed in AD patients, the lateralized contribution of mGlu5 signaling to cognitive decline remains unclear. Here, we show the presence of a physiological left-right asymmetry in mGlu5 expression in the hippocampus of wild-type mice, with higher levels in the left hemisphere, consistent with previous observations. Importantly, we reveal that this asymmetry is lost in J20 AD model mice due to a selective reduction of mGlu5 in the left hippocampus. Then, using the light-controllable negative allosteric modulator Alloswitch-1, we demonstrate that selective inhibition of mGlu5 in the left, but not right, hippocampus is both necessary and sufficient to restore working and short-term memory in J20 mice. This left-specific modulation also reverses downstream pathological signaling, including aberrant Pyk2 and GSK3-{beta} activation and tau hyperphosphorylation, in both hippocampi. Our findings identify a functional lateralization of mGlu5 in hippocampal circuits and highlight the potential of spatially targeted photopharmacology for precise intervention in early AD pathology.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
