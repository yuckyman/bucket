      "title": "Seasonal blood-brain barrier plasticity links environmental cues to migratory behavior in monarch butterflies",
      "content": "Seasonal migration requires animals to reversibly switch behavioral states in response to environmental cues, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these transitions remain poorly understood. Monarch butterflies provide a powerful model, as Eastern North American populations undergo a long-distance southward migration in the fall followed by a cold-dependent reversal in flight orientation after overwintering each spring. Here, we show that cold exposure induces coordinated transcriptional changes in the monarch brain, marked by attenuated integrin-mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling at the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Cold-exposed monarchs exhibit increased penetration of fluorescent markers into the brain, consistent with increased BBB permeability. Notably, our findings align with previous genomic evidence identifying collagen type IV alpha 1, a major ECM component, as a locus under divergent selection between migratory and non-migratory populations. Together, these results implicate seasonal modulation of BBB permeability as a mechanism linking environmental temperature to plastic migratory behavior and identify the BBB as a dynamic interface through which seasonal cues may reprogram neural function and behavior.",

      "title": "Distinct subcortical pathways mediate collision detection with and without attention and consciousness",
      "content": "Accurate detection of impending collisions is essential for survival. While multiple subcortical pathways have been found in the detection of looming stimuli, the roles of top-down attention and consciousness in this process remains unclear. Using high-resolution fMRI, we investigated how top-down attention and conscious awareness influence the subcortical processing of collision trajectories in healthy participants and hemianopic patients with cortical blindness. In healthy participants, the superior colliculus (SC)-parabigeminal nucleus (PBGN)-amygdala pathway integrated binocular information for accurate detection of collision trajectories in the upper visual field, but only when participants were paying attention to the looming stimuli. On the other hand, for stimuli presented in the blind visual field of hemianopic patients, effective connectivity analyses revealed collision sensitivity in the SC-pulvinar and SC-ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways, supporting automatic collision detection even in the absence of visual awareness. Together, these findings suggest that distinct subcortical pathways mediate collision detection in the human brain depending on the presence and absence of attention and conscious awareness.",

      "title": "Progranulin deficiency induces lipid droplet accumulation in microglia via a STAT3-GPAT3 axis",
      "content": "Heterozygous mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) encoding gene GRN cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD), whereas homozygous GRN mutations lead to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL). However, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration due to PGRN deficiency remain unclear. In the aged brains or under neurodegenerative conditions, the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) in microglia contributes to cellular dysfunction and pro-inflammatory responses, exacerbating neurodegenerative pathology. Here, we investigated how PGRN deficiency induces LD accumulation in microglia. We found that PGRN ablation significantly upregulated triglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase 3 (GPAT3), the first and rate-limiting enzyme for triacylglycerol biosynthesis, and increased LD formation in both Grn-/- BV2 microglial cells and Grn-/- mouse brains. Mechanistic study revealed that PGRN deficiency upregulates GPAT3 via stimulating signal transduction and activator of transcription factor 3 (STAT3) signaling. Silencing Gpat3, inhibiting GPAT3 activity with the small molecule inhibitor FSG67, or PGRN restoration reduced LD accumulation and rescued the cytotoxicity of Grn-/- microglia conditional medium (MCM) toward N2a cells. Notably, intraperitoneal administration of FSG67 or AAV-MG1.2-mCx3cr1-mGrn-eGFP-mediated microglia-specific gene therapy reduced microglial LDs and ameliorated behavior phenotypes in Grn-/- mice. Our study elucidates the role of PGRN loss in microglial lipid homeostasis and identifies the STAT3-GPAT3 axis as a potential therapeutic target for LD-associated neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Effects of violence on executive function: a neuropsychological and predictive analysis in victims of the armed conflict in Colombia",
      "content": "IntroductionExposure to violence has been associated with alterations in how the brain organizes thought, regulates emotions, and guides behavior. In Colombia, decades of armed conflict have generated heterogeneous patterns of cognitive vulnerability, yet evidence on executive and emotional functioning in adult victims remains limited.MethodsThis cross-sectional study compared executive and emotional functioning between victims and non-victims of the Colombian armed conflict. A total of 300 middle-aged adults from the Department of Bol\u00edvar were assessed using a neuropsychological battery (MMSE, Tower of Hanoi, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, and Frontal Assessment Battery) and emotional screening instruments (GAD-7 and PHQ-2). Executive function was modeled as a latent construct using confirmatory factor analysis and Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models adjusted for sociodemographic covariates. Random Forest was implemented as a complementary, assumption-free analytic strategy.ResultsVictims showed significantly poorer performance in planning, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control (\u03b2 = \u20130.178; p = 0.024). Educational attainment emerged as the strongest predictor of executive functioning (\u03b2 = \u20130.249; p < 0.001). The factorial model showed modest fit (CFI = 0.76), reflecting ecological and educational heterogeneity. Machine learning analyses converged with latent-variable results, identifying exposure to violence and structural inequalities as the strongest predictors of executive variability, whereas emotional factors played a marginal role.DiscussionThe findings delineate a cognitive profile associated with conflict-related victimization, characterized by vulnerabilities in executive control processes. These results underscore the need for clinical and public policy interventions that integrate neuroscientific approaches to strengthen planning and decision-making capacities in populations affected by armed conflict.",

      "title": "The influence of class mobility on pain empathy among the wealthy in collectivist cultures: evidence from ERPs",
      "content": "IntroductionAs a privileged group within the social structure, the wealthy play a significant role in social philanthropy and public welfare initiatives, making their empathic capacity a subject of considerable interest. Previous research has found that wealthy individuals who have experienced upward class mobility paradoxically demonstrate reduced empathy toward the poor. However, these studies were predominantly conducted in individualistic cultural contexts, leaving the collectivist cultural perspective largely unexplored.MethodsThe present study employed a virtual-society paradigm to experimentally simulate class mobility in a collectivist context. Objective mobility direction (upward vs. horizontal) and subjective evaluation of mobility (positive vs. negative) were manipulated to construct four types of wealthy roles (upward-positive, upward-negative, horizontal-positive, horizontal-negative). Chinese university students from a collectivist cultural background were instructed to sequentially adopt each wealthy role and judge painful versus neutral pictures of the same low-status target, while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded.ResultsThe results revealed that in the early N2 component, under upward mobility conditions, pain stimuli elicited significantly smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli, while no significant difference was observed under horizontal mobility conditions. In positive evaluation conditions, pain stimuli evoked significantly smaller N2 amplitudes than neutral stimuli, whereas no significant difference emerged in negative evaluation conditions. For the late LPP component, pain stimuli consistently elicited significantly larger LPP amplitudes than neutral stimuli, regardless of either the objective direction of class mobility or subjective evaluation.DiscussionThese findings suggest that, within this simulated class-mobility context, upward mobility experiences and positive appraisal primarily influence early neural processing of the poor target\u2019s pain, while later evaluative processing remains relatively stable. This study provides neural-level evidence for understanding how class mobility affects pain empathy among the wealthy in collectivist cultures, thereby enriching research on the relationship between social stratification and pain empathy.",

      "title": "Neuromotor adaptations in people with Parkinson's Disease following a 12-month multimodal non-contact boxing intervention",
      "content": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a common neurological disorder that diminishes neuromotor control. Exercise training provides a nonpharmacological treatment option that may help motor symptom severity and trajectory. In the present case series, we assessed linear and non-linear measures of neuromotor control along with functional measures of mobility in six men living with PD across a year of multimodal exercise training. Our measurements encompassed mobility, balance, strength, and force control metrics and were captured at baseline as well as at defined intervals following exercise engagement. The results appear to indicate a favorable preservation of functional ability and neuromotor control for most of the cohort across the yearlong exercise intervention. Our linear measures of neuromotor control generally remained stable with slight improvements from baseline to month 12, with visually distinct trends for our non-linear measures (Sample Entropy) of neuromotor control suggestive of more adaptive motor control strategies for both postural and force control. These data corroborate reports showing favorable outcomes for people with Parkinson's Disease following exercise engagement. Our year-long assessment of neuromotor control in a cohort of men with Parkinson's disease provides a novel contribution to the trajectory of change in this population while undergoing multimodal exercise training.",

      "content": "Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant leukodystrophy primarily caused by mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene, characterized by progressive cognitive and motor decline. We present a case of a 42-year-old Chinese woman with a rapidly progressive syndrome featuring prominent apathy, cognitive impairment, and hypoactivity. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive confluent white matter hyperintensities (Fazekas grade 3) predominantly in frontal and parietal lobes, cerebral atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum. Comprehensive genetic testing identified a heterozygous missense mutation in the CSF1R gene (c.2342C\u202f>\u202fT, p.Ala781Val), located within the tyrosine kinase domain, confirming the Diagnosis of HDLS. This case highlights early apathy and hypoactivity as red-flag manifestations of CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy in a 42-year-old woman with rapidly progressive cognitive decline. The atypical presentation, initially mimicking psychiatric or demyelinating disease, underscores the need to consider CSF1R sequencing when encountering early-onset cognitive or behavioral deterioration with unexplained white-matter changes, thereby facilitating timely diagnosis and genetic counseling.",

      "content": "BackgroundAnorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder frequently marked by poor treatment response and chronic progression toward rigid, restrictive behaviors. These features highlight the need for innovative strategies targeting core mechanisms and symptoms of the disorder. This feasibility trial evaluates individualized intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual, with the goal of identifying patient-specific targets and paving the way for personalized neuromodulation in AN.MethodsThirty-four adults with AN (\u226518 years, illness \u226512 months, \u22651 prior unsuccessful treatment) will be randomized (1:1) to 20 sessions of real or sham iTBS over 4 weeks. Stimulation will be delivered with a MagPro system and a Cool B70 A/P active/sham coil; motor threshold will be estimated with the Stochastic Approximator (SAMT) and re-checked weekly. Individualized stimulation target will be defined based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to identify the cortical region within the PPC that is maximally functionally connected with the activity of two meta-analytically derived networks representing body representation and implicit behavioral tendencies. Coil placement will be neuronavigated on individual T1 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Assessments will take place at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and 4-month follow-up (T2), covering clinical status (body mass index (BMI), psychopathology, and quality of life), experimental tasks (implicit body representation, peripersonal space, approach\u2013avoidance tendencies toward food, interoceptive accuracy, and neurocognitive functioning), and MRI. Feasibility endpoints include recruitment, retention, completion, blinding, and tolerability. Ethics approval: 6168/EST/25; registration: NCT07106645.DiscussionThis trial emphasizes individualized PPC targeting and rigorous motor threshold (MT) estimation to advance personalized neuromodulation in AN. Feasibility and effect-size data will guide a confirmatory randomized clinical trial, while mechanistic analyses will test whether targeted iTBS strengthens body-schema circuits and aligns neural changes with clinical improvement, supporting a precision-psychiatry approach to eating disorders.Trail registrationhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07106645, identifier NCT07106645.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11533v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Clinical psychology students frequently report feeling underprepared for the interpersonal demands of therapeutic work, highlighting the need for accessible opportunities to practise core counselling skills before seeing real clients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) now enable simulated interaction partners that may support early skills development. This study examined postgraduate clinical psychology students' perceptions of two AI-based simulations: a text-based chatbot (ChatGPT) and a voice-based avatar (HeyGen). Twenty-four students completed two brief cognitive-behavioural role-plays (counterbalanced), one with each tool, and provided both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on perceived usefulness, skill application, responsiveness and engagement, and perceived skill improvement. Both AI tools were evaluated positively across dimensions. However, the avatar was rated significantly higher than the chatbot for perceived usefulness, skill application, and perceived skill improvement, and qualitative comments highlighted the added value of voice-based interaction for conveying social and emotional cues. These findings suggest that AI-driven simulation may supplement early-stage clinical skills training, with voice-based avatars offering additional benefits. Future work should test whether such simulated interactions translate to objective improvements in real therapeutic performance.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11531v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Manual creation of IT monitoring dashboard widgets is slow, error-prone, and a barrier for both novice and expert users. We present NOVAID, an interactive chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate IT monitoring widgets directly from natural language queries. Unlike general natural language-to-visualization tools, NOVAID addresses IT operations-specific challenges: specialized widget types like SLO charts, dynamic API-driven data retrieval, and complex contextual filters. The system combines a domain-aware semantic parser, fuzzy entity matching, and schema completion to produce standardized widget JSON specifications. An interactive clarification loop ensures accuracy in underspecified queries. On a curated dataset of 271 realistic queries, NOVAID achieves promising accuracy (up to 94.10% in metric extraction) across multiple LLMs. A user study with IT engineers yielded a System Usability Scale score of 74.2 for NOVAID, indicating good usability. By bridging natural language intent with operational dashboards, NOVAID demonstrates clear potential and a path for deployment in enterprise ITOps monitoring platforms.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11530v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Young adults today face unprecedented mental health challenges, yet many hesitate to seek support due to barriers such as accessibility, stigma, and time constraints. Bite-sized well-being interventions offer a promising solution to preventing mental distress before it escalates to clinical levels, but have not yet been delivered through personalized, interactive, and scalable technology. We conducted the first multi-institutional, longitudinal, preregistered randomized controlled trial of a generative AI-powered mobile app (\"Flourish\") designed to address this gap. Over six weeks in Fall 2024, 486 undergraduate students from three U.S. institutions were randomized to receive app access or waitlist control. Participants in the treatment condition reported significantly greater positive affect, resilience, and social well-being (i.e., increased belonging, closeness to community, and reduced loneliness) and were buffered against declines in mindfulness and flourishing. These findings suggest that, with purposeful and ethical design, generative AI can deliver proactive, population-level well-being interventions that produce measurable benefits.",

However, LLM-based conversational agents suffer from spatiotemporal distortions when responding to variant user inputs, failing to maintain consistency with provided scenarios. We propose SNAP (Story and Narrative-based Agent with Planning), a framework that structures narratives into Cells with explicit Plans to prevent narrative drift in web environments. By confining context within each Cell and employing detailed plans that specify spatiotemporal settings, character actions, and plot developments, SNAP enables coherent and scenario-consistent dialogues while adapting to diverse user responses. Via automated and human evaluations, we validate SNAP's superiority in narrative controllability, demonstrating effective scenario consistency despite variant user inputs in web-based interactive storytelling.",

This study investigated how people evaluate advice on LLM-generated romantic relationships. Participants rated advice satisfaction, model reliability, and helpfulness, and completed pre- and post-measures of their general attitudes toward LLMs. Overall, the results showed participants' high satisfaction with LLM-generated advice. Greater satisfaction was, in turn, strongly and positively associated with their perceptions of the models' reliability and helpfulness. Importantly, participants' attitudes toward LLMs improved significantly after exposure to the advice, suggesting that supportive and contextually relevant advice can enhance users' trust and openness toward these AI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.11526v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: LLMs are increasingly being deployed as chatbots, but today's interfaces offer little to no friction: users interact through seamless conversations that conceal when the model is drifting, hallucinating or failing. This lack of transparency fosters blind trust, even as models produce unstable or repetitive outputs. We introduce an interactive demo that surfaces and mitigates cognitive fatigue, a failure mode where LLMs gradually lose coherence during auto-regressive generation. Our system, Chatsparent, instruments real-time, token-level signals of fatigue, including attention-to-prompt decay, embedding drift, and entropy collapse, and visualizes them as a unified fatigue index. When fatigue thresholds are crossed, the interface allows users to activate lightweight interventions such as attention resets, entropy-regularized decoding, and self-reflection checkpoints. The demo streams live text and fatigue signals, allowing users to observe when fatigue arises, how it affects output quality, and how interventions restore stability. By turning passive chatbot interaction into an interactive diagnostic experience, our system empowers users to better understand LLM behavior while improving reliability at inference time.",
