      "title": "Activity-dependent control of axonal amphisome trafficking governs norepinephrine release in vivo",
      "content": "The postmitotic nature, exceptional longevity, and elaborate cytoarchitecture of neurons exert extraordinary demands on proteostasis and autophagy regulation. Amphisomes are organelles of the autophagy pathway that result from the fusion of autophagosomes with late endosomes. Previous work suggests that neuronal amphisomes also serve as signalling platforms, though their physiological relevance in vivo remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate dynamic trafficking of amphisomes within the long-range, highly branched axons of locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) neurons. Using in vivo photoconversion, we show that amphisomes originating in distal axons can traverse the entire axonal length to reach the soma. Two-photon imaging of LC-NE projections to the prefrontal cortex revealed that velocity and directionality of trafficking are tightly regulated by LC activity states, behavioural context, and autocrine norepinephrine signalling. Activation of Gi-coupled receptor signalling unifies directionality of transport, enhances somatic cargo delivery, whereas prolonged distal immobilization correlates with increased norepinephrine release, consistent with a signalling function. Together, these findings establish LC amphisomes as dual-function organelles that integrate degradative transport with activity-dependent signalling in vivo.",

      "title": "Quantifying Rhythmic and Arrhythmic Components of Brain Activity",
      "content": "Brain activity comprises both rhythmic (periodic) and arrhythmic (aperiodic) components. These signal elements vary across healthy aging, and disease, and may make distinct contributions to conscious perception. Despite pioneering techniques to parameterize rhythmic and arrhythmic neural components based on power spectra, the methodology for quantifying rhythmic activity remains in its infancy. Variation in analytical choices for isolating brain rhythms from background arrhythmic activity makes interpreting findings across studies difficult. Whether current approaches can accurately recover the independent contribution of these neural signal elements remains to be established. Here, using simulation and parameter recovery approaches, we show that standard analytic methods for quantifying rhythmic activity conflate these two neurophysiological components, yielding spurious correlations between spectral model parameters. We propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations and demonstrate effective separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic components in simulated neural time series. We validate these methods using resting-state recordings from a large cohort. Our recommendations for spectral parameterization enable the robust independent quantification of rhythmic and arrhythmic signal components for cognitive neuroscience.",

      "content": "The developmental identity and fate of NG2-glia remain debated: are they transient oligodendrocyte precursors or a distinct, self-renewing glial population? Here, we examined how the temporal origin of progenitors influences NG2-glia and oligodendrocyte lineages in the dorsal cortex. Using in utero and postnatal StarTrack electroporation at E12, E14, E16, and P0, we traced their progeny to P30 and P90, performing a clonal analysis in adult mouse brains. Progenitors labeled at E16 generated significantly larger and more widely dispersed NG2-glia clones, whose contribution increased from P30 to P90, suggesting enhanced proliferative capacity. In contrast, P0-derived progenitors showed reduced NG2-glia maintenance and a strong bias toward oligodendrocyte differentiation, forming larger OL clones. Clonal heterogeneity, including mixed NG2-glia/OL clones, was observed across all stages but peaked at E16. These results identify E16 as a critical window for NG2-glia expansion and self-renewal, while P0 marks a transition toward oligodendrocyte lineage restriction, establishing a developmental framework for adult NG2-glia heterogeneity and maybe a regenerative potential.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "Maximizing theoretical and practical storage capacity in single-layer feedforward neural networks",
      "content": "Artificial neural networks are limited in the number of patterns that they can store and accurately recall, with capacity constraints arising from factors such as network size, architectural structure, pattern sparsity, and pattern dissimilarity. Exceeding these limits leads to recall errors, eventually leading to catastrophic forgetting, which is a major challenge in continual learning. In this study, we characterize the theoretical maximum memory capacity of single-layer feedforward networks as a function of these parameters. We derive analytical expressions for maximum theoretical memory capacity and introduce a grid-based construction and sub-sampling method for pattern generation that takes advantage of the full storage potential of the network. Our findings indicate that maximum capacity scales as (N/S)S, where N is the number of input/output units and S the pattern sparsity, under threshold constraints related to minimum pattern differentiability. Simulation results validate these theoretical predictions and show that the optimal pattern set can be constructed deterministically for any given network size and pattern sparsity, systematically outperforming random pattern generation in terms of storage capacity. This work offers a foundational framework for maximizing storage efficiency in neural network systems and supports the development of data-efficient, sustainable AI.",
