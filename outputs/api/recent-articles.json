      "title": "Quantifying the Role of Duodenal Shape in Flow and Mixing: A Computational Fluid Dynamics Study on Anatomically Diverse Models",
      "content": "Objective: Enzymatic digestion of food and absorption of nutrients in the duodenum are affected by flow and mixing driven by peristaltic contractions. Our understanding of how the duodenum shape varies among individuals and how these anatomical differences affect the transport dynamics is limited. Methods: A landmark-free approach was used to perform statistical shape analysis of the duodenum, then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with anatomically realistic peristaltic contractions were used to characterize the effect of anatomical variations on flow and mixing. Leveraging the inherent tubular \u2018C\u2019 shape of the duodenum, centerlines and cross-sectional areas were computed for CT data from 34 subjects. The average radius and duodenal orientation in the form of the components of the tangent vectors to the centerline at 60 equally spaced (normalised by the centerline length) locations were used as inputs to a principal component analysis (PCA). Results: CFD simulations revealed similar flow features across all geometries including the location of stagnation points and the presence of reversed flow, and swirling patterns. The most extreme geometry, experiencing the largest magnitude of radial contractions, achieved a mixing state approximately twice that of the mean geometry within a 60 s period. Conclusion: This work provides new insights into duodenal shape variation and its impacts on intestinal fluid dynamics. Significance: The methods and datasets developed here have broader implications for understanding gastrointestinal function, digestion, and drug delivery by establishing quantitative links between anatomical variation and digestive processes.",

      "title": "EEG-based meditation decoding: tackling subject variability with spatial and temporal alignment",
      "content": "Objective. Meditation and mindfulness are increasingly recognized as important in improving mental well-being. However, electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback systems supporting these practices typically fail to generalize to unseen subjects. This study investigates the application of both spatial and spectral alignment to EEG to improve the classification of meditation and rest states for new subjects without any model retraining. Approach. Two unsupervised domain adaptation techniques are employed to reduce differences between subjects in their EEG recordings. The first, Riemannian Space Data Alignment (RSDA), adjusts and brings together patterns of brain activity across electrodes (spatial domain). The second, Convolutional Monge Mapping Normalization (CMMN), aligns the distribution of brain rhythms across frequencies (spectral domain). Each method is evaluated separately, in combination, and in interaction with z-score normalization. Classification between meditation and rest is performed on the aligned time series using EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network architecture, with leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation to assess generalization across subjects. All experiments are based on a publicly available dataset of meditation EEG recordings from 53 subjects, including both novice and expert meditators. Main results. The combined RSDA+CMMN approach significantly improved LOSO classification accuracy (66.6%) compared to non-aligned (55.7%) and z-score normalized (59.6%) baselines, even though it did not improve overall harmonization. Spectral analysis identified consistent classification contributions from the Theta (4\u20138\u2009Hz), Alpha (8\u201314\u2009Hz), and Beta (14\u201330\u2009Hz) bands, while spatial analysis highlighted Frontopolar and Temporal regions as critical for distinguishing the mental states of meditation and rest. Significance. This work is the first to explore both spatial and spectral alignment in subject-independent meditation decoding for improved cross-subject generalization. Aligning EEG time series without retraining provides a practical solution for real-time neurofeedback, thereby reducing subject variability and paving the way toward calibration-free neurotechnology that supports mental well-being.",

      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",
