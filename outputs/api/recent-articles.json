      "title": "Mapping the Cerebello-Hippocampal Circuit: Normative Patterns and Sex-Dependent Connectivity",
      "content": "Cerebello hippocampal (CBHP) interactions have been implicated in spatial abilities and reinforcement learning, yet their relationship to behavior and differences in connectivity with sex in early adulthood are unclear. Resting CBHP network patterns have yet to be established in young adults. Mapping the normative resting-state CBHP connectivity pattern is essential for identifying when CBHP circuitry becomes behaviorally relevant across the lifespan and for detecting early circuit-level deviations that may precede neurodegenerative or endocrine disruption. We combined resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with measures of cognition in 1,081 healthy young adults (22 to 37 years, 54% women) from the Human Connectome Project S1200 to map CBHP functional connectivity (FC), examine sex differences, and define its relationship with performance across episodic memory, visuospatial, and executive function tasks. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI FC between the right cerebellum and left hippocampus were quantified. In our CB-HP mapping, we found: 1) negative relationships between the entire HP axis and cerebellar regions: vermis VII; lobules VI, VIIb, and VIII; Crus I & II, and 2) positive relationships between most of the HP axis and ventral/medial cerebellar regions. We revealed sex differences in CB-HP such that females had greater FC than males between anterior to mid-hippocampal regions and medial cerebellar regions: vermis IV-VI; lobules VI, VIII, IX; and Crus II. We predicted CBHP FC patterns would show strong positive associations with cognitive measures (i.e., episodic memory, visuospatial processing, working memory, and executive function); however, we did not find any associations after multiple comparisons correction (pFDR > 0.05). Together, our findings detail a functional atlas of the CBHP circuit in young adulthood and highlight sex differences within. Our results provide a foundation for understanding functionally based gradients between these two regions.",

      "title": "PI-FC: Pre-training Individual-specific Functional Connectome through State-invariant Contrastive Learning",
      "content": "Functional MRI enables non-invasive mapping of brain connectivity, yet its clinical translation remains hindered by uncontrolled state-dependent variability that obscures individual-specific signatures during routine scanning. Here we introduce PI-FC - a deep learning framework leveraging state-invariant contrastive learning to extract stable individual brain signatures across diverse arousal levels, cognitive states, and temporal scales spanning tens of seconds to hours. PI-FC achieves equivalent phenotypic prediction accuracy using substantially reduced scanning time, and eliminates state-dependent effects varying task demands and brain states. Trained on 36,119 subjects across 8 independent datasets, our model demonstrates superior cross-site generalization and outperforms traditional functional connectome (FC) in predicting neuropsychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, autism, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, PI-FC enables zero-shot inference of brain age, biological sex, and cognitive ability without site-specific retraining. Overall, PI-FC represents a robust, clinically scalable framework that overcomes fundamental barriers to real-world deployment of precision functional neuroimaging.",

      "title": "PEDF peptides rescue defects in neurite morphogenesis and intracellular calcium response in cortical neurons from mice exposed to valproic acid",
      "content": "Pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein produced predominantly by the retinal pigment epithelium and expressed in many tissues, including the brain, highlighting its participation in crucial processes, such as neuroprotection and angiogenesis. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD, are characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including altered neurite formation, spine formation, and neuronal activities. Many efforts have been made to resolve NDDs, but until now, some symptoms remain untargeted. PEDF is involved in many steps of neurodevelopment. The treatment of PEDF peptide might improve the outcome of NDD symptoms by altering neuronal morphologies. We used PEDF peptides that contain different functional domains to study the effect of administering PEDF peptides on neuronal morphology in a prenatal valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mouse model. We identified that the treatment with PEDF peptides rectified the abnormalities in neurite formation and spine formation in VPA-exposed cortical neurons. In vitro calcium imaging showed abnormalities in the spontaneous activity in VPA-exposed cortical neurons. Treatment of a short PEDF peptide normalized intracellular calcium response to the control level. Accordingly, PEDF peptides have the prospect of serving as potential treatments for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD.",

      "title": "PELICAN: a Longitudinal Image Processing Pipeline for Analyzing Structural Magnetic Resonance Images in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Populations",
      "content": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for accurate non-invasive assessment of the brain's structure and its longitudinal changes. Availability of large scale longitudinal MRI datasets enables us to probe brain changes in health and disease, and derive longitudinal trajectories of brain morphometry based measures to estimate brain atrophy and other disease-related abnormalities. In contrast to their cross-sectional counterparts, image processing pipelines that have been designed for longitudinal data can reduce noise in the derived measurements by disentangling the within and between subject variabilities, improving the sensitivity of the downstream models in detecting more subtle longitudinal changes. Here we present PELICAN, our open source multi-contrast longitudinal image processing pipeline, that has been designed and extensively validated for use in longitudinal settings and populations with neurodegenerative disorders. PELICAN can use population specific average templates as intermediate targets to derive accurate nonlinear registrations for cases with substantial levels of atrophy, which commonly used pipelines struggle to process. We evaluated PELICAN's performance across over 34,000 MRIs from multiple aging and neurodegenerative disorder cohorts, and compared its reliability and failure rates against FreeSurfer as a widely used image processing tool, showing superior performance of PELICAN compared to FreeSurfer, both in terms of failure rate and reliability. Our results demonstrate that PELICAN can be used to accurately process MRIs of individuals with neurodegenerative disease who present with greater levels of atrophy and white matter lesion burden.",

      "title": "Learning Residual-based Biomarkers of Cognitive Health via Self-Supervised Learning on EEG State Transitions",
      "content": "Deep learning (DL) models have achieved impressive performance in EEG-based prediction tasks, but they often lack interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this study, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework inspired by neurophysiological reactivity. Our approach models healthy EEG transitions between ocular states by predicting an EEG-derived feature under eyes-open conditions, using features from eyes-closed recordings. The residual between observed and predicted values quantifies deviations from normative brain dynamics and serves as a candidate biomarker. To improve clinical relevance, we propose two optimisation strategies that promote residuals predictive of pathology. We evaluated the framework using healthy cohorts (LEMON, Dortmund Vital) for self-supervised training, and the AI-Mind cohort for downstream prediction of plasma p-tau217 levels, a proxy for cognitive pathology. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimisation, predictive performance remained poor across all methods, including baseline models, suggesting limitations in the downstream proxy or input signal. Nonetheless, our approach provides a transparent methodology for transition-based EEG biomarker discovery grounded in self-supervised learning.",

      "title": "Domain-specific functions of LRIT3 in synaptic assembly and retinal signal transmission",
      "content": "LRIT3 is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein that is expressed in the retina, and its absence causes complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB), a genetically diverse disorder characterized by impaired low-light vision, myopia, and nystagmus. LRIT3 is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors, and it trans-synaptically organizes the assembly of the glutamate signaling complex, the signalplex, on depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). LRIT3 is a single-pass membrane protein with extracellular LRR, IG, and FN3 domains. The mechanism by which LRIT3 controls postsynaptic receptor organization remains unknown. We address this by using rAAV to express deletion constructs in LRIT3 knockout retinas and examining LRIT3 trafficking, as well as the structural and functional recovery of the signalplex in DBCs. We show the LRR domain is required for trafficking LRIT3 to the synapse in cones, but not rod photoreceptors, although it is needed for reassembly and function of the rod BC signalplex. Neither the IG nor the FN3 domain is needed for synaptic localization of LRIT3. However, the IG domain is required for the localization of TRPM1 to the signalplex and thus function. The FN3 domain is not necessary for either DBC signalplex assembly or function. Our data demonstrates that the LRR and IG domains of LRIT3 are crucial for TRPM1 localization and retinal function, with the LRR domain playing a key role in the differential function of LRIT3 at rod and cone synapses. Notably, our results show that restoring Nyctalopin localization to the DBC signalplex alone is insufficient to restore TRPM1 expression. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which the LRR domain trans-synaptically binds with Nyctalopin, while the IG domain interacts with TRPM1.",

      "title": "Dream content and slow waves benefit preys against predators in a video game confrontation",
      "content": "Every studied animal species exhibits some form of sleep, a state evolved under the sustained influence of prey and predator behaviors. Dreams have been proposed to have evolved as offline mental simulations able to warn against impending threats from the environment, such as predators. To assess how the roles of prey and predator interact with sleep and dreaming, we used a first-person shooter game as a proxy for predator-prey confrontations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were recorded from 30 human adults paired and simultaneously recorded while 1) playing a video game round against each other, in which one participant was armed with a gun and the other was not, 2) taking a nap, 3) reporting dreams and/or thoughts, and 4) playing another round with the same gun assignment. We found that the participants in the prey role were highly affected by sleep and dreaming. Their score gains were positively correlated with slow wave activity during the nap, with how much the dreams were related to the game, and with heart rate variability during the first round. In contrast, no significant correlations were found for participants in the predator role. The results suggest that slow wave activity and game-related dream content during sleep improve the post-sleep performance of individuals under stressful, prey-like situations.",

      "title": "Unifying spatial and episodic representations in the hippocampus through flexible memory use",
      "content": "A key question in neuroscience is why the hippocampus is essential for episodic memory in humans, while dominantly exhibiting spatial representations in a number of other species. Some accounts suggest that spatial representation is the primary hippocampal function. Here, we propose that the primary function is storing and retrieving episodic memories, and spatial representations emerge due to this memory function. To demonstrate this, we adopt a computational model that autonomously learns to store information in memory and retrieve it to solve a variety of tasks. In memory tasks, the model develops associations and categorical representations akin to concept cells. In navigation tasks, the model forms representations of the spatial structure, performs geometric computations, and even learns representations of unique events similar to recently discovered barcodes. Our model predicts that the hippocampus represents any task-relevant variable, if the animal learns the task, suggesting that space is not special for the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Chronic delivery of buprenorphine during abstinence decreases incubation of heroin seeking and neuronal activation in medial prefrontal cortex and striatum in male and female rats",
      "content": "Rationale and Objective: Buprenorphine is an FDA-approved medication for opioid addiction, but the brain regions underlying its therapeutic effects remain unknown. We previously found that chronic buprenorphine treatment decreases several relapse-related behaviors in rats. Here, we tested whether chronic buprenorphine decreases the time-dependent increase (incubation) in heroin seeking during abstinence. We also used the activity marker Fos to test whether buprenorphine inhibition of incubation of heroin seeking is associated with decreased activation of cortical and striatal regions. Methods: We trained Oprm1-Cre rats and their wild-type littermates to self-administer heroin for 12 days (6 h/day). On abstinence Day 1, we tested for heroin seeking under extinction conditions. On Day 14, we implanted osmotic minipumps containing saline or buprenorphine (6 mg/kg/day). On abstinence Days 21-22, we tested the rats (or not tested, baseline condition) for incubation of heroin seeking, after which brains were collected for Fos immunohistochemistry. Results: Oprm1-Cre rats did not differ from wild-type littermates in heroin self-administration or non-incubated heroin seeking on abstinence Day 1. In both genotypes, chronic buprenorphine decreased incubated heroin seeking on Days 21-22. Buprenorphine also decreased incubation-related neuronal activation in several cortical areas (anterior cingulate and dorsal peduncular, but not prelimbic, infralimbic, or orbitofrontal cortex) and striatal areas (dorsolateral and dorsomedial striosomes and nucleus accumbens core, but not shell). Conclusions: Chronic buprenorphine decreased incubation of heroin seeking, supporting the predictive validity of the rat model. This effect was associated with decreased neuronal activity in specific subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum.",

      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",
