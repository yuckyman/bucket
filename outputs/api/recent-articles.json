However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Amputation of a lower limb not only affects mobility but also interferes with sensory feedback, leading to an elevated risk of falls among individuals living with amputation. Sensory substitution, achieved through tactile displays embedded in transfemoral prosthetic sockets, presents a promising non-invasive solution to provide artificial sensation to users. However, for this approach to be effective, users must accurately perceive distinct combinations of vibrations, a capacity limited by their...",

In a proof-of-concept driving simulator study, we evaluated a hazard warning device designed for vision impaired drivers. Three groups participated: 11 persons with central vision loss (CVL; median age 60 years), 12 with homonymous field loss (HFL; 52 years) and 11 with normal vision (NV; 60 years). CVL is characterized by impaired visual acuity and contrast sensitivity while HFL is a loss of vision in the same half of the visual...",

According to Braak's classic model, the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) only affects somatosensory cortices in advanced disease stages; however, the processing of complex sensory stimuli, such as CT-mediated Affective Touch, may be impacted in earlier phases.ObjectiveThe present study aimed to assess the...",
