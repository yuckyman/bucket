      "content": "arXiv:2511.02233v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Laparoscopic surgery constrains surgeons spatial awareness because procedures are performed through a monocular, two-dimensional (2D) endoscopic view. Conventional training methods using dry-lab models or recorded videos provide limited depth cues, often leading trainees to misjudge instrument position and perform ineffective or unsafe maneuvers. To address this limitation, we present an AI-assisted training framework developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim that couples the standard 2D laparoscopic feed with synchronized three-dimensional (3D) visual feedback delivered through a mixed-reality (MR) interface. While trainees operate using the clinical 2D view, validated AI modules continuously localize surgical instruments and detect instrument-tissue interactions in the background. When spatial misjudgments are detected, 3D visual feedback are displayed to trainees, while preserving the original operative perspective. Our framework considers various surgical tasks including navigation, manipulation, transfer, cutting, and suturing. Visually similar 2D cases can be disambiguated through the added 3D context, improving depth perception, contact awareness, and tool orientation understanding.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02079v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When several individuals collaborate on a shared task, their brain activities often synchronize. This phenomenon, known as Inter-brain Synchronization (IBS), is notable for inducing prosocial outcomes such as enhanced interpersonal feelings, including closeness, trust, empathy, and more. Further strengthening the IBS with the aid of external feedback would be beneficial for scenarios where those prosocial feelings play a vital role in interpersonal communication, such as rehabilitation between a therapist and a patient, motor skill learning between a teacher and a student, and group performance art. This paper investigates whether visual, auditory, and haptic feedback of the IBS level can further enhance its intensity, offering design recommendations for feedback systems in IBS. We report findings when three different types of feedback were provided: IBS level feedback by means of on-body projection mapping, sonification using chords, and vibration bands attached to the wrist.",

The neuronal operational modes that arise with fixed inputs but with varying degrees of stimulation help to elucidate their coding properties. In neurons receiving {\\it in vivo} stimulation, we show that two operation modes can be described with simplified models: the coincidence detection mode and the integration mode. Our derivations include a simplified polynomial model with non-linear coefficients ($\\beta_i$) that capture the subthreshold dynamics of these modes of operation. The resulting model can explain these transitions with the sign and size of the smallest nonlinear coefficient of the polynomial alone. Defining neuronal operational modes provides insight into the processing and transmission of information through electrical currents. Requisite operational modes for proper neuronal functioning may explain disorders involving dysfunction of electrophysiological behavior, such as channelopathies.",

      "content": "arXiv:2404.03902v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Past work has reported inverted-U relationships between arousal and auditory task performance, but the underlying neural network mechanisms remain unclear. To make progress, we recorded auditory cortex activity from behaving mice during passive tone presentation and simultaneously monitored pupil-indexed arousal. In these experiments, neural discriminability of tones was maximized at intermediate arousal, revealing a neural correlate of the inverted-U. We explained this arousal-dependent sound processing using a spiking model with clusters. In the model, stimulus discriminability peaked as the network transitioned from a multi-attractor phase exhibiting slow switching between metastable cluster activations (low arousal) to a single-attractor phase with uniform activity (high arousal). This transition also qualitatively captured arousal-induced reductions of neural variability observed in the data. Altogether, this study elucidates computational principles to explain interactions between arousal, neural discriminability, and variability, and suggests that transitions in the dynamical regime of cortical networks could underlie nonlinear modulations of sensory processing.",

Most existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02241v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.01885v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities, aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing top-down controls.\n  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks: (1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?\n  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge, evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and propose a theoretical framework for further study.\n  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02766v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The gut microbiota has emerged as a fundamental regulator of sleep physiology, influencing neural, endocrine, and immune pathways through the gut-microbiota-brain axis (GMBA). This bidirectional communication system modulates neurotransmitter production, circadian rhythms, and metabolic homeostasis, while disruptions in microbial composition have been linked to sleep disorders, neuroinflammation, and systemic immune dysfunction. Recent findings suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sleep disturbances by altering serotonin, GABA, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, with implications for neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic syndromes, and mood disorders. Additionally, the gut microbiota interacts with the endocrine and immune systems, shaping inflammatory responses and stress adaptation mechanisms. This review explores the intricate connections between sleep and the gut microbiota, integrating emerging research on microbiota-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and chrononutrition, as potential interventions to restore sleep homeostasis and improve health outcomes",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02722v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The human neocortex is functionally organised at its highest level along a continuous sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy. This study characterises the AS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls. Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation, we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.02063v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cognitive control is a suite of processes that helps individuals pursue goals despite resistance or uncertainty about what to do. Although cognitive control has been extensively studied as a dynamic feedback loop of perception, valuation, and action, it remains incompletely understood as a cohesive dynamic and distributed neural process. Here, we critically examine the history of and advances in the study of cognitive control, including how metaphors and cultural norms of power, morality, and rationality are intertwined with definitions of control, to consider holistically how different models explain which brain regions act as controllers. Controllers, the source of top-down signals, are typically localized in regions whose neural activations implement elementary component processes of control, including conflict monitoring and behavioral inhibition. Top-down signals from these regions guide the activation of other task-specific regions, biasing them towards task-specific activity patterns. A relatively new approach, network control theory, has roots in dynamical systems theory and systems engineering. This approach can mathematically show that controllers are regions with strongly nested and recurrent anatomical connectivity that efficiently propagate top-down signals, and precisely estimate the amount, location, and timing of signaling required to bias global activity to task-specific patterns. The theory converges with prior evidence, offers new mathematical tools and intuitions for understanding control loops across levels of analysis, and naturally produces graded predictions of control across brain regions and modules of psychological function that have been unconsidered or marginalized. We describe how prior approaches converge and diverge, noting directions for future integration to improve understanding of how the brain instantiates cognitive control.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.01868v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Clarifying the neural basis of speech intelligibility is critical for computational neuroscience and digital speech processing. Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that intelligibility modulates cortical activity beyond simple acoustics, primarily in the superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri. However, previous studies have been largely confined to clean speech, leaving it unclear whether the brain employs condition-invariant neural codes across diverse listening environments. To address this gap, we propose a novel architecture built upon a deep state space model for decoding intelligibility from fMRI signals, specifically tailored to their high-dimensional temporal structure. We present the first attempt to decode intelligibility across acoustically distinct conditions, showing our method significantly outperforms classical approaches. Furthermore, region-wise analysis highlights contributions from auditory, frontal, and parietal regions, and cross-condition transfer indicates the presence of condition-invariant neural codes, thereby advancing understanding of abstract linguistic representations in the brain.",
