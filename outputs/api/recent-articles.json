      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "content": "India is a profoundly diverse nation-state where constitutional provisions for two official and 22 Scheduled languages overlay a vast substratum of numerous Non-Scheduled languages and over a thousand distinct mother tongues, creating a rich and layered linguistic hierarchy. The trajectory of linguistic growth of young Indians is invariably multilingual and multidialectal and involves at least one L1, followed most often by Hindi and English or other languages. We carried out a qualitative study with over over a thousand students entering university using a modified LEAP questionnaire for self-assessment of fluency, literacy, domain of use, and time course of language acquisition and loss. We explore the interaction between heritage language, multilingualism, and the formal (trilingual) education policy and show that they intersect to redraw the linguistic profiles of individuals with shifting language dominance, and impact linguistic ability, especially in L1. We also find that the understanding of \u201cheritage language\u201d needs to be more nuanced in this particular context of multilingualism and language acquisition.",

      "title": "Aligning machines and minds: neural encoding for high-level visual cortices based on image captioning task",
      "content": "Objective. Neural encoding of visual stimuli aims to predict brain responses in the visual cortex to different external inputs. Deep neural networks trained on relatively simple tasks such as image classification have been widely applied in neural encoding studies of early visual areas. However, due to the complex and abstract nature of semantic representations in high-level visual cortices, their encoding performance and interpretability remain limited. Approach. We propose a novel neural encoding model guided by the image captioning task. During image captioning, an attention module is employed to focus on key visual objects. In the neural encoding stage, a flexible receptive field (RF) module is designed to simulate voxel-level visual fields. To bridge the domain gap between these two processes, we introduce the Atten-RF module, which effectively aligns attention-guided visual representations with voxel-wise brain activity patterns. Main results. Experiments on the large-scale natural scenes dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior average encoding performance across seven high-level visual cortices, with a mean squared error of 0.765, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.443, and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.245. Significance. By leveraging the guidance and alignment provided by a complex vision-language task, our model enhances the prediction of voxel activity in high-level visual cortex, offering a new perspective on the neural encoding problem. Furthermore, various visualization techniques provide deeper insights into the neural mechanisms underlying visual information processing.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

A 32-year-old male with bipolar disorder and prior venous thromboembolism presented with severe occipital headache, progressive blurred vision, and a brief sensory episode.
