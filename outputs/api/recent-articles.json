      "title": "Mapping the Cerebello-Hippocampal Circuit: Normative Patterns and Sex-Dependent Connectivity",
      "content": "Cerebello hippocampal (CBHP) interactions have been implicated in spatial abilities and reinforcement learning, yet their relationship to behavior and differences in connectivity with sex in early adulthood are unclear. Resting CBHP network patterns have yet to be established in young adults. Mapping the normative resting-state CBHP connectivity pattern is essential for identifying when CBHP circuitry becomes behaviorally relevant across the lifespan and for detecting early circuit-level deviations that may precede neurodegenerative or endocrine disruption. We combined resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with measures of cognition in 1,081 healthy young adults (22 to 37 years, 54% women) from the Human Connectome Project S1200 to map CBHP functional connectivity (FC), examine sex differences, and define its relationship with performance across episodic memory, visuospatial, and executive function tasks. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI FC between the right cerebellum and left hippocampus were quantified. In our CB-HP mapping, we found: 1) negative relationships between the entire HP axis and cerebellar regions: vermis VII; lobules VI, VIIb, and VIII; Crus I & II, and 2) positive relationships between most of the HP axis and ventral/medial cerebellar regions. We revealed sex differences in CB-HP such that females had greater FC than males between anterior to mid-hippocampal regions and medial cerebellar regions: vermis IV-VI; lobules VI, VIII, IX; and Crus II. We predicted CBHP FC patterns would show strong positive associations with cognitive measures (i.e., episodic memory, visuospatial processing, working memory, and executive function); however, we did not find any associations after multiple comparisons correction (pFDR > 0.05). Together, our findings detail a functional atlas of the CBHP circuit in young adulthood and highlight sex differences within. Our results provide a foundation for understanding functionally based gradients between these two regions.",

      "title": "PI-FC: Pre-training Individual-specific Functional Connectome through State-invariant Contrastive Learning",
      "content": "Functional MRI enables non-invasive mapping of brain connectivity, yet its clinical translation remains hindered by uncontrolled state-dependent variability that obscures individual-specific signatures during routine scanning. Here we introduce PI-FC - a deep learning framework leveraging state-invariant contrastive learning to extract stable individual brain signatures across diverse arousal levels, cognitive states, and temporal scales spanning tens of seconds to hours. PI-FC achieves equivalent phenotypic prediction accuracy using substantially reduced scanning time, and eliminates state-dependent effects varying task demands and brain states. Trained on 36,119 subjects across 8 independent datasets, our model demonstrates superior cross-site generalization and outperforms traditional functional connectome (FC) in predicting neuropsychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, autism, depression, and anxiety. Furthermore, PI-FC enables zero-shot inference of brain age, biological sex, and cognitive ability without site-specific retraining. Overall, PI-FC represents a robust, clinically scalable framework that overcomes fundamental barriers to real-world deployment of precision functional neuroimaging.",

      "title": "PEDF peptides rescue defects in neurite morphogenesis and intracellular calcium response in cortical neurons from mice exposed to valproic acid",
      "content": "Pigment epithelial-derived factor (PEDF) is a multifunctional protein produced predominantly by the retinal pigment epithelium and expressed in many tissues, including the brain, highlighting its participation in crucial processes, such as neuroprotection and angiogenesis. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD, are characterized by neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including altered neurite formation, spine formation, and neuronal activities. Many efforts have been made to resolve NDDs, but until now, some symptoms remain untargeted. PEDF is involved in many steps of neurodevelopment. The treatment of PEDF peptide might improve the outcome of NDD symptoms by altering neuronal morphologies. We used PEDF peptides that contain different functional domains to study the effect of administering PEDF peptides on neuronal morphology in a prenatal valproic acid (VPA)-exposed mouse model. We identified that the treatment with PEDF peptides rectified the abnormalities in neurite formation and spine formation in VPA-exposed cortical neurons. In vitro calcium imaging showed abnormalities in the spontaneous activity in VPA-exposed cortical neurons. Treatment of a short PEDF peptide normalized intracellular calcium response to the control level. Accordingly, PEDF peptides have the prospect of serving as potential treatments for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD.",

      "title": "PELICAN: a Longitudinal Image Processing Pipeline for Analyzing Structural Magnetic Resonance Images in Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease Populations",
      "content": "Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for accurate non-invasive assessment of the brain's structure and its longitudinal changes. Availability of large scale longitudinal MRI datasets enables us to probe brain changes in health and disease, and derive longitudinal trajectories of brain morphometry based measures to estimate brain atrophy and other disease-related abnormalities. In contrast to their cross-sectional counterparts, image processing pipelines that have been designed for longitudinal data can reduce noise in the derived measurements by disentangling the within and between subject variabilities, improving the sensitivity of the downstream models in detecting more subtle longitudinal changes. Here we present PELICAN, our open source multi-contrast longitudinal image processing pipeline, that has been designed and extensively validated for use in longitudinal settings and populations with neurodegenerative disorders. PELICAN can use population specific average templates as intermediate targets to derive accurate nonlinear registrations for cases with substantial levels of atrophy, which commonly used pipelines struggle to process. We evaluated PELICAN's performance across over 34,000 MRIs from multiple aging and neurodegenerative disorder cohorts, and compared its reliability and failure rates against FreeSurfer as a widely used image processing tool, showing superior performance of PELICAN compared to FreeSurfer, both in terms of failure rate and reliability. Our results demonstrate that PELICAN can be used to accurately process MRIs of individuals with neurodegenerative disease who present with greater levels of atrophy and white matter lesion burden.",

      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies.

The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",
