      "content": "Real-world neuroimaging requires true portability and sensitivity to detect signals from neuronal activity. Conventional methods such as MRI, EEG, or PET are constrained by their size and instrumentation complexity. Near Infra-Red (NIR) based optical methods have the potential for sensitive detection with a smaller footprint. Despite rapid advances in NIR detection there is no known device that is implementable using off-the-shelf integrated microprocessors and possesses the above desired characteristics along with proven sensitivity to detect task evoked responses. Here, we present a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled, high-sensitivity wearable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device designed for untethered cortical hemodynamic monitoring during naturalistic cognitive tasks. Our fully integrated optical sensing device merges optical data acquisition and wireless transmission into a compact, cable-free platform with a very small footprint. This enables continuous multi-channel recording without placing any constraint on the movement of the subject. We validate our device for reliable detection of task-evoked oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin dynamics in the forearm, primary motor cortex, primary visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. Subsequently, we capture real-time forebrain activity during a screen-based learning and memory task, revealing robust goal-specific hemodynamic responses. We formulate a method to identify the instances of peak neuronal activity and follow the task Evoked Instances of Differential Oxygen influx(tEIDO) as the subject is engaged in a task. These results highlight the potential of our proposed fNIRS device as a mobile neuroimaging solution for next-generation brain-computer interfaces and real-world cognitive monitoring.",

      "content": "Aging is associated with impaired CSF clearance in preclinical models, but its impact on blood-brain barrier (BBB) health and glymphatic function in humans remains unclear. We aimed to compare healthy younger and older adults using multimodal MRI to assess age-related changes in BBB permeability and glymphatic clearance, and to examine the relationships between these measures. Thirty participants were recruited (12 younger, 26 {+/-} 3 years; 18 older, 75 {+/-} 7 years). Diffusion-prepared arterial spin labeling measured the water exchange rate (Kw) across the BBB; free water (FW) imaging quantified extracellular free water in white matter; and diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces (DTI-ALPS) assessed glymphatic function. Older individuals showed reduced whole-brain Kw (p=0.021), increased white matter FW (p=0.002), and reduced DTI-ALPS (p<0.001) compared to younger adults. Kw associated with both DTI-ALPS ({beta}=0.402x10-2, p=0.022) and FW ({beta}=-0.676x10-3, p=0.008). Reduced Kw may reflect impaired BBB function, while reduced DTI-ALPS and increased FW indicate impaired glymphatic clearance. FW partially mediated the relationship between Kw and DTI-ALPS, suggesting a potential mechanistic link. Overall, this study provides novel multimodal MRI insights into BBB and glymphatic alterations in healthy aging and may inform the development of MRI biomarkers to preserve cognitive health.",

      "title": "Early life stress induces social behavioral deficits and peripheral biomarker alterations in adolescence that perpetuate intergenerationally",
      "content": "Early life stress (ELS) increases the likelihood of developing chronic health problems including mental illness. In humans, deficits in social behavior often emerge during adolescence and correlate with later-life psychiatric diagnoses. We examined in mice the effects of a limited bedding and nesting (LBN) model of ELS on pup ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during postnatal days 3-9 (P3-P9). Then on P30, an adolescent timepoint, we assessed social behavior as well as thymus involution and adrenal hypertrophy, both biomarkers of stress. We found reductions in USVs as early as P3, resembling low levels normally seen later in development. There were few changes in SI, with deficits observed only after restraint stress in female LBN mice. Surprisingly, thymus weights were augmented and adrenal glands were smaller in LBN adolescent mice, opposite to alterations typically observed after chronic adult stress. LBN also produced signs of precocious puberty in both sexes, especially in cohorts of LBN-exposed offspring bred to create second-generation LBN offspring that subsequently underwent LBN, indicating perpetuation across generations. Together, these data suggest that stress in early life has distinct and diverse effects, including accelerating several processes, and that some of these effects persist intergenerationally.",

      "content": "IntroductionPrism adaptation is a well-established paradigm for studying sensorimotor plasticity, known to produce not only motor after-effects but also changes in spatial cognition. Whether visuomotor rotation\u2014a similar form of sensorimotor adaptation\u2014elicits comparable cognitive transfer remains unclear.MethodsParticipants performed visuomotor rotation tasks involving either leftward or rightward 15\u00b0 rotations. The perturbation was introduced either abruptly (within one trial) or gradually (over 34 trials). To assess potential cognitive transfer, participants completed a perceptual line bisection task before and after adaptation.ResultsNo condition (leftward/rightward or abrupt/gradual) induced measurable cognitive after-effects in line bisection performance, indicating an absence of transfer from sensorimotor to spatial-cognitive domains. However, a novel finding emerged: visuomotor rotation enhanced participants\u2019 representational acuity, reflected in improved sensitivity when judging the midpoint of a line. This effect was most pronounced following gradual perturbations and persisted beyond the adaptation phase.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate a clear dissociation between the cognitive and perceptual consequences of visuomotor adaptation. Visuomotor rotation thus provides a reliable means to study sensorimotor plasticity without altering spatial representation\u2014a methodological advantage for investigating populations with atypical spatial biases. The enhancement of representational acuity further suggests that sensorimotor learning can refine spatial discrimination independently of cognitive recalibration.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",

      "title": "Transient Inhibition of the Posterior Parietal Cortex Affects Action-related But Not Action-unrelated Visual Processing during Path Integration",
      "content": "Path integration refers to the ability to monitor self-motion cues to keep track of changes in position and orientation. This function is often assumed to rely predominantly on medial temporal lobe structures containing grid, place, and head direction cells. Recent evidence, however, suggests that key navigational computations may occur outside this system, for example, in posterior parietal areas. Here, we adopted a novel perspective derived from animal research and examined whether human path integration relies on processing streams in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), depending on the involvement of actively controlled motion as opposed to passive perception of visual optic flow. We compared the effects of inhibiting the PPC via TMS on two path integration tasks in a virtual reality, only one of which involved active control of a visually simulated forward movement. Behavioral performance showed that distance judgments were selectively affected in the action-related path integration task. This finding shows that the processing of actively controlled motion depends on computations in the PPC, whereas passive processing of optic flow is largely independent of the PPC computations. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that the PPC plays a critical role for the integration of goal locations and self-positional signals within an egocentric frame of reference. In addition to the medial temporal lobe, the posterior parietal system is recruited during tasks involving actively controlled movements, whereas medial temporal computations are sufficient for passive monitoring of positional changes.",

      "title": "Preserved Neural Dynamics across Arm- and Brain-controlled Movements",
      "content": "The neural response for motor control is complex and dynamic; it has been found to dramatically transit from planning to executing movements. As brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) can directly connect the brain and the external world by yielding comparable motor outcomes with artificial apparatus, a central question remains whether the neural dynamics underlying brain-control movement share characteristics or mechanism in natural neural motor control. To enable a systematic comparison, we developed a feedforward BMI framework that enables rapid cursor control to intercept moving targets. This BMI allowed monkeys to voluntarily initiate neural states which controlled the direction and timing of a launched ballistic movement, like skeet shooting. Based on this, we found similar neural representation patterns and computational structure across brain- and arm-control conditions. Notably, in addition to resembling the rotational structure in natural reaching, the neural population dynamics during open loop control also shared preserved manifold with those during arm interception. These findings suggest a fundamental principle and reveal a set of basic computational motifs, for neural control of movement in an abstract hierarchy independent of constraints from actuators. This study thus has potential to reshape the consideration of how BMIs assist paralyzed patients in interacting with dynamic environments and promote next-generation BMI systems.",

      "title": "A non-canonical top-down pathway regulating relapse to opioid",
      "content": "The high relapse rates are major challenges in treating opioid addiction. However, it remains poorly understood the mechanisms underlying long-lasting vulnerability to relapse. Here, we identify the cortico-subthalamic projection from the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) to the zona incerta (ZI) as a key circuit for controlling relapse to opioid. We uncover that an ensemble of RSG glutamatergic neurons that locate in layer 5 and express B subtype cholecystokinin receptor (RSGGlu-Cckbr ensemble) are critically implicated in the encoding and retrieval of opioid-associated memories, leading to relapse to opioid via innervating ZI GABAergic (ZIGABA) rather than dopaminergic neurons. We further identify that the Cckergic neurons from anterodorsal nucleus of thalamus (AD thalamus) orchestrates RSGGlu-Cckbr-ZIGABA circuit function via release of cholecystokinin (Cck) in RSG. These results elucidate a previously unknown non-canonical top-down pathway regulating relapse to opioid and shed new light on the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat relapse to opioids.",

      "title": "\u201cPICS\u201d: a novel patient-specific landmark for thalamic surgical interventions in the posterior limb of the internal capsule signal",
      "content": "IntroductionDifficulties in direct visualization of thalamic subnuclei are likely a contributor to inconsistent surgical outcomes among patients with medication refractory tremors. We present a new MRI landmark, represented by a bright signal in the posterior limb of the internal capsule signal (PICS), that can serve as a consistent marker for indirect location of the Vim nucleus of the thalamus. We evaluated the visibility of PICS across multiple MRI sequences at 7Tesla (T) and 3T, and its anatomical characteristics were identified using tractography.MethodsOne healthy control and 15 essential tremor (ET) patients were scanned. To characterize the PICS fibers, two posterior limb of internal capsule (pLIC) tractography schemes were conducted with cortical ROIs as seeds and the pLIC as a waypoint: (i) gross motor cortical ROIs, (ii) M1 and S1 homunculus. Finally, intra- and post-operative clinical data were merged for one ET DBS patient to show correspondence between the parcellation results and clinical observations.ResultsPICS was consistently identified across multiple MRI sequences. Tractography analyses identified PICS to correlate with the distribution of motor fibers from the internal capsule. For the M1 homunculus, two somatotopic clusters were observed: one including mostly trunk, lower and upper limbs; and another, more anteriorly, with head/face clustering with tongue/larynx. For the S1 homunculus, the trunk region was overall the most posterior region followed by the upper limb/face anteriorly and Area2. Intra-operative stimulation at two different depths resulted in pLIC-specific side effect in the tongue/face. At those depths, measurements showed closer proximity of the DBS electrode to M1 clusters of head/face and tongue/larynx, validating the imaging findings.ConclusionPICS appears to be a reliable radiological marker comprising cortico-spinal tracts, in isolation from corticobulbar tracts fibers. It is consistently located lateral to the Vim, making it a potential landmark to infer Vim location and help refine targeting for thalamic procedures. The parcellations of the pLIC using M1 homunculus could potentially inform lead or ablation location based on side effect profiles (e.g., head/face/tongue vs. trunk/limbs). Therefore, proximity or distance to PICS may potentially guide lead placement to avoid procedure-related capsular side effects while optimizing benefits.",

Participants performed a \u201cWhack-a-Mole\u201d eye movement task on a VR platform. Fixation time and task error rates were recorded, and fNIRS was used to measure changes in brain oxygenation. The differences in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration in brain regions between PD patients and healthy controls were assessed during task performance.ResultsThe PD group exhibited a significantly higher task error rate compared to the control group (p\u202f=\u202f0.02), and a significantly longer mean fixation time (p\u202f=\u202f0.001). fNIRS results revealed that the PD group had considerably higher oxygenated hemoglobin concentrations in the bilateral primary visual cortex (V1), visual association cortex, primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and auditory cortex compared to the control group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionPD patients exhibit significant eye movement behavioral impairments during the execution of complex visual tasks, accompanied by compensatory brain functional activation in relevant brain regions.

      "title": "Post-stroke seizures in animal models: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundPost-stroke seizures (PSS) are a common complication of stroke and can exacerbate neurological injury, yet their study in preclinical models remains limited. Understanding the relationship between PSS and outcomes in animal models is critical for improving translational research and informing therapeutic strategies.ObjectiveTo systematically review and meta-analyze the incidence, consequences, and methodological quality of studies investigating PSS in animal models of ischemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).MethodsA systematic search of Embase, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science (June 2024, updated May 2025) identified original, peer-reviewed animal studies published after 1999 that reported seizures and outcomes (lesion volume, neurological deficit scores, behavior, edema, inflammation) without interventional treatments. Data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, and a random-effects meta-analysis was performed for lesion volume.ResultsOf 6,005 studies screened, 10 met inclusion criteria, with eight eligible for meta-analysis. Seizure incidence ranged from 17.5\u201382% in focal ischemia and 45\u201367% in ICH models. Lesion volume was the most commonly measured outcome. Meta-analysis revealed that seizures were associated with larger lesion volumes in focal ischemia models (Hedge\u2019s G\u202f=\u202f1.598, p\u202f=\u202f0.038) but not in ICH models (Hedge\u2019s G\u202f=\u202f0.180, p\u202f=\u202f0.468). Across studies, seizures were linked to more severe neurological deficits in focal ischemia but showed no consistent effect in ICH. Risk-of-bias assessment indicated high risk in all studies, with frequent methodological limitations including lack of random outcome assessment, use of only young male animals, and absence of a priori sample size calculations. Publication bias was suggested by funnel plot asymmetry.ConclusionThis review highlights a scarcity of rigorous preclinical studies on PSS, substantial heterogeneity across animal models, and methodological limitations that hinder translatability. Findings suggest a differential impact of stroke type on seizure outcomes, with focal ischemia-associated seizures linked to larger lesions and poorer neurological function. Future research should employ long-term, rigorously designed studies using diverse animal populations, standardized seizure monitoring, and careful reporting to enhance clinical relevance and guide therapeutic development.",
