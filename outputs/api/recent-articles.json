      "title": "Preclinical Evaluation of a Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent for Intracranial Application: A 30-Day GLP Canine Study",
      "content": "Background: Zotarolimus-Eluting Stents (ZES) are increasingly used off-label for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). However, foundational, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) compliant preclinical safety data specific to the cerebral vasculature is lacking. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic evaluation of the technical feasibility, anatomic features, and 30-day clinical safety profile of the Onyx Frontier ZES (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) in a GLP-compliant canine intracranial model. Methods: In a prospective GLP study, a 2.0 x 8.0 mm Onyx Frontier ZES was implanted in the basilar artery of twelve healthy mongrel canines pre-treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. Vertebral artery tortuosity was assessed via angiography and graded as Type I (non-tortuous/straight), Type II (moderately tortuous/S-shaped), or Type III (severely tortuous/coiled). The primary endpoints were procedural success and 30-day safety, assessed via angiography, serial neurological examinations, and comprehensive clinical monitoring. Results: Technical success was achieved in 100% of animals (12/12). The cohort exhibited challenging anatomy, with a mean basilar artery diameter of 1.39 {+/-} 0.10 mm. Tortuosity analysis revealed that 33.3% of animals were Type I (mild), 58.3% were Type II (moderate), and 8.3% were Type III (severe). Post-procedure, mild vasospasm was observed in all cases, with only one canine requiring intra-arterial verapamil. A single case (8.3%) of self-limiting contrast extravasation occurred without clinical sequelae. At 30 days, there was no mortality, and no animals suffered a neurological adverse event. Minor clinical events were unrelated to the device, and comprehensive clinical pathology panels revealed no evidence of systemic toxicity or a significant inflammatory response. Conclusion: This first-of-its-kind preclinical study demonstrates that implantation of the Onyx Frontier ZES is technically feasible with a 100% success rate in a sub-2mm vessel model with significant tortuosity and has an excellent 30-day safety profile with no clinical evidence of neurotoxicity. These findings provide foundational preclinical data supporting further investigation of this technology for treating ICAD in human subjects.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all! With Advent of Code about to start, I wanted to share a tool I built to make the workflow smoother for Python users.</p> <p>What My Project Does</p> <p>elf is a command line tool that handles the repetitive parts of Advent of Code. It fetches your puzzle input and caches it, submits answers safely, and pulls private leaderboards. It uses Typer and Rich for a clean CLI and Pydantic models for structured data. The goal is to reduce boilerplate so you can focus on solving puzzles.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/cak/elf\">https://github.com/cak/elf</a></p> <p>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/elf/\">https://pypi.org/project/elf/</a></p> <p>Target Audience</p> <p>This tool is meant for anyone solving Advent of Code in Python. It is designed for day to day AoC usage. It aims to help both new participants and long time AoC users who want a smoother daily workflow.</p> <p>Comparison</p> <p>There are a few existing AoC helpers, but most require manual scripting or lack caching, leaderboard support, or guardrails for answer submission. elf focuses on being fast, simple, and safe to use every day during AoC. It emphasizes clear output, transparent caching, and a consistent interface.</p> <p>If you try it out, I would love any feedback: bugs, ideas, missing features, anything. Hope it helps make Day 1 a little smoother for you. </p> <p>Happy coding and good luck this year! \ud83c\udf84\u2b50\ufe0f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nilvalues\"> /u/Nilvalues </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1paj821/i_built_a_fast_advent_of_code_helper_cli_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1paj821/i_built_a_fast_advent_of_code_helper_cli_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",
