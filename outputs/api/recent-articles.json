      "content": "<p><i>Update 30/09/2025: I have added a reply by Andrew Gelman below my original blog post.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>We recently\nposted a preprint criticizing the idea of Type S and M errors (<a href=\"https://osf.io/2phzb_v1\">https://osf.io/2phzb_v1</a>). From our abstract:\n\u201cWhile these concepts have been proposed to be useful both when designing a\nstudy (prospective) and when evaluating results (retroactive), we argue that\nthese statistics do not facilitate the proper design of studies, nor the\nmeaningful interpretation of results.\u201d</p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In a recent\n<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/09/25/on-the-poor-statistical-properties-of-the-p-curve-meta-analytic-procedure/#comment-2403979\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> that is mainly on p-curve analysis, Gelman writes briefly about Type\nS and M errors, stating that he does not see them as tools that should be used\nregularly, but that they mainly function as a \u2018rhetorical tool\u2019:</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">I offer\na three well-known examples of statistical ideas arising in the field of\nscience criticism, three methods whose main value is rhetorical:</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">[\u2026]</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The\nconcepts of Type M and Type S errors, which I developed with Francis Tuerlinckx\nin 2000 and John Carlin in 2014. This has been an influential idea\u2013ok, not as\ninfluential as Ioannidis\u2019s paper!\u2013and I like it a lot, but it doesn\u2019t\ncorrespond to a method that I will typically use in practice. To me, the value\nof the concepts of Type M and Type S errors is they help us understand certain\nexisting statistical procedures, such as selection on statistical significance,\nthat have serious problems. There\u2019s mathematical content here for sure, but I\nfundamentally think of these error calculations as having rhetorical value for\nthe design of studies and interpretation of reported results.</span></i></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The main\nsentence of interest here is that Gelman says this is not a method he would use\nin practice. I was surprised, because in their article Gelman and Carlin (2014)\nrecommend the calculation of Type S and M errors more forcefully: \u201cWe suggest\nthat design calculations be performed after as well as before data collection\nand analysis.\u201d Throughout their article, they compare design calculations where\nType S and M errors are calculated to power analyses, which are widely seen as\na requirement before data collection of any hypothesis testing study. For\nexample, in the abstract they write \u201cpower analysis is flawed in that a narrow\nemphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study\ndesign. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can\noften be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of\ntheir own studies, we recommend design calculations\u201d.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">They also say\ndesign calculations are useful when interpreting results, and that they add\nsomething to p-values and effect sizes, which again seems to suggest they can complement\nordinary data analysis: \u201cOur retrospective analysis provided useful insight, beyond\nwhat was revealed by the estimate, confidence interval, and p value that came\nfrom the original data summary.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin, 2014, p. 646). In\ngeneral, they seem to suggest design analyses are done before or after data analysis:\n\u201cFirst, it is indeed preferable to do a design analysis ahead of time, but a\nresearcher can analyze data in many different ways\u2014indeed, an important part of\ndata analysis is the discovery of unanticipated patterns (Tukey, 1977) so that it\nis unreasonable to suppose that all potential analyses could have been\ndetermined ahead of time. The second reason for performing postdata design\ncalculations is that they can be a useful way to interpret the results from a\ndata analysis, as we next demonstrate in two examples.\u201d (Gelman &amp; Carlin,\n2014, p. 643).</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">One the other\nhand, in a single sentence in the discussion, they also write: \u201cOur goal in\ndeveloping this software is not so much to provide a tool for routine use but\nrather to demonstrate that such calculations are possible and to allow\nresearchers to play around and get a sense of the sizes of Type S errors and Type\nM errors in realistic data settings.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Maybe I\nhave always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a\npaper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should\nhave understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was\nnever their intention. If the idea is to replace Type 1 and 2 errors, and\nhence, replace power analysis and the interpretation of data, design analysis\nshould be part of every hypothesis testing study. Sentences such as \u201cthe\nrequirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature\nin the subject-matter field\u201d seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could\nbe a requirement for all studies. But maybe I was wrong. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Or maybe I\nwasn\u2019t. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In this <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/11/13/more-on-my-paper-with-john-carlin-on-type-m-and-type-s-errors/\">blog\npost</a>, Gelman writes: \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that\nit gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating\ntheir research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself!\nBecause I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d So,\nhere there seems to be the idea that others routinely use Type S and M errors. And\nin a very early version of the paper with Carlin, available <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/retropower.pdf\">here</a>,\nthe opening sentence also suggests routine use: \u201cThe present article proposes\nan ideal that every statistical analysis be followed up with a power\ncalculation to better understand the inference from the data. As the quotations\nabove illustrate, however, our suggestion contradicts the advice of many\nrespected statisticians. Our resolution of this apparent disagreement is that\nwe perform retrospective power analysis in a different way and for a different\npurpose than is typically recommended in the literature.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Of course,\none good thing about science is that people change their beliefs about things.\nMaybe Gelman one time thought Type S and M errors should be part of \u2018every\nstatistical analysis\u2019 but now sees the tool mainly as a \u2018rhetorical device\u2019. And\nthat is perfectly fine. It is also good to know, because I regular see people\nwho suggest that Type S and M error should routinely be used in practice. I\nguess I can now point them to a blog post where Gelman himself disagrees with\nthat suggestion.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As we explain\nin our preprint, the idea of Type S errors is conceptually incoherent, and any\nprobabilities calculated will be identical to the Type 1 error in directional\ntests, or the false discovery rate, as all that Type S errors do is remove the\npossibility of an effect being 0 from the distribution, but this probability is\nitself 0. We also explain how other tools are better to educate researchers\nabout effect size inflation in studies selected for significance (for which\nGelman would recommend Type M errors), and we actually recommend p-uniform for\nthis, or just teaching people about critical effect sizes.</span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Personally,\nI don\u2019t like rhetorical tools. Although in our preprint we agree that teaching\nthe idea of Type S and M errors can be useful in education, there are also conceptually\ncoherent and practically useful statistical ideas that we can teach instead to\nachieve the same understanding. Rhetorical tools might be useful to convince\npeople who do not think logically about a topic, but I prefer to have a\nslightly higher bar for the scientists that I aim to educate about good\nresearch practices, and I think they are able to understand the problem of low\nstatistical power and selection bias without rhetorical tools. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br /></span></p><div>--Reply by Andrew Gelman--</div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p><div><div style=\"border: 0px;

color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">First, I guess I should've avoided the word \"rhetorical.\" &nbsp;In my post, I characterized Ioannidis's 2005 claim, type M and S errors, and multiverse analysis as \"rhetorical tools\" that have been been useful in the field of science criticism but which I would not use in my own analyses. &nbsp;I could've added to this many other statistical methods including p-values and Bayes factors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">When I describe a statistical method as \"rhetorical\" in this context, I'm not saying it's mathematically invalid or that it's conceptually incoherent (to use your term), nor am I saying these methods should not be used! &nbsp;All these tools can be useful; they just rely on very strong assumptions. &nbsp;P-values and Bayes factors are measures of evidence relative to a null hypothesis (not just an assumption that a particular parameter equals zero, but an entire set of assumptions about the data-generating process) that is irrelevant in the science and decision problems I've seen--but these methods are clearly defined and theoretically justified, and many practitioners get a lot out of them. &nbsp;I very rarely would use p-values or Bayes factors in my work because I'm very rarely interested in this sort of discrepancy from a null hypothesis.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">A related point comes up in my paper with Hill and Yajima, \"Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons\" (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/multiple2f.pdf). &nbsp;Multiple comparisons corrections can be important, indeed I've criticized some published work for misinterpreting evidence by not accounting for multiple comparisons or multiple potential comparisons--but it doesn't come up so much in the context of multilevel modeling.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Ioannidis (2005) is a provocative paper that I think has a lot of value--but you have to be really careful to try to directly apply such an analysis to real data. &nbsp; He's making some really strong assumptions! &nbsp;The logic of his paper is clear, though. &nbsp;O'Rourke and I discuss the challenges of moving from that sort of model to larger conclusions in our 2013 paper (https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/GelmanORourkeBiostatistics.pdf).</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The multiverse is a cool idea, and researchers have found it to be useful. &nbsp;The sociologists Cristobal Young and Erin Cumberworth recently published a book on it (https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/multiverse-analysis/D53C3AB449F6747B4A319174E5C95FA1). &nbsp;I don't think I'd apply the method in my own applied research, though, because the whole idea of the multiverse is to consider all the possible analyses you might have done on a dataset, and if I get to that point I'm more inclined to fit a multilevel model that subsumes all these analyses. &nbsp;I have found multiverse analysis to be useful in understanding research published by others, and maybe it would be useful for my own work too, given that my final published analyses never really include all the possibilities of what I might have done. &nbsp;The point is that this is yet another useful method that can have conceptual value even if I might not apply it to my own work. &nbsp;Again, the term \"rhetorical\" might be misleading, as these are real methods that, like all statistical methods, are appropriate in some settings and not in others.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">So please don't let your personal dislike of the term \"rhetorical tools\" to dissuade you from taking seriously the tools that I happen to have characterized as \"rhetorical,\" as these include p-values, multiple comparisons corrections, Bayesian analysis with point priors, and all sorts of other methods that are rigorously defined and can be useful in many applied settings, including some of yours!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, now on to Type M and Type S errors. &nbsp;You seem to imply that at some time I thought that these \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis,'\" but I can assure you that I have never believed or written such a thing. &nbsp;You put the phrase \"every statistical analysis,\" but this is your phrase, not mine.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">One very obvious way to see that I never thought Type M and Type S errors \"should be part of \u2018every statistical analysis'\" is that, since the appearance of that article in 2014, I've published dozens of applied papers, and in only very few of these did I look at Type M and Type S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">What is that? &nbsp;Why is it that my colleagues and I came up with this idea that has been influential, and which I indeed think can be very useful and which I do think should often be used by practitioners, but I only use it myself?</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">The reason is that the focus of our work on Type M and Type S errors has been to understand selection on statistical significance (as in that notorious estimate that early childhood intervention increases adult earnings by 42% on average, but with that being the result of an inferential procedure that, under any reasonable assumptions, greatly overestimates the magnitude of any real effect; that is, Type M error). &nbsp;In my applied work it's very rare that I condition on statistical significance, and so this sort of use of Type M and S errors is not so relevant. &nbsp;So it's perfectly coherent for me to say that Type M and S error analysis is valuable in a wide range of settings that that I think these tools should be applied very widely, without believing that they should be part of \"every statistical analysis\" or that I should necessarily use them for my own analyses.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">That said, more recently I've been thinking that Type M and S errors are a useful approach to understanding statistical estimates more generally, not just for estimates that are conditioned on statistical significance. &nbsp;I'm working with Erik van Zwet and Witold Wi\u0119cek on applying these ideas to Bayesian inferences as well. &nbsp;So I'm actually finding these methods to be more, not less, valuable for statistical understanding, and not just for \"people who do not think logically about a topic\" (in your phrasing). &nbsp;Our papers on these topics are published in real journals and of course they're intended for people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think logically about the topic! &nbsp;And, just to be clear, I believe that you're thinking logically in your post too; I just think you've been misled by my terminology (again, I accept the blame for that), and also you work on different sorts of problems than I do, so it makes sense that a method that I find useful might not be so helpful to you. &nbsp;There are many ways to Rome, which is another point I was making in that blog post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Finally, a few things in your post that I did not address above:</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">1. &nbsp;You quote from my blog post, where I wrote, \u201cNow, one odd thing about my paper with Carlin is that it gives some tools that I recommend others use when designing and evaluating their research, but I would not typically use these tools directly myself! Because I am not wanting to summarize inference by statistical significance.\u201d &nbsp;That's exactly my point above! &nbsp;You had it right there.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">2. &nbsp;You wrote, \"Maybe I have always misinterpreted Gelman and Carlin, 2014, in that I took it as a paper that recommended the regular use of Type S and M errors, and I should have understood that the sentence in the discussion made it clear that this was never their intention.\" &nbsp;So, just to clarify, yes in our paper we recommended the regular use of Type M and S errors, and we still recommend that!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">3. &nbsp;You write that our \"sentences such as 'the requirement of design analysis can stimulate engagement with the existing literature in the subject-matter field' seemed to suggest to me that design analyses could be a requirement for all studies.\" &nbsp;That's right--I actually do think that design analysis should be done for all studies!</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">OK, nothing is done all the time. &nbsp;I guess that some studies are so cheap that there's no need for a design analysis--or maybe we could say that in such studies the design analysis is implicit. &nbsp;For example, if I'm doing A/B testing in a company, and they've done lots of A/B tests before, and I think the new effect will be comparable to previous things being studied, then maybe I just go with the same design as in previous experiments, without performing a formal design analysis. &nbsp;But one could argue that this corresponds to some implicit calculation.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">In any case, yeah, in general I think that a design analysis should come before any study. &nbsp;Indeed, that is what I tell students and colleagues: &nbsp;never collect data before doing a simulation study first. &nbsp;Often we do fake-data simulation after the data come in, to validate our model-fitting strategies, but for a while I've been thinking it's best to do it before.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">This is not controversial advice in statistics, to recommend a design analysis before gathering data! &nbsp;Indeed, in medical research it's basically a requirement. &nbsp;In our paper, Carlin and I argue--and I still believe--that a design analysis using Type M and S errors is more valuable than the traditional Type 1 and 2 errors. &nbsp;But in any case I consider \"design analysis\" to be the general term, with \"power analysis\" being a special case (design analysis looking at the probability of attaining statistical significance). &nbsp;I don't think traditional power analysis is useless--one way you can see this is that we demonstrate power calculations in chapter 16 of Regression and Other Stories, a book that came out several years after my paper with Carlin--; I just think it can be misleading, especially if it is done without consideration of Type M and S errors.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Thanks again for your comments. &nbsp;It's good to have an opportunity to clarify my thinking, and these are important issues in statistics.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">P.S. &nbsp;If you see something on our blog that you disagree with, feel free to comment there directly, as that way you can also reach readers of the original post.</div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><br /></div><div style=\"border: 0px; color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">--</div></div><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">References:&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"></span></p>Lakens, D., Cristian, Xavier-Quintais, G., Rasti, S., Toffalini, E., &amp; Alto\u00e8, G.

      "content": "<p>While cerebrovascular dysfunction and reactive astrocytosis are extensively characterized hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, the dynamic relationship between reactive astrocytes and cerebral vessels remains poorly understood. Here, we used jGCaMP8f and two-photon microscopy to investigate calcium signaling in multiple astrocyte subcompartments, concurrent with changes in cerebral arteriole activity, in fully awake 7- to 8-month-old male and female 5xFAD mice, a model for AD-like pathology, and wild-type (WT) littermates. In the absence of movement, spontaneous calcium transients in barrel cortex occurred more frequently in astrocyte somata, processes, and perivascular regions of 5xFAD mice. However, evoked arteriole dilations (in response to air puff stimulation of contralateral whiskers) and concurrent calcium transients across astrocyte compartments were reduced in 5xFAD mice relative to WTs. Synchronous activity within multicell astrocyte networks was also impaired in the 5xFAD group. Using a custom application to assess functional coupling between astrocyte end feet and immediately adjacent arteriole segments, we detected deficits in calcium response probability in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, end feet calcium transients following arteriole dilations exhibited a slower onset, reduced amplitude, and lacked relative proportionality to vasomotive activity compared with WTs. The results reveal nuanced alterations in 5xFAD reactive astrocytes highlighted by impaired signaling fidelity between astrocyte end feet and cerebral arterioles. The results have important implications for the mechanistic underpinnings of brain hypometabolism and the disruption of neurophysiologic communication found in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The central amygdala (CeA) is an important neuronal hub that integrates external sensory inputs and information about internal states to regulate a range of innate and learned behaviors, including fear learning and memory. Prior studies, leveraging robust fear conditioning assays, have delineated detailed circuit mechanisms underlying the acquisition and recall of fear memories. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in the CeA remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of the clock output molecule mWAKE/ANKFN1 within the CeA of male mice in fear learning and memory. mWAKE is expressed in multiple neuronal subclusters in the lateral CeA. Surprisingly, mWAKE levels do not exhibit rhythmic expression in the CeA. In line with this observation, expression of the core clock genes PER2 and BMAL also does not cycle in the CeA. Consistent with prior studies, loss of mWAKE function increases intrinsic excitability of CeA neurons. Furthermore, conditional knock-out of mWAKE and chemogenetic activation of CeA<sup>mWAKE</sup> neurons impair fear learning and memory. Finally, we show that mWAKE levels in a subset of CeA neurons are reduced following fear conditioning. These findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism modulating the activity and function of CeA neurons in fear learning and memory.</p>",

      "content": "We introduce a vision transformer (ViT)-based approach for automated electrographic seizure classification using time-frequency spectrogram representations of intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected from patients implanted with the NeuroPace\u00ae RNS\u00ae System. The ViT model was trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation on a large-scale dataset of 136,878 iEEG recordings from 113 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, achieving an average test accuracy of 96.8%. Clinical validation was performed on an independent expert-labeled dataset of 3,010 iEEG recordings from 241 patients, where the model achieved 95.8% accuracy and 94.8% F1 score on recordings with unanimous expert agreement, outperforming both ResNet-50 and standard 2D CNN baselines. To evaluate generalizability, the model was tested on a separate out-of-distribution dataset of 136 recordings from 44 patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), achieving over 75% accuracy and F1 scores across all expert comparisons. Explainability analysis revealed focused attention on characteristic electrographic seizure patterns within iEEG time-frequency spectrograms during high-confidence seizure predictions, while more diffuse attention was observed in non-seizure classifications, providing insight into the underlying decision process. By enabling reliable electrographic seizure classification, this approach may assist physicians in the manual review of large volumes of iEEG recordings.",

      "content": "Neuropsychological tests are essential tools for evaluating dementia and related neurocognitive disorders, with their clinical utility determined mainly by their validity. This paper critically reviews the diverse evidence supporting the validity of neuropsychological tests in dementia assessment. Criterion validity is discussed in relation to the tests\u2019 ability to predict clinical diagnoses and underlying brain pathology, with a focus on their sensitivity to functional impairments and progressive neuropathological changes. Construct validity is explored through the lens of cognitive processes underlying test performance, using evidence from correlation structures and experimental paradigms. Furthermore, the paper examines the impact of emerging digital technologies on the evaluation of neuropsychological test validity, highlighting contrasts with traditional validation methods. The review identifies discrepancies between different types of validity evidence, emphasizing the need to contextualize validity within specific clinical and research applications. By addressing the conceptual limitations and trade-offs between validation approaches, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for interpreting validity evidence. Ultimately, it offers theoretical and practical implications for enhancing the robustness of neuropsychological tests in clinical practice and research.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "title": "EEG synchronization signatures for decoding attentional states during continuous force control",
      "content": "IntroductionMind wandering, the shift of attention from an ongoing task to task-unrelated thoughts, is a pervasive cognitive phenomenon often accompanied by detrimental consequences for task performance. While extensively studied in visual and auditory paradigms, attentional fluctuations during visuo-haptic tasks, such as force control, remain underexplored despite their high relevance to real-world skilled activities such as surgical operations or robotic-assisted manipulation. There exists a critical deficiency in exploring signatures of mind wandering from the perspective of neural synchronization.MethodsThis study investigated EEG-based synchronization features to decode attentional states during a novel continuous force control task using the thought-probe method. Nine healthy male participants tracked a dynamically varying target force while scalp EEG and high-frequency force data were recorded synchronously. EEG epochs preceding self-reported attentional probes were labeled as on-task or mind-wandering states. Spectral power and three synchronization features \u2013 cross-frequency coupling, functional connectivity, and neural-behavioral synchronization \u2013 were extracted and compared between on-task and mind-wandering states.Results and discussionResults revealed that the mind-wandering state was characterized by increased alpha power (8-10 Hz) over frontal-posterior regions and reduced occurrence of high alpha-theta harmonic ratios. It also exhibited increased functional connectivity within sensorimotor networks and decreased mutual information between frontal EEG activity and force errors. Support vector machine classifiers for the binary attentional-state classification, utilizing combined spectral power and synchronization features, achieved 75.53% within-participant and 71.57% cross-participant accuracy, outperforming single-feature models. These findings highlight EEG synchronization signatures of mind wandering and demonstrate their feasibility for decoding attentional states during the force control task. This work may provide a foundation for future exploration of haptic-based neurofeedback systems, which could potentially complement existing visual and auditory modalities in applications such as neurocognitive rehabilitation or skilled motor training.",

      "content": "BackgroundOpioid related fatalities remain a public health crisis in the US. Currently, the only way to restore breathing following an opioid induced persistent apnea is with the administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone, but it also reverses analgesia, euphoria, and induces precipitated withdrawal in opioid dependent individuals.MethodsUsing whole-body plethysmography, we assessed changes in breathing frequency in awake behaving mice resulting from a single fentanyl dose (50\u202fmg/kg\u202fi.p.) that followed i.p. pretreatment with saline, vehicle, naloxone (100\u202fmg/kg), cannabidiol (CBD) (250\u202fmg/kg), or CBD\u202f+\u202fnaloxone. Then we assessed the delay to opioid-induced persistent apnea (OIPA) and the median lethal dose (LD50) of fentanyl during a continuous i.c.v. infusion of fentanyl (100\u202fng/min), in urethane anesthetized mice, following pretreatment with saline, vehicle, naloxone (100\u202fmg/kg), CBD (250\u202fmg/kg), or CBD\u202f+\u202fnaloxone i.p.ResultsHere we show acute pretreatment with CBD is as effective as naloxone at preventing opioid-induced respiratory depression from fentanyl in awake mice, and increasing LD50 of fentanyl in urethane anesthetized mice. When pre-administered together, CBD\u202f+\u202fnaloxone, increased LD50 of fentanyl even more than CBD or naloxone alone in urethane anesthetized mice.ConclusionCBD may be an effective preventative therapy for OIPA by increasing the time before apnea onset and potentially enhancing the efficacy of naloxone as an additional strategy to save lives.",

      "content": "IntroductionBrain tumors present a significant threat to human health, demanding accurate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Traditional manual analysis of medical imaging data is inefficient and prone to errors, especially considering the heterogeneous morphological characteristics of tumors. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, we propose MAUNet, a novel 3D brain tumor segmentation model based on U-Net.MethodsMAUNet incorporates a Spatial Convolution (SConv) module, a Contextual Feature Calibration (CFC) module, and a gating mechanism to address these challenges. First, the SConv module employs a Spatial Multi-Dimensional Weighted Attention (SMWA) mechanism to enhance feature representation across channel, height, width, and depth. Second, the CFC module constructs cascaded pyramid pooling layers to extract hierarchical contextual patterns, dynamically calibrating pixelcontext relationships by calculating feature similarities. Finally, to optimize feature fusion efficiency, a gating mechanism refines feature fusion in skip connections, emphasizing critical features while suppressing irrelevant ones.ResultsExtensive experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MAUNet, achieving average Dice scores of 84.5 and 83.8%, respectively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed module, highlighting their contributions to improved segmentation accuracy. Our work provides a robust and efficient solution for automated brain tumor segmentation, offering significant potential for clinical applications.",

MRI modalities included T2-weighted imaging, T1 and T2 relaxation mapping, diffusion tensor imaging, and diffusion kurtosis imaging. Radiomics features were extracted, correlated with behavioral metrics, and analyzed using clustering and radiomics scoring. Logistic regression models incorporating single-modality and multimodal radiomics features were developed and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Subgroup analyses assessed predictive performance and correlations with behavioral and developmental indices.ResultsASD model rats exhibited growth retardation, anxiety-like behavior, and deficits in social interaction and memory, which were alleviated by selenium supplementation. The multimodal radiomics model outperformed single-modality models, achieving the highest area under the ROC curve and strong predictive capability in subgroup analyses. Significant correlations were identified between multimodal radiomics scores and behavioral as well as developmental measures.DiscussionThe cerebellum was a key region affected in ASD, whereas the visual\u2013auditory cortex showed notable responses to selenium treatment. In conclusion, the multimodal radiomics model demonstrates high diagnostic efficacy, highlights the cerebellum as a key region affected in ASD, and suggests the visual\u2013auditory cortex as a primary target of selenium intervention, enhancing predictive accuracy for structural and functional brain improvements post-treatment.",

The subtle and indistinct edge of FCD lesions pose considerable challenges for accurate lesion localization. Therefore, we propose an edge guided segmentation network based on Laplacian pyramid to improve the localization performance of FCD lesions.MethodsThis is a retrospective study evaluated on two independent datasets. The proposed Laplacian Edge Mix UNet (LEM-UNet) builds upon the MedNeXt baseline and incorporates the Laplacian Edge Attention (LEA) block and the Multi-strategy Feature Fusion (MFF) block. LEA block captures lesion details and edge information during the encoding phase by integrating Laplacian pyramid feature maps with an attention mechanism, while MFF block fuses edge features with high level features during the decoding phase.ResultsThe model's performance was assessed through 5-fold cross-validation across both Open and Private Datasets, demonstrating superior performance. The average Dice Coefficient achieved 0.452 and 0.597 on the Open and Private Datasets, respectively, representing improvements of 2.40% and 2.90% compared to the baseline model.DiscussionThe results demonstrate the importance of focusing on lesion edge in the FCD segmentation task. The integration of the Laplacian pyramid enhances the mode's ability to capture lesions with blurred edge and subtle features.

The results showed that: (1) shared story (vs. exclusive story) elicited higher levels of emotion perception, both for self and other (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), and friends (vs. stranger) perceived their friends\u2019 negative emotions more strongly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). (2) Higher IBS was observed at the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG; BA 10) when shared story in friend than shared story in stranger (p_FWE < 0.05). The results indicate that with the deepening of friendships, the overlap between the two parties increases, resulting in higher emotional resonance when sharing common experiences. These findings provide brain imaging evidence supporting the involvement of emotion perception during communication.",

      "title": "From automatic integration to selective control: time-resolved effects of sensory cues on numerical comparison",
      "content": "IntroductionApproximate numerical comparison is often influenced by various non-numerical sensory cues, yet whether they act via uniform inhibition (inhibitory control theory) or cue-weighted integration (sensory integration theory) remains debated.MethodsTo clarify this theoretical controversy, the present study tested a cue-specific, temporally staged account by orthogonally manipulating numerosity with a holistic, highweight cue (convex hull) and a basic, lower-weight cue (average dot size) while recording fronto-central ERPs (P2, N450). Twenty-five adults performed a rapid dot array comparison under four congruency conditions.ResultsBehavior showed clear convex-hull dominance: accuracy was high whenever convex hull aligned with numerosity and dropped when it conflicted, regardless of dot-size consistency; response times were unchanged. ERPs revealed a two-stage dynamic: the early P2 selectively tracked dot-size congruency (larger for dot-size\u2013congruent trials), consistent with automatic integration of basic features, whereas the later N450 scaled with conflict structure and cue weight (fully congruent < dot-size\u2013congruent < fully incongruent < convex-hull\u2013congruent/dot-size\u2013incongruent), with no latency differences.DiscussionThese converging results support a time-resolved, weightsensitive mechanism in which basic features bias integration early and holistic configurations dominate later choice and recruit control when misaligned. The account reconciles sensory-integration and inhibitory-control views and motivates further tests of how cue\u2013cue and cue\u2013number conflicts shape numerical decisions.",

      "content": "Single-channel EEG-based sleep staging methods are well-suited for wearable applications in home environments, offering a practical solution to reduce the diagnostic burden on clinical institutions and address the growing demand for large-scale sleep monitoring. However, its reliability remains a critical concern compared to multi-channel polysomnography (PSG) used in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based sleep staging model and conduct a systematic investigation into the causal-inspired analysis between EEG channel selection and staging reliability. Our experiments reveal that electrodes positioned over the central brain region yield significantly higher accuracy, macro-F1, and consistency in sleep stage classification compared to those located in frontal or occipital regions. These findings provide causal insights into the spatial determinants of perceptual reliability in EEG-based sleep monitoring, supporting the design of robust wearable systems.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe functional connectivity topology of the primary visual cortex (V1) shapes sensory processing and cross-modal integration, yet how different sensory modalities reorganize V1 network architecture remains unclear. We hypothesized that multimodal input drives a shift from hub-centric, modular processing toward globally integrated, distributed configurations.MethodsWe performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice to record population activity in V1 during unimodal visual (V) and bimodal visuotactile (V+T) stimulation. From fluorescence time series, we constructed functional connectivity networks and quantified graph-theoretical metrics, including betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, degree centrality, global efficiency, and modularity. Networks were computed per animal and compared across conditions using appropriate non-parametric statistics.ResultsUnimodal visual stimulation increased betweenness centrality and highlighted prominent hub nodes, supporting locally modular, hub-centric information control. In contrast, bimodal visuotactile stimulation elevated closeness centrality and global efficiency, broadened connectivity, and reduced modularity, indicating enhanced global integration with more distributed information flow. Moreover, under unimodal conditions the top five centrality nodes exhibited significantly stronger calcium responses than other neurons, whereas this response hierarchy was abolished under bimodal stimulation.DiscussionV1 dynamically balances local specialization and global integration through context-dependent topological reconfiguration: unimodal processing relies on hub-centric, modular architectures, while cross-modal input promotes globally optimized, distributed networks with higher connectivity efficiency. These findings provide a network-level framework for multisensory integration and offer insights relevant to theories of sensory computation and potential strategies to harness cross-modal plasticity.",

      "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",

      "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
      "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",
