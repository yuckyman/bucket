      "title": "Prenatal Downregulation of CB1 Cannabinoid Receptors in the Mouse Prefrontal Cortex Disrupts Cortical Lamination and Induces a Transcriptional Signature Associated with Social Interaction Deficits",
      "content": "<p>Endocannabinoid signaling exerts a neurodevelopmental regulatory role via CB<sub>1</sub> cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs), which control pyramidal neuron differentiation, migration, and axonal guidance. Here, we investigated the long-lasting consequences of transient prenatal CB<sub>1</sub>R downregulation within the mouse prefrontal cortex by assessing its impact on gene expression, neuronal electrophysiological properties, and animal behavioral traits. Transient loss of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs as induced by in-utero small-interference RNA electroporation at Embryonic Day 14.5, when upper-layer neurons are generated, arrested cell migration leading to ectopic neurons that populated deep layers. Whole-cell current&ndash;clamp recordings showed that ectopic neurons are less excitable (increased afterhyperpolarization amplitude, decreased sag, lower firing frequency) than deep-layer&ndash;native pyramidal neurons. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), identified by microarray characterization of FACS-sorted electroporated neurons, were significantly enriched in pathways related to cortical development, regulation of cell migration, neurotransmitter secretion, and cytoskeletal organization. Gene set enrichment analysis also supported enrichment in pathways associated with neurodegenerative disorders and synaptic function. The gene expression profile of siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived neurons showed DEGs that had been previously associated with intellectual disability, schizophrenia, and autism. Venn diagrams unveiled one common DEG for neuropsychiatric risk databases and CB<sub>1</sub>R expression manipulation, namely, the transcription factor ZBTB20. Prenatal knockdown of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs induced long-lasting behavioral alterations in the adult offspring of either sex, with an impairment of social interaction and motor behavior in siCB<sub>1</sub>R-derived adult mice. Taken together, these findings highlight the role of CB<sub>1</sub>Rs in controlling the development of pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and support the contribution of altered endocannabinoid signaling to neuropsychiatric vulnerability.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6CT) neurons project to both cortex and thalamus, inducing multiple effects including the modulation of cortical and thalamic firing, and the emergence of high gamma oscillations in the cortical local field potential (LFP). We hypothesize that the high gamma oscillations driven by L6CT neuron activation reflect the dynamic engagement of intracortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits. To test this, we optogenetically activated L6CT neurons in NTSR1-cre mice (both male and female) expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in L6CT neurons. Leveraging the vibrissal pathway in awake, head-fixed mice, we presented ramp-and-hold light at different intensities while recording neural activity in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) and the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPm) of the thalamus using silicon probes. We found that the activation of S1 L6CT neurons induces high-frequency LFP oscillations in S1 that are modulated in frequency, but not in amplitude, across light intensities and over time. To identify which neuronal classes contribute to these oscillations, we examined the temporal evolution of firing rate in S1 and VPm. While most S1 neurons were steadily suppressed, VPm and S1 layer 4 fast spiking (L4 FS) neurons evolved from being suppressed to facilitated within 500&nbsp;ms, suggesting differential recruitment of the intracortical versus cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. Finally, we found that LFP frequency selectively correlates with VPm firing rate. Taken together, our data suggests that L6CT neurons sculpt the frequency of S1 LFP oscillations through cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits, linking the recurrent interactions mediated by L6CT neurons to the high gamma oscillations observed across physiological and pathological conditions.</p>",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "content": "Mammals and reptiles possess a sophisticated somatosensory system for precise tactile discrimination via mechanosensory end-organs, such as Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles and others. These structures detect sustained pressure, velocity, and vibrations, thereby facilitating nuanced environmental interactions. It is not known whether the ancestral anamniotic somatosensory system, typically lacking such structures, provides comparable tactile discrimination. Here, we investigate the...",

      "title": "Nightmare disorder in women.",
      "content": "The aim of this study is to identify the short-term proximate triggers and effects of nightmares in adult women. In total, 85 females and 29 males participated in a 2-week intensive longitudinal assessment of mood, stress, social conflict, and sleep architecture measures. Sleep architecture was monitored with the DREEM\u20133 Headband device. Multilevel modeling analyses were conducted with lagged and cross-lagged effects estimates. Although women reported greater regular dream recall rates than men (9.76 women and 7.93 men), they reported the same number of nightmares as men (1.48 women and 1.48 men). Women displayed elevated percentage of light sleep in association with regular dreams, disturbing dreams, and nightmares and lesser amounts of percentage of deep sleep (N3%) for all three dream types. Z score conversions for N3% demonstrated a more dramatic reduction in N3% for females versus males on nights with disturbing dreams/nightmares. Female participants had significantly higher wake after sleep onset compared to males, with an estimated increase relative to men of 18.012 min (SE = 6.313, p = .006). An increase in stress 4 days prior to a nightmare significantly predicted that nightmare (estimate = 0.188, p = .020). Gender strongly mediated the effect of stress leading to a future nightmare. The interaction between gender and nightmares was positive and significant (p = .0015), with 23.9 more minutes awake after sleep onset than males 3 days after a nightmare occurrence. Women with nightmares may be disproportionately sleep deprived relative to male counterparts. Stress and insomnia precede the nightmare and insomnia follows. Such sleep deprivation contributes to a cycle where nightmare-related sleep-avoidant behavior leads to insomnia and build-up over time of a significant sleep debt.

      "content": "The aim of this study was to assess whether participants who present more frequently with nightmares or distressing dreams have had traumatic experiences in their childhood and their relationship with current personality traits. Three instruments were administered to a sample of 446 adults from the Argentine population: the Dreams Questionnaire, Negative Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, and an abbreviated version of the Symptoms Assessment. The results showed that participants presented specific dream content, such as hearing voices/music in dreams (88%), lucid dreams (79%), night terrors (64%), evil/demonic presences (61%), and dreams about a traumatic events (40%). The results also showed a correlation between the frequency of dream experiences and parental maltreatment (emotional, sexual, and physical abuse) and a positive and significant correlation between dream recall with propensity for mental health vulnerability symptoms, which confirmed the two main hypotheses. In addition, a gender difference showed that males tended to have greater dream recall compared to females, and females tended to show predominantly more auditory dreams and night terrors compared to males.

      "content": "We present Multiarrangement, an offline, open-source Python toolkit for collecting human similarity judgments for video stimuli through multi-arrangement tasks. Participants arrange subsets of stimuli in a 2D arena such that Euclidean distances reflect perceived dissimilarity. The toolkit supports two experiment paradigms: a set-cover scheduling system that uses combinatorial cover designs to guarantee pair coverage with minimal trials, aiming to avoid overwhelming the participant for stimulus-rich settings, and an adaptive Lift-the-Weakest scheduling that focuses each new trial on the globally least certain pair and informative neighbors. Across trials, partial distance evidence is integrated into a representational dissimilarity matrix using normalized weighted averaging, with an optional inverse MDS refinement that minimizes cross-trial prediction error. We document task design, algorithms, evaluations, and provide practical guidance for easy and reliable usage",
