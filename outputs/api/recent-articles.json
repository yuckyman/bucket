      "title": "Human basal radial glia morphotypes are transcriptionally distinct and exhibit different cell fate determination",
      "content": "Basal radial glia (bRG) are key neural progenitors driving human neocortical expansion. They exhibit remarkable morphological heterogeneity, yet the stability and functional significance of their distinct morphotypes remains unclear. Using human cortical brain organoids combined with long-term live imaging and morphology-resolved spatial transcriptomics (CellShape-seq), we show that bRG morphotypes display distinct morphodynamic behaviors, proliferative capacities and transcriptional profiles. While bifurcated bRG remodel extensively during mitosis to produce morphologically diverse progeny, multipolar cells are most morphologically flexible during interphase. Multipolar bRG further show the greatest proliferative capacity and the transcriptional signature related to progenitor state. Bifurcated bRG are least proliferative and are enriched for the multifunctional gene expression regulator YBX1. Pharmacological inhibition of YBX1 depletes bifurcated bRG, reduces neurogenesis, and promotes glial commitment. Our findings link progenitor morphology, gene expression and fate, providing a framework for understanding the cellular logic of human cortical development.",

      "title": "Deeper neuronal and glial proteomic insights using an optimized pipeline for proximity labeling proteomics",
      "content": "Proximity-based proteomics using TurboID has enabled cell-type specific profiling without the need for cell purification, although major bottlenecks in sample lysis, biotinylated protein enrichment, digestion, and mass spectrometry (MS) parameters have limited depth of proteome coverage. Here, we systematically optimized these variables using TurboID based labeling of BV2 microglia in vitro and brain astrocytes in vivo to define conditions that maximize proteome coverage. In microglia, the optimized protocol using 8 M urea lysis with on-bead S-Trap digestion and data-independent acquisition MS (DIA-MS) identified 4,016 proteins, double the depth of prior studies, and revealed metabolic, ribosomal, lipid-processing, autophagy, and trafficking signatures. Brain astrocyte proteomes were best recovered using SDS lysis with S-Trap digestion and DIA-MS, yielding a proteome of over 3,600 highly enriched proteins, twice the depth of prior astrocyte-TurboID studies. The expanded astrocyte proteomes captured canonical astrocyte markers as well as membrane-associated, vesicular trafficking, and presynaptic protein signatures, consistent with labeling of astrocyte neuron interface regions, including proteins involved in receptor signaling, lipid metabolism, and plasticity at tripartite synapses, and several AD risk proteins. The increased peptide recovery following S-Trap digestion allowed the reduction of starting material to 20 ug protein for DIA-MS, and enabled multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT-MS) proteomics using even smaller samples. When applied to synaptosomes enriched from mouse brains with neuronal TurboID labeling, our pipeline identified a synapse-specific proteome of 2,529 proteins, revealing synaptic, mitochondrial and disease-relevant signatures not detectable in prior studies. By tackling critical bottlenecks from tissue processing to MS, our optimized pipelines enable cell-type and compartment-specific proximity-labeling proteomics to obtain comprehensive biological and disease-relevant insights across various biological fields.",

      "title": "Divergent co-transmission by a predictive motor circuit modulates auditory processing.",
      "content": "During behavior, an animals' movements often stimulate its own sensory receptors. For instance, whether during flight or the production of courtship song, when flies beat their wings they cause mechanosensory disturbances that activate primary auditory neurons in the antennae. However, flight and courtship occur under very different behavioral contexts and temporal-scales. As a consequence, the nervous system contains predictive motor circuits that modify sensory processing in anticipation of self-induced (re-afferent) stimulation. However, it is unclear how information about planned movements can be used to effectively tune specialized sensory processing circuits. Here we describe a predictive motor circuit that releases two transmitters to differentially modify auditory neurons that process sound under different behavioral contexts. In Drosophila, two metathoracic ascending histamine neurons (MtAHNs) become active prior to wing movement and project to the primary auditory network. We found that the MtAHNs co-transmit the neuropeptide Dh44 and histamine, and each suppresses the activity of auditory neurons that are integrated into distinct networks that support escape and courtship, respectively. Additionally, Dh44 has a greater impact on male auditory neurons and suppression by Dh44 occurs over a longer time course than histamine. Disrupting either histamine synthesis or neuropeptide release by the MtAHNs reduces courtship success with an increase in cessation during the wing extension step. Consistent with a role in auditory processing of courtship cues, Dh44 cotransmission is present in Drosophila species that have an auditory component to their courtship displays, but is absent in species that use either purely visual courtship or lack apparent courtship behavior. Finally, the projections of the MtAHNs into auditory centers were missing in snow flies, which are wingless. Our results indicate that divergent cotransmission by predictive motor circuits may represent an efficient means to differentially modulate sensory subnetworks impacted by reafferent feedback.",

      "title": "Comparative effects of inactivation and dopamine receptor agents in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum on performance of action sequences in rats",
      "content": "Rationale: Recent research on habits and skills has produced a wave of new theories regarding the shift in control from medial to lateral regions of the dorsal striatum, and how these regions are implicated in the selected and executed of action sequences. Objectives: To examine the comparative effects of muscimol/baclofen inactivation and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agents in the dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum on the performance of skilled action sequences. Methods: Infusions were made in well-trained rats using the five-step nose poke task to isolate the effects on initiation, execution and termination components of skilled action sequences. Results: DLS inactivation produced sequencing deficits like those observed with pre-training lesions, indicating that the DLS is critical for both the acquisition and performance of sequences. Behaviour was unchanged following DMS inactivation, consistent with models of DMS disengagement following training. Infusions of D1 and D2 antagonists did not alter behaviour, however the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole increased sequence errors at a low dose and reduced sequences at the high dose in the DLS. DLS manipulations impaired sequence initiation and termination as well as reward transitions, while the 'chunking' ballistic response pattern was largely unaltered, indicating that between- but not within-sequence actions rely on the DLS. Conclusions: Skilled action sequencing, including 'chunk' transitions was dependent on DLS and its modulation by D2 receptors, but not on DMS function. Using a novel sequencing task, these results support the dissociable and dopamine-dependent role of the dorsal striatum subregions in performing skilled motor actions.",

      "title": "Unique and overlapping behavioral effects of isoform-specific NRXN1 deletions across development",
      "content": "Mutations in the human neurexin 1 (NRXN1) gene are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism. Vertebrate NRXN1 produces three major NRXN1 isoforms, named , {beta}, and {gamma}. Human genetic data suggests that deletions located at the 5' region of the gene disrupting the  isoform associate mostly with clinical behavioral deficits. Yet, 3' deletions that disrupt multiple isoforms have also been identified in clinical cases. Whether deletions that selectively affect specific NRXN1 isoforms result in specific behavioral deficits remains unclear. Here, we show that zebrafish harboring gene deletions that differentially encompass nrxn1a-, -{beta}, and/or -{gamma} display both unique and overlapping locomotion, sensorimotor behavior, and social behavior deficits. Combined, our results strongly support a model by which domain selective nrxn1 deletions predict behavioral phenotypes. Moreover, our results demonstrate compelling relationships between genotype and resulting behavioral phenotypes, providing functional insights into the complexity of NRXN1-associated neuropsychiatric behaviors.",

      "title": "Serial Dependence operates on categorical rather than physical representations: evidence from behavior and EEG",
      "content": "Our environment is constantly changing but our perception is stable. This stability may result from the integration of successive visual images that smooths over spurious variations in input. Such a process manifests in a behavioral phenomenon called Serial Dependence (SD), an attractive bias between successive stimuli. Here we questioned whether SD originates from physical stimulus representations or at a higher level, that of categorical perception. We constructed face morphs from three prototypes of the same face expressing anger, fear and sadness. We measured the perceived similarity between each pair of morphs with an odd-one-out experiment, to build a behavioral representational similarity matrix. Emotional expressions were perceived categorically. Subjects then reproduced the perceived facial expression of successively presented morphs by adjusting a response cue while their cerebral activity was recorded with EEG. We showed attractive serial dependence tuned to perceptual distance rather than physical similarity. We used representational similarity analysis to discover the geometry of the mental representation of faces, to capture both the information represented in a neural signal and its format. EEG representational similarity analyses showed that neural responses encoded emotional ambiguity rather than category membership, with near-prototypical faces eliciting similar patterns across emotions. Models combining feature tuning with categorical structure best accounted for behavioral biases. Neural signals also carried traces of past stimuli. Stimuli for which memory-based representations diverged most from sensory representations showed the strongest attractive serial dependence.",

Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "Dynamic mode decomposition of resting-state fMRI revealing abnormal brain region features in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Measurement effects on critical scaling in neural systems",
      "content": "The recently developed phenomenological renormalization group (pRG) analysis has uncovered scale-free properties in large-scale neural population recordings across recording modalities, including extracellular electrophysiology and calcium imaging. The convergence of these properties across the datasets hints at universal neural behavior. Yet, it is unknown how differences in temporal resolution and measurement details affect pRG scaling. Here, we use a network model known to produce scaling under pRG analysis as a testbed to assess how recording and analysis choices shape inferred scaling exponents. We show that scaling properties depend on the choices of temporal binning, measurement nonlinearities, and deconvolution, and that the quality of scaling for cluster covariance eigenvalues is particularly sensitive to measurement effects. Moreover, all scaling exponents shift substantially with these transformations, even when the underlying neural dynamics are identical. Together, these results show how experimental choices can change pRG scaling and provide a framework for separating scaling driven by neural dynamics from that introduced by the recording method.",

      "content": "Serotonin is thought to regulate emotional learning and memory, but there remains much to be explored regarding its causal role in cued fear conditioning and extinction (CFC-E). Recent in vivo recording of dorsal raphe nucleus serotonin neuronal activity during CFC-E paradigm showed that the time course of serotonin level includes both rapid responses to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli and a slowly accumulating component that spans inter-trial intervals and reverses during extinction. By reviewing the studies that directly link the fear expression during CFC-E to the acute or chronic perturbations of serotonin dynamics at the organism level or within specific brain areas via pharmacological, genetic, and projection-specific manipulations, we argue that theoretical models defining the causal role of serotonin must incorporate continuous-time serotonin dynamics.",

It's essentially &quot;time travel debugging&quot; for Python backends, allowing you to capture a production error and step through it on your local machine.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Python backend developers (FastAPI, Django, Flask, Starlette) who want to debug complex production issues locally without setting up full staging environments, or who want to generate regression tests from real traffic.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> most tools either <em>monitor</em> traffic (OpenTelemetry, Datadog) or <em>mock</em> it for tests (VCR.py). TimeTracer captures production traffic and turns it into local, replayable test cases. Unlike VCR.py, it captures the <em>incoming</em> request context too, not just outgoing calls, making it a full-system replay tool.</p> <p><strong>What's New in v1.6</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Starlette Support:</strong> Full compatibility with Starlette applications (and by extension FastAPI).</li> <li><strong>Deep Dependency Tracking:</strong> The new dashboard visualizes the exact chain of dependency calls (e.g., your API -&gt; GitHub API -&gt; Database) for every request.</li> <li><strong>New Tutorial:</strong> I've written a guide on debugging 404 errors using this workflow (link in comments).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Source Code</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/usv240/timetracer\">https://github.com/usv240/timetracer</a></p> <p><strong>Installation</strong> </p> <pre><code>pip install timetracer </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/usv240\"> /u/usv240 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qkjcns/timetracer_v16_update_record_replay_debugging_now/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qkjcns/timetracer_v16_update_record_replay_debugging_now/\">[comments]</a></span>",
