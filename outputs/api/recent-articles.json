      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

      "title": "Phase precession of spindle-slow oscillation coupling across the human brain",
      "content": "Spindles and slow oscillations (SO) are fundamental elements of the NREM sleep microarchitecture, often co-occurring in a phase-dependent manner, and this cross-frequency coupling is critical for the temporal coordination of neural activity in sleep. However, spindles and SO occur at different times in different regions, and it is unclear how the coupling of these oscillations is organized across the brain. Here, we provide evidence in humans for a novel spatiotemporal organization of spindle-SO coupling, characterized by a precession of the SO phase of spindles along the brain's anterior-posterior axis. We show that this phase precession relationship is a robust phenomenon and can be quantified across individual subjects. Moreover, the integrity of phase precession strength and slope declines with advancing age. These findings provide new insight into the temporal coordination of sleep rhythms across brain space, linking this coordination to a canonical principle of neural coding.",

      "title": "The fluctuation-based regime of thalamocortical circuitry",
      "content": "Neocortical neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) integrate excitatory inputs from both thalamic and cortical sources to generate selectivity for orientation, direction and disparity. Feedforward models have posited that thalamocortical input can drive these selectivities, but the relative sparsity of thalamic synapses raises questions about the sufficiency of this input. To determine whether thalamic drive is sufficient to evoke cortical responses, we quantified the current threshold required to evoke action potentials in vivo using whole-cell recordings in mouse V1. We then isolated thalamic input via optogenetic cortical silencing and compared its strength to the measured spiking threshold. We find that although average thalamic input is below the threshold for action potential generation, trial-by-trial fluctuations in thalamic drive are sufficient to evoke visually driven action potentials. These results demonstrate that thalamic excitation alone can drive cortical spiking, but its effectiveness depends on fluctuations in synaptic input.",

      "title": "\"Awe-scillations\": EEG spectral and complexity representations of awe",
      "content": "Awe is a positive emotion often accompanied by sensations of vastness and unity, with known benefits for well-being and social behavior. However, its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. We recorded EEG and autonomic physiology in 23 healthy older participants while they watched a nature-based audiovisual film, The Nature Journey, and subjective ratings of awe were recorded. Awe was associated with decreased alpha and theta spectral power, and increased Lempel Ziv complexity (LZC) - indicating heightened neural signal entropy and increased information processing. These effects partially converged across datasets and awe induction methods, supporting their generalizability. Notably, awe-related increases in LZC correlated with reduced sympathetic activity and greater self-reported awe intensity, but not self-reported joy, suggesting some level of specificity. These results suggest that awe evokes distinctive neurophysiological states linked to both autonomic changes and subjective experience.",

      "title": "Autism-like behavior induced by conditional ablation of the Bassoon gene in GABAergic interneurons",
      "content": "Synaptic dysfunction and resulting imbalance of excitatory vs. inhibitory transmission are fundamental aspects of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here we addressed the role of inhibitory synapse disturbances in ASD employing mice with a conditional ablation in inhibitory forebrain interneurons of the presynaptic active zone scaffolding protein Bassoon (Bsn), a key factor in synaptic development, activity and maintenance. The conditional Bsn gene knock out resulted in a reduction of synaptic vesicles and reduced synaptic efficacy of affected inhibitory synapses as well as diminished GABAergic inhibition in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Bsn mutants further displayed a reconfiguration of the hippocampal synaptic network in vivo, as seen in subfield-specific changes of inhibitory synaptic markers and reduced numbers of parvalbumin interneurons, culminating in disturbance of hippocampal network activity patterns and profound mitochondrial and metabolic dysregulation. Importantly, the mutant mice developed behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of ASD including widespread social behavioral deficits and novelty-induced hyperarousal with altered motor behavior, increased anxiety and epileptiform activity. Bsn conditional knock out mice thus provide strong evidence for a causal involvement of GABAergic synapses in the emergence of ASD-related behavioral and physiological phenotypes.",

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

It\u2019s meant for pair programming, tutoring, or just coding Python together. It\u2019s completely free. No subscriptions, no ads, nothing. Just create an account, make a group, and start a project. Has proper code-linting, extremely intuitive UI, autosaving, drawing features (you can draw directly onto the IDE and scroll), live selections, and voice/live chats per project. There are no limitations at the moment (except for code size to prevent malicious payloads). There is also built-in support for libraries like matplotlib.</p> <p>Source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/SJRiz/pytogether\">https://github.com/SJRiz/pytogether</a></p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>It\u2019s designed for tutors, educators, or Python beginners.</p> <h1>Comparison With Existing Alternatives</h1> <p>Why build this when Replit or VS Code Live Share already exist?</p> <p>Because my goal was simplicity and education. I wanted something lightweight for beginners who just want to write and share simple Python scripts (alone or with others), without downloads, paywalls, or extra noise. There\u2019s also no AI/copilot built in, something many teachers and learners actually prefer. I also focused on a communication-first approach, where the IDE is the &quot;focus&quot; of communication (hence why I added tools like drawing, voice/live chats, etc).</p> <h1>Project Information</h1> <p>Tech stack (frontend):</p> <p>React + TailwindCSS</p> <p>CodeMirror for linting</p> <p>Y.js for real-time syncing and live cursors</p> <p>I use Pyodide for Python execution directly in the browser, this means you can actually use advanced libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib while staying fully client-side and sandboxed for safety.</p> <p>I don\u2019t enjoy frontend or UI design much, so I leaned on AI for some design help, but all the logic/code is mine. Deployed via Vercel.</p> <p>Tech stack (backend):</p> <p>Django (channels, auth, celery/redis support made it a great fit, though I plan to replace the celery worker with Go later so it'll be faster)</p> <p>PostgreSQL via Supabase</p> <p>JWT + OAuth authentication</p> <p>Redis for channel layers + caching</p> <p>Fully Dockerized + deployed on a VPS (8GB RAM, $7/mo deal)</p> <p>Data models:</p> <p>Users &lt;-&gt; Groups -&gt; Projects -&gt; Code</p> <p>Users can join many groups</p> <p>Groups can have multiple projects</p> <p>Each project belongs to one group and has one code file (kept simple for beginners, though I may add a file system later).</p> <p>My biggest technical challenges were around performance and browser execution. One major hurdle was getting Pyodide to work smoothly in a real-time collaborative setup. I had to run it inside a Web Worker to handle synchronous I/O (since input() is blocking), though I was able to find a library that helped me do this more efficiently (pyodide-worker-runner). This let me support live input/output and plotting in the browser without freezing the UI, while still allowing multiple users to interact with the same Python session collaboratively.</p> <p>Another big challenge was designing a reliable and efficient autosave system. I couldn\u2019t just save on every keystroke as that would hammer the database. So I designed a Redis-based caching layer that tracks active projects in memory, and a Celery worker that loops through them every minute to persist changes to the database. When all users leave a project, it saves and clears from cache. This setup also doubles as my channel layer for real-time updates and my Celery broker; reusing Redis for everything while keeping things fast and scalable.</p> <p>Deployment on a VPS was another beast. I spent ~8 hours wrangling Nginx, Certbot, Docker, and GitHub Actions to get everything up and running. It was frustrating, but I learned a lot.</p> <p>If you\u2019re curious or if you wanna see the work yourself, the source code is here.
