      "title": "Serum neurofilament light chain predicts stroke outcome and is a potential marker for treatment effects of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles in a rat stroke model",
      "content": "Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, and effective treatments are urgently needed beyond reperfusion therapy. Translating preclinical success to clinical impact has been hindered by variability in animal models and the lack of translational biomarkers that predict outcomes across species. To overcome these barriers, we developed a robust rat AIS model optimized for consistency and severity, enabling rigorous therapeutic testing. Additionally, we tested a panel of common clinical serum biomarkers to improve translation from rodents to humans. We demonstrated that serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) -a biomarker widely used in clinical stroke studies- strongly correlated with functional outcomes, establishing a translational link that has not been previously reported in rats. Notably, the predictive capability of NfL outperformed infarct volume, a key prognostic factor in moderate and severe strokes, as well as traditional serum biomarkers intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and S100 calcium binding protein (S100B). Using this platform, we evaluated the therapeutic impact of neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC EVs), a novel biologic therapy poised for clinical trials, on stroke outcome in our rat AIS model. A three-dose regimen of NSC EV over 48 hours produced the best outcomes in stroked animals evidenced by smaller infarct volume, improved neurologic score, and reduced serum NfL, although single-dose and two-dose regimens were both effective at some endpoints. These findings not only validate NfL as a cross-species biomarker but also provide critical dosing insights for NSC EV therapy, accelerating the path from bench to bedside for AIS treatment.",

      "title": "pip-weigh: A CLI tool to check the disk size of Python packages including their dependencies.",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h2>What My Project Does</h2> <p>pip-weigh is a command-line tool that tells you exactly how much disk space a Python package and all its dependencies will consume before you install it. I was working with some agentic frameworks and realized that most of them felt too bloated, and i thought i might compare them but when i searched online for a tool to do this, i realized that there is no such tool atm for this. There are some tools that actually check the size of the package itself but they dont calculate the size of dependencies that come with installing those packages. So i made a cli tool for this. Under the hood, it creates a temporary virtual environment using uv, installs the target package, parses the uv.lock file to get the full dependency tree, then calculates the actual size of each package by reading the .dist-info/RECORD files. This gives you the real &quot;logical size&quot; - what you'd actually see in a Docker image. <strong>Example output:</strong> ``` $ pip-weigh pandas \ud83d\udce6 pandas (2.1.4) \u251c\u2500\u2500 Total Size: 138 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 Self Size: 45 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 Platform: linux \u251c\u2500\u2500 Python: 3.12 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Dependencies (5): \u251c\u2500\u2500 numpy (1.26.2): 85 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 pytz (2023.3): 5 MB \u251c\u2500\u2500 python-dateutil (2.8.2): 3 MB \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...</p> <p>``<code> **Features:** - Budget checking:</code>pip-weigh pandas --budget 100MB<code>exits with code 1 if exceeded (useful for CI) - JSON output for scripting - Cross-platform: check Linux package sizes from Windows/Mac **Installation:**</code>pip install pip-weigh` (requires uv) <strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/muddassir-lateef/pip-weigh\">https://github.com/muddassir-lateef/pip-weigh</a></p> <h2>Target Audience</h2> <p>Developers who need to optimize Python deployments - particularly useful for: - Docker image optimization - AWS Lambda (250MB limit) - CI/CD pipelines to prevent dependency bloat It's a small side project but fully functional and published on PyPI.</p> <h2>Comparison</h2> <p>Existing tools only show size of the packages and don't calculate total sizes with dependencies. There's no easy way to check &quot;how big will this be?&quot;. pip-weigh differs by: - Calculating <strong>total size including all transitive dependencies</strong> - Using logical file sizes (what Docker sees) instead of disk usage (which can be misleading due to uv's hardlinks) I'd love feedback or suggestions for features. I am thinking of adding a <code>--compare</code> flag to show size differences between package versions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Character-Being2523\"> /u/Character-Being2523 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpxwk1/pipweigh_a_cli_tool_to_check_the_disk_size_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpxwk1/pipweigh_a_cli_tool_to_check_the_disk_size_of/\">[comments]</a></span>",
