      "title": "Precision neurodiversity: personalized brain network architecture as a window into cognitive variability",
      "content": "Precision neurodiversity marks a shift in neuroscience from pathological models to personalized frameworks that view neurological differences as adaptive variations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the Personalized Brain Network architecture and its relationship with cognitive variability in both typical and neurodiverse populations. The study examines advancements in connectome-based prediction modeling, normative modeling, dynamic fingerprinting, and machine learning methods that characterize individual-specific neural networks. Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria. However, research has revealed significant network-level differences among these subgroups. Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities. However, successful translation requires overcoming challenges related to statistical power, reproducibility, ethical implementation and community participation. The convergence of advanced neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, and personalized medicine offers unprecedented opportunities for tailored interventions, while celebrating neurological diversity as a source of human strength.",

      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "content": "BackgroundWhite matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), associated with cognitive decline and stroke risk. An accurate predictive model is needed for early risk assessment.MethodsThis retrospective study utilized data from 587 patients undergoing cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at Hebei University\u2019s Neurology Department. A predictive model for WMH was developed using a combination of clinical and laboratory parameters through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and binary logistic regression analysis. The model\u2019s performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsKey predictors included age, history of stroke, hypertension, triiodothyronine levels, albumin- globulin ratio, and homocysteine. The nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.783 (95% CI: 0.738\u20130.829) in the training cohort and 0.762 (95% CI: 0.690\u20130.834) in the validation cohort. Calibration and DCA confirmed the model\u2019s clinical applicability.ConclusionThis study presents a validated nomogram for predicting WMH, integrating clinical and biochemical markers. The model demonstrated robust predictive accuracy and potential for early risk stratification. Future studies should focus on multi-center validation and expanded risk factor inclusion.",

      "title": "Are emojis better? The impact of generative AI emoji cues and service outcomes on user satisfaction: evidence from ERPs",
      "content": "To promote the sustainable development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applications in the service industry, enhancing user satisfaction is key. Emojis serve as catalysts for conveying emotions and enhancing user experience in online communication. However, due to the black-box nature and unpredictability of GenAI, service providers find it challenging to control the boundaries of their application. Currently, there is ongoing debate within the academic community regarding the use of emojis in GenAI, particularly concerning emotional manipulation and experience enhancement, with further exploration needed into their effectiveness and underlying mechanisms. This study is based on the emotion as social information model and employs event-related potential (ERP) technology with high temporal resolution, which is more suitable for GenAI interaction scenarios. By measuring users\u2019 immediate cognitive processing and psychological activities, the study analyzes the underlying cognitive neural mechanisms through which emojis (presence vs. absence) and service outcomes (success vs. failure) influence user satisfaction. Behavioral results indicate that the outcome of GenAI services determines user satisfaction, while the presence or absence of emojis does not directly impact satisfaction. ERP results show that the presence of emojis compared to their absence triggers larger P3 amplitudes (emotional arousal) and N4 amplitudes (cognitive conflict); compared to service success, the presence of emojis during service failure triggers larger N4 amplitudes. This study reveals the complexity of user responses in real human-machine interaction environments, enriches research on the use of Emojis in GenAI, and provides scientific theoretical and practical foundations for GenAI design and enhancing user experience.",

      "title": "Case Report: Compound heterozygous KCTD7 variants in two siblings presenting with myoclonic epilepsy and ataxia",
      "content": "ObjectiveBiallelic variants in KCTD7 have been associated with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by early-onset epilepsy, cognitive decline, myoclonus, and ataxia.MethodsWhole-exome sequencing was first performed in the elder sister to identify candidate variants, followed by in silico pathogenicity prediction. Sanger sequencing was then used to validate the variants in both parents and the younger brother.ResultsWe report two siblings with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME) carrying compound heterozygous KCTD7 variants: c.334C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg112Cys), a paternally inherited variant previously reported in homozygous form and currently classified as likely pathogenic, and c.640C\u202f>\u202fT (p.Arg214Trp), a novel maternally inherited variant currently classified as of uncertain significance. Both patients presented between 2 and 3\u202fyears of age with gait instability, myoclonic seizures, and developmental regression. EEG revealed background slowing, multifocal spike\u2013slow wave discharges, and electrical status epilepticus during sleep. Brain MRI findings were initially unremarkable despite progressive neurological deterioration. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger validation confirmed the variants and their segregation. In silico tools predicted both variants to be deleterious, and structural modeling using PyMOL and I-Mutant 3.0 demonstrated that both variants likely disrupt local residue interactions and reduce protein stability. Both patients received antiepileptic therapy and immunomodulatory treatment, including intravenous methylprednisolone and immunoglobulin. The proband achieved seizure control and improved gait following immunotherapy, though cognitive deficits persisted. The younger sibling exhibited a more severe disease course, with progressive cognitive decline, speech and visual impairment, and loss of independent ambulation, despite partial seizure control. These findings expand the genetic and phenotypic spectrum of KCTD7-related PME and suggest that immunotherapy may confer partial clinical benefit in selected cases.ConclusionThis case expands the variant spectrum of KCTD7-related disorders and emphasizes the utility of comprehensive genetic testing in early-onset neurodegenerative epileptic syndromes. Functional studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of the novel KCTD7 variant.",

      "title": "Multimodal neuroimaging of Col4a1-mutant mouse models of Gould syndrome",
      "content": "IntroductionCerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a leading cause of stroke and vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Studying monogenic forms of cSVD can elucidate molecular pathways that are dysfunctional in the common sporadic forms and may serve as potential therapeutic targets. Mutations in COL4A1 and COL4A2 cause highly penetrant cSVD as part of the multisystem disorder known as Gould syndrome, which includes cerebrovascular manifestations such as porencephaly, early-onset stroke, leukoencephalopathy, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).MethodsTo investigate how allelic heterogeneity influences cerebrovascular phenotypes, we examined five Col4a1 mutant mouse strains that collectively model the clinical spectrum of Gould syndrome. Each strain underwent multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 14.1 Tesla to assess radiological features characteristic of cSVD.ResultsMultimodal MRI successfully identified typical cSVD-associated lesions across all Col4a1 mutant strains. The imaging revealed heterogeneous expressivity among the allelic variants in terms of lesion prevalence, size, and number. Furthermore, analysis across strains identified brain regions that were consistently more vulnerable to cSVD-related lesions.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that high-field multimodal MRI can sensitively detect and differentiate cerebrovascular abnormalities among Col4a1 mutant mouse models of Gould syndrome. The approach provides a powerful, noninvasive platform for assessing genotype\u2013phenotype relationships and for identifying brain regions at heightened risk in cSVD, supporting its potential use in early diagnosis and mechanistic studies of vascular pathology.",

      "title": "High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2504.13727v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive novel, precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.",

      "title": "Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.08436v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.08531v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The slime mould Physarum polycephalum displays adaptive transport dynamics and network formation that have inspired its use as a model of biological computation. We develop a Lagrangian formulation of Physarum's adaptive dynamics on predefined graphs, showing that steady states arise as extrema of a least-action functional balancing metabolic dissipation and transport efficiency. The organism's apparent ability to find optimal paths between nutrient sources and sinks emerges from minimizing global energy dissipation under predefined boundary conditions that specify the problem to be solved. Applied to ring, tree, and lattice geometries, the framework accurately reproduces the optimal conductance and flux configurations observed experimentally. These results show that Physarum's problem-solving on constrained topologies follows a physics-based variational principle, revealing least-action dynamics as the foundation of its adaptive organization.",

      "title": "Distance by de-correlation: Computing distance with heterogeneous grid cells",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.08292v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Encoding the distance between locations in space is essential for accurate navigation. Grid cells, a functional class of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex, are believed to support this computation. However, existing theories of how populations of grid cells code distance rely on complex coding schemes, with assumptions that may not be met by anatomical constraints. Inspired by recent work finding grid cells to have small, but robust heterogeneity in their grid properties, we hypothesize that distance coding can be achieved by a simple de-correlation of population activity. We develop a mathematical theory for describing this de-correlation in one-dimension, showing that its predictions are consistent with simulations of noisy grid cells. Our simulations highlight a non-intuitive prediction of such a distance by de-correlation framework. Namely, that some further distances are better encoded than some nearer distances. We find evidence of this \"sweet spot\" in previously published rodent behavioral experiments and demonstrate that a decoder which estimates distance from the de-correlation of populations of simulated noisy grid cells leads to a similar pattern of errors. Finally, by simulating noisy grid cells in two-dimensions, we find that there exists a trade-off between the range of distances that can be encoded by de-correlation of population activity and the distinguishability of different distances, which is controlled by the amount of variability in grid properties. We show that the previously observed average amount of grid property variability strikes a balance between the two, enabling the encoding of distances up to several meters. Our work provides new insight on how grid cells can underlie the coding of distance, without the assumptions previously needed, and why grid cells may have small amounts of heterogeneity in their grid properties.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.08101v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper gives an in-depth theoretical analysis of the direction and speed selectivity properties of idealized models of the spatio-temporal receptive fields of simple cells and complex cells, based on the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields. According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.\n  By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are qualitatively consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii)~different visual neurons having broader {\\em vs.\\/}\\ sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.",

      "title": "Advancing credibility and transparency in brain-to-image reconstruction research: Reanalysis of Koide-Majima, Nishimoto, and Majima (Neural Networks, 2024)",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.07960v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A recent high-profile study by Koide-Majima et al. (2024) claimed a major advance in reconstructing visual imagery from brain activity using a novel variant of a generative AI-based method. However, our independent reanalysis reveals multiple methodological concerns that raise questions about the validity of their conclusions. Specifically, our evaluation demonstrates that: (1) the reconstruction results are biased by selective reporting of only the best-performing examples at multiple levels; (2) performance is artificially inflated by circular metrics that fail to reflect perceptual accuracy; (3) fair baseline comparisons reveal no discernible advantages of the study's key innovations over existing techniques; (4) the central \"Bayesian\" sampling component is functionally inert, producing outcomes identical to the standard optimization result; and (5) even if the component were successfully implemented, the claims of Bayesian novelty are unsubstantiated, as the proposed method does not leverage the principles of a proper Bayesian framework. These systemic issues necessitate a critical reassessment of the study's contributions. This commentary dissects these deficiencies to underscore the need for greater credibility and transparency in the rapidly advancing field of brain decoding.",
