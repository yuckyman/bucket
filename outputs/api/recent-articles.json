      "title": "Using time-resolved auditory frequency tagging to capture self-preferential processing of the own (vs other) name",
      "content": "The own name is an important, salient self-related stimulus and ostensive cue. Prioritized processing of ones own name plays a key role in attention, self-awareness, and social and cognitive development. Previous studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have reported a self-preferential effect for the own name, characterized by enhanced neural responses compared to the names of (close) others. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate an EEG auditory frequency-tagging task to measure self-preferential processing of the own name, leveraging the superior signal-to-noise ratio of this technique, which is highly relevant for future studies on infants and clinical populations. To this end, we ran two separate studies (dichotic: n1 = 31, non-dichotic: n2 = 32). In contrast to previous ERP research, we did not find evidence of a self-preferential effect. We reasoned that collapsing temporal information may have led to the failure to capture the effect, which ERP research has shown to emerge at a late stage of processing, and that this effect may have been overshadowed by early brain responses. To address this issue, we applied a novel approach that we refer to as the time-resolved frequency tagging approach, which incorporates knowledge of the effect in the temporal domain. This did result in a clear self-preferential effect of the own name. Hence, we were able to develop and validate an EEG frequency-tagging task to measure the self-preferential effect of the own name. Our approach can also be used in future EEG frequency-tagging studies investigating other complex cognitive processes.",

      "content": "We introduce the Simulated Environment for Neurocognitive State Evaluation (SENSE-42), a multimodal dataset collected during user interactions with desktop computers. It is designed for studying spontaneous fluctuations in the neurocognitive state related to the tonic alertness of computer users, with recordings from 42 participants over 2-hour sessions. Within a simulated desktop environment, participants performed real-world routine tasks, including application switching, file management, typing, and web browsing. High-resolution data were recorded across physiological (electroencephalography, electrocardiography, respiration) and subjective modalities of alertness. At five-minute intervals, alertness state was reported using seven questions, addressing sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), mental and temporal demand, perceived performance, effort and frustration (NASA Task Load Index), as well as attentiveness. Behavioural data included keyboard, mouse and webcam inputs. Demographic information for the experience, habits, and preferences of computer usage was collected. In addition, individual differences in sleep quality were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The SENSE-42 dataset can contribute to future research in user state monitoring, behavioural analysis and physiological computing.",

      "title": "Immersive NREM dreaming preserves subjective sleep depth against declining sleep pressure",
      "content": "Perceived sleep depth is a key determinant of subjective sleep quality, traditionally thought to reflect unconsciousness and reduced cortical activation. Here, we combined high-density EEG with a serial awakening paradigm during NREM sleep to examine its neural and experiential correlates. As expected, deeper sleep was associated with reduced cortical activation, reflected in a lower high-to-low frequency power ratio. Yet, this relationship weakened in the presence of dreaming, indicating that immersive conscious experiences can counteract the impact of cortical activation on perceived depth. Indeed, perceived sleep depth was lowest during states with a mere sense of presence and highest during immersive dreaming or deep unconsciousness. Across the night, physiological sleep pressure and subjective sleepiness declined, but perceived sleep depth rose alongside increasing dream immersiveness. These results challenge the view that deep sleep stems solely from reduced brain activity and suggest that immersive dreaming sustains perceived sleep depth as homeostatic pressure wanes.",

      "title": "NERV: A Comprehensive Framework for Rapid, Reproducible, and Hardware-Synchronized Neuroscience Experiment Design and Execution",
      "content": "Background: Behavioral neuroscience experiments require precise stimulus control, millisecond timing, hardware integration, and robust data provenance. Increasing use of 3D environments and multimodal recordings adds challenges for development, accessibility, and reproducibility. Fragmented tools often separate presentation, synchronization, and logging, leading to inefficiencies. New Method: The Neuroscience Experimental Runtime by Vanderbilt (NERV) is a Unity-based framework that unifies experiment design, execution, and data logging. It enables rapid, no-code prototyping by automating scene and script generation, event timing, state management, hardware-synchronized data acquisition, and archival of code and experimental configurations. The modular, open-source framework implements a \"low floor, high ceiling\" design that lowers barriers for non-programmers while remaining extensible for advanced customization. Results: Across 500 trials, Unity-to-TTL delay was 2.10 +/- 1.21 ms, TTL-to-photodiode delay was 28.93 +/- 0.76 ms, and Unity-to-screen delay was 31.04 +/- 1.41 ms. These results confirm stable millisecond precision and frame-locked timing, enabling reliable alignment of neural, behavioral, and visual events. Comparison with existing methods: Existing frameworks involve trade-offs. Some achieve precise timing but require advanced coding, while others improve accessibility but struggle with hardware or 3D graphics. Commercial platforms offer polish yet remain costly, closed-source, and inflexible. NERV combines millisecond precision, modular open-source design, and provenance in a single platform, reducing workflow fragmentation and enabling reproducible, scalable experiments. Conclusion: NERV is an accessible yet extensible framework that unites rapid development, robust data provenance, and millisecond precision. It accelerates development, ensures reproducibility, and establishes a scalable foundation for next-generation neuroscience research.",

      "title": "A Novel Mechanism for Tauopathy in Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: Excitotoxic Misplacement of a Mitochondrial Anchor into Dendrites Driven by Tau-hyperphosphorylation",
      "content": "On April 2nd, 2025, the FDA approved a Fast Track Designation for Biogen to use Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASO) to treat tauopathy in clinical trials for Alzheimer Disease (AD) to meet an unmet medical need [1]. For Multiple Sclerosis (MS), there is a similar unmet medical need regarding tauopathy when MS transitions into the late, or Progressive MS that is currently incurable. AD and MS share commonality: there is comorbidity between AD and MS [2], and the recent awareness that progressive MS may be considered a secondary tauopathy [3]. This study lays the basic science foundation for a future repurposing of ASO tauopathy therapy from AD to MS. The central hypothesis is that in Progressive MS, tauopathy is not a passive bystander but an active contributor to synaptic degeneration through a novel toxic target known as DSI (Dendritic Syntaphilin Intrusion) discovered in our laboratory. In this hypothesis, the excitotoxic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) GluN2B activates Tau hyperphosphorylation (p-Tau), leading to the mislocalization or intrusion of a mitochondrial anchor SNPH into neuronal dendrites (DSI). This causes mitochondrial damage and subsequent synapse/dendrite disintegration. In support of this hypothesis that tauopathy is a key driver of DSI, we demonstrated using primary neuronal cultures that inhibitors of p-Tau kinases and Tau-KO both completely abolish DSI. We propose that a therapy for Progressive MS is repurpose the existing FDA-approved ASO Tau knockdown therapy from AD to treat MS.",

      "title": "Distortion rules: audibility creation in the mosquito ear",
      "content": "Hearing begins when ears convert sound into neuronal excitation. The hearing organs of male Anopheles mosquitoes rank amongst the most sensitive ears evolved. Males use them to detect faint female flight tones within noisy mating swarms, but female flight tones largely lie above the male's hearing range. We report a mechanism by which inaudible higher-frequency primary tones become audible through intrinsically generated, lower-frequency distortion tones. Distortion-evoked responses show ~10-times greater sensitivity and 45% higher temporal precision than those of same-frequency primary tones. Moreover, self-sustained oscillations of the male's ear dramatically reshape auditory frequency tuning and neuronal recruitment. By one mechanism, mosquito ears thus create audible signals and isolate these from the most salient frequencies of background noise. In audiology, distortions are used for diagnostics; their biological relevance, however, is unknown. Our results suggest that distortions are not mere by-products of the auditory process, but integral to its signaling logic.",

      "title": "The enhancement of nodal properties in the dorsal visual pathway is associated with compensatory mechanisms of visuospatial cognitive abilities following total sleep deprivation",
      "content": "IntroductionVision is the most critical sensory perception in humans, however, total sleep deprivation (TSD) impairs visuospatial cognitive abilities. While evidence suggests that the brain actively counteracts the adverse effects of TSD to preserve visual cognition, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood.MethodsTo explore the compensatory mechanisms of TSD on visuospatial cognition, we collected resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 24 participants at baseline state (BS) and after 36 h of TSD, along with behavioral data from a mental rotation task. Graph theory-based analyses were employed to assess global and nodal network properties.ResultsBehaviorally, reaction time (RT) significantly increased under TSD compared to BS, indicating impaired spatial cognition. In contrast, accuracy (ACC) for mirrored 120\u00b0 trials significantly improved under TSD, suggesting that participants invested greater effort in more demanding tasks and adopted a strategy of prolonged RT to maintain ACC. EEG findings revealed a significant increase in the small-worldness index (sigma) after TSD, which positively correlated with the improvement in ACC for mirrored 120\u00b0 trials. Nodal properties in the dorsal visual pathway, particularly in parietal regions, were significantly enhanced following TSD. Similarly, nodal properties in the left middle frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus were significantly strengthened, and these enhancements were positively associated with the increase of ACC in mirrored 120\u00b0 trials.DiscussionThese results demonstrate that individuals compensate for TSD-induced visual cognitive deficits by enhancing small-world network property and information transfer efficiency in the dorsal visual pathway. Additionally, top-down control is mediated by the middle frontal gyrus, while bottom-up information integration is facilitated by the superior temporal gyrus.",

      "title": "Human cortical high-gamma power scales with movement rate in healthy participants and stroke survivors",
      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
