      "title": "Cross-brain transfer of high-performance intracortical speech and handwriting BCIs",
      "content": "Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode complex movements, such as handwriting and speech, can require substantial training data to achieve high performance. We investigated whether leveraging the neural activity recordings of previous users could reduce this initial data collection burden for new BCI users (an approach we call \"cross-brain transfer\"). Using intracortical recordings from five BrainGate2 clinical trial participants, we tested cross-brain transfer for both speech and handwriting neural decoders trained and evaluated on general, unconstrained corpora of spoken and written English. We found that cross-brain transfer improved decoding performance when training data from the target user was limited (< 200 sentences), and that dataset-specific input layers to the decoder were critical for combining data across users. Without trainable input layers, transfer failed and performed worse than training from scratch on target user data only. Finally, we measured the effectiveness of cross-brain transfer relative to training with (1) more data from the same user and (2) more electrode-permuted data from the same user, which simulates sampling from another brain with identical neural latent structure. In some cases (T16 speech, T12 handwriting), cross-brain transfer appeared as effective as additional permuted data from the same user, while in others (T12 speech, T15 speech) electrode-permuted data was more beneficial. Our results successfully demonstrate and characterize cross-brain transfer learning between multiple intracortical BCI users, for both speech and handwriting, using a general open-ended dataset not restricted to small sets of words or phrases. This work highlights a promising path towards addressing a key barrier to the clinical translation of BCIs, while clarifying when cross-brain transfer may be most beneficial and the decoder design choices needed to realize those gains.",

      "title": "Time Cells in the Human Brain Support Working Memory Maintenance",
      "content": "Working memory (WM), the active retention of information over short periods, is a fundamental cognitive function, yet its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In rodents, cue-selective \"time cells\" fire at specific timepoints after a WM memory cue, collectively forming sequences that encode cue-memory and elapsed time, providing a temporal code for maintaining information across time intervals. Whether similar dynamics support WM in the human brain is unknown. Here, we analyzed intracranial single-neuron recordings from medial frontal and medial temporal regions of patients performing a WM task. We found time cells with temporally tuned activation during WM maintenance, collectively forming robust sequences that tiled a delay period. Time-cell coordination in the hippocampus predicted successful WM maintenance, whereas in the pre-supplementary motor area it reflected memory load. Furthermore, we identified distributed cue-selective time cells that encoded both the identity of a memorandum and elapsed maintenance time, providing a temporally structured mnemonic code that complements persistent firing of concept cells. Together, these findings establish time-cell sequences as a conserved neural mechanism supporting human working memory.",
