      "title": "Neural Phoneme Processing in Children with and without Dyslexia",
      "content": "This study investigates the neural dynamics of phoneme processing in 7-year-old children with and without dyslexia (25;9 male), using EEG recordings collected during continuous speech listening. By applying temporal generalization to phonetic descriptor decoding, we can disentangle whether potential phoneme processing deficits are due to the maintenance of phonemes in verbal short-term memory and/or inferred differences in phonetic processing speed, both of which are thought to be impaired in dyslexia. We investigated whether phonetic processing depends on the phoneme's position or its lexical competition. Our results reveal two key findings that may help explain the challenges faced by children with dyslexia. First, these children exhibit reduced decoding accuracy for word-onset phonemes, suggesting disruptions in either predictive, word-level anticipatory mechanisms or in the intrinsic rhythmic processing aligned with word boundaries. Second, they exhibit increased decoding accuracy for non-onset phonemes with low lexical competition approximately 400 ms after phoneme onset. This pattern suggests that children with dyslexia retain linguistically less relevant sounds longer in verbal short-term memory and process them more slowly compared to their typical reading peers. Together, these findings suggest that dyslexia is characterized by altered phonetic encoding strategies, specifically inefficient prioritization of relevant phonological information. This work provides new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying phonological deficits and contributes to a deeper understanding of the cognitive basis of dyslexia.",

      "content": "Variables relevant to behavior and cognition are often synthesized via computations that combine external cues and internal states. Especially salient and ubiquitous among these variables are time, space, and reward, but how they are simultaneously represented throughout the neocortex and the entorhinal cortex is not well understood. Here, we devised a behavioral task in virtual reality that includes timing, navigation, and reward components and, using a multifocus microscope that permits simultaneous mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging of neocortex and entorhinal cortex, we uncover dedicated and distinct subnetworks for interval timing, spatial navigation, and reward. Interestingly, the timing subnetwork includes a strong contribution from barrel cortex, pointing towards a previously unknown role for this cortex in interval timing.",

      "title": "Hippocampal transformations occur along dimensions of memory interference",
      "content": "The role of the hippocampus in resolving memory interference has been greatly elucidated by considering the relationship between the similarity of visual stimuli (input) and corresponding similarity of hippocampal activity patterns (output). However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.",

      "content": "The genetic and spatial determinants of cell type diversity in human cerebral cortices remain poorly defined. Here, we present a population-level single-cell spatial transcriptomic atlas of human cortices from 71 donors across the lifespan. We identified 906 layer-specific genes showing conserved and divergent laminar expression patterns between humans and other species. Spatial analysis revealed neuronal vulnerability and glial activation during aging, together with a decline in the proportion of superficial SST neurons and their interactions with other cells. Disease-associated genes exhibited high cell-type and layer-specific expression, implicating the pathogenic role of spatially specific gene expression. Spatial cis-eQTL analysis identified regulatory variants linked to genes related to diseases like Tourette syndrome. Cross-species comparison demonstrated glial expansion in the human cortex, accompanied by enhanced neuron-glia communication via the neuregulin signaling. Together, we provide a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the human cortex that is essential for understanding aging, evolution, and disease pathogenesis.",

      "content": "Within the framework of a \u201cneurofilmological\u201d approach \u2013 which integrates film studies, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience \u2013 the present study explored how cinematographic editing influences the viewer\u2019s perception of time. Previous behavioral research has shown that editing density affects temporal judgments. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship, we examined the role of motor system activity, specifically the supplementary motor area (SMA), in time perception when individuals are exposed to moving images with different cinematographic editing styles. Forty-eight university students were assigned to one of three tDCS conditions (anodal, cathodal, or sham). They viewed nine silent video clips with different editing styles (master shot, slow-paced, fast-paced) that were specifically created for research. The participants rated perceived duration, time passage, action speed, and emotional engagement, while tDCS was applied for 20 min targeting the SMA. The results revealed that SMA excitability modulation affected duration estimates, time passage, and action speed judgments by interacting with the editing style of the clips. These findings highlight the importance of the SMA in modulating time perception during film viewing. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms that shape the viewer\u2019s perception of film time as an integral part of experiencing movement in cinema.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

Five eigenvalues were used to analyze EEG data in 5 frequency bands. Statistically significant indicator eigenvalues (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Paired t-test showed significant differences in PSQI and ISI total scores before and after TMS treatment, indicating its therapeutic effect. Correlation coefficients between 40 indicators and scale differences were calculated, and significant characteristic values were further analyzed. SVR models for predicting ISI and PSQI scale pre-post differences were constructed. Both had predictive ability.ConclusionThis work proposes the first SVR model leveraging pre-treatment EEG features to predict TMS therapeutic outcomes for insomnia. TMS treatment can change brain waves, and the model is expected to be applied clinically, though with limitations such as small sample size and insufficiently detailed brain region division.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
