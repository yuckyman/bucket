      "content": "IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in all age groups. The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",

      "title": "Imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning for sparse badminton strikes via dynamic trajectory generation",
      "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

      "title": "Molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease onset in a mouse model: effects of cannabidiol treatment",
      "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative condition involving a complex blend of disturbances in synaptic development and maintenance, neurovascular cross-talk, ionic and nutrient transport, and mitochondrial metabolism. The precise molecular profile of AD onset with insight for major pathological contributors remains unclear with corresponding impedances in therapeutic development. The current study sought two objectives, as (i) to resolve the molecular pathogenesis from cognitive impairment to the onset of AD-like neuropathology and (ii) whether the novel agent cannabidiol (CBD), noted for its neuroprotective effects, influences the molecular transition associated with AD onset.MethodsDietary CBD was administered daily (80\u2013100 mg/kg/day) in male 3xTg-AD mice and wild-type B6129SF2/J animals from 4.5 to 6.5 mo of age with inclusion of vehicle controls. RNA sequencing encompassed longitudinal and cross-sectional blood and brain samples, respectively. Metabolomics and behavioral analyses examined brain regions (cortex, hippocampus) and associated integrated neurocircuitry.Results and discussionThere were >1,000 differentially expressed markers of AD onset, whereby >75% were either eliminated or reversed in the direction of expression in response to CBD. Signaling pathways encompassed synaptic development and plasticity (e.g., Foxp2), neurovascular interactions (Smad9, Angptl6), receptors and ion channels (Gria4, Chrna2, Rgs7/Rgs7bp), mitochondrial genes (Ndufa7, Cox7a2), immunity (Ncr1), oxidation-reduction (Esr1), lipid synthesis (Fasn, ApoE), and carbohydrate metabolism (Mafa, Mlxipl). As potentially addressable with CBD treatment, AD onset represents molecular integration of neurovascular interactions, channelopathies, metabolic disturbances, and aberrations in developmental genes with involvement of major pathological contributors such as inflammation, oxidative signaling, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance.",

      "title": "Somatosensory cross-modal activation and changes in cortical somatosensory evoked potential responses in single-sided deafness: an EEG study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe neural mechanisms underlying somatosensory processing in individuals with acquired single-sided deafness (SSD) and potential central neuronal cross-modal reorganization remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of SSD on somatosensory perception and attentional processing.MethodsElectrophysiological responses using EEG, and behavioral measures (discrimination thresholds, hit rates and reaction times) were assessed in adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls for vibrotactile stimulation at two distinct frequencies. Differences in cortical somatosensory evoked potentials between adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls, focusing on peak amplitudes and peak times of key event-related potential components (P50, N70, P100, N140, and P3b) and their cortical generators were assessed.ResultsWhile both groups exhibited comparable behavioral performance, significant differences emerged in electrophysiological responses. Individuals with SSD showed increased P3b amplitude (albeit non-significant) and significantly delayed P3b peak times, indicating that individuals with acquired SSD exhibit alterations in attentional mechanisms associated with somatosensory perception. In addition, source localization analysis of the P50 component using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed group differences in cortical activation patterns, with SSD individual showing additional recruitment of auditory-related areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus and the insula. This further supports the notion of compensatory neuroplasticity in auditory pathways following severe to profound unilateral hearing loss.ConclusionOur results indicate that SSD is associated with neural reorganization in somatosensory and auditory pathways. The observed modifications in both early and late somatosensory responses, coupled with alterations in source activity, suggest that individuals with SSD engage alternative neural mechanisms when processing vibrotactile stimuli, differing from the typical patterns observed in NH individuals. Understanding these changes prior to cochlear implantation will facilitate the development of personalized auditory rehabilitation strategies following cochlear implantation.",

      "content": "The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a community-driven standard for the organization of data and metadata from a growing range of neuroscience modalities. This paper is meant as a history of how the standard has developed and grown over time. We outline the principles behind the project, the mechanisms by which it has been extended, and some of the challenges being addressed as it evolves. We also discuss the lessons learned through the project, with the aim of enabling researchers in...",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",
