      "title": "Theta Activity Supports Landmark-Based Correction of Naturalistic Human Path Integration",
      "content": "<p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<i>.</i></p>",

      "title": "Cofilin Inhibition Ameliorates PIEZO2 and AMPA Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Angelman Syndrome",
      "content": "<p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of uncertainty processing: meta-analysis of fMRI studies",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty represents a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the consistent neural correlates of uncertainty processing specifically during decision-making tasks.MethodsWe synthesized findings from 76 fMRI studies (N = 4,186 participants). Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method, we performed a voxel-wise meta-analysis of activation foci to identify brain regions consistently activated across studies.ResultsThe analysis revealed nine distinct activation clusters, revealing a comprehensive neural network involved in uncertainty processing. Key findings demonstrated predominant activations in the anterior insula (up to 63.7% representation), inferior frontal gyrus (up to 40.7%), and inferior parietal lobule (up to 78.1%). We found a functional specialization between emotional-motivational processes (clusters 1\u20135) and cognitive processes (clusters 6\u20139), with notable hemispheric asymmetries. The left anterior insula was more strongly associated with reward evaluation, while the right was involved in learning and cognitive control. Similarly, the right inferior frontal gyrus was linked to impulse control, and the left to motor planning.DiscussionOur findings extend the current understanding of the neural architecture of decision-making under uncertainty. The comprehensive mapping of neural signatures advances our knowledge of the distinct roles of key brain regions and provides insights into potential clinical applications, particularly for developing interventions for uncertainty-related anxiety. The study highlights important directions for future research in cognitive neuroscience and clinical practice.",

      "title": "Inter-brain synchrony between undergraduate students during a naturalistic online seminar predicted greater relational satisfaction and task performance",
      "content": "As higher education increasingly transitions to online platforms such as Zoom, understanding the mechanisms that underlie effective virtual collaboration has become essential. Prior research has shown that relational quality, trust, and communication strongly influence online collaborative learning; however, the real-time cognitive and affective dynamics underpinning these interactions are yet to be elucidated. This study addresses this gap by examining inter-brain synchrony (IBS)\u2014the alignment of neural activity between individuals\u2014as an indicator of collaborative success. Using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we investigated IBS in 30 dyads of undergraduate students engaged in a naturalistic three-phase Zoom seminar comprising lecture viewing, interactive discussion, and a presentation. Inter-brain synchrony between partners was computed in the prefrontal cortex, and outcomes were assessed via relational satisfaction questionnaires and standardized ratings of presentations. Results showed that IBS emerged predominantly during active discussions, but not during passive lecture viewing, underscoring the importance of interactive engagement in generating neural alignment. Crucially, higher IBS during discussion predicted both greater group relational satisfaction and improved task performance. These findings extend prior evidence that IBS supports cooperation, demonstrating that neural synchrony can occur even without physical co-presence and is associated with both performance and satisfaction in virtual educational settings.",

      "title": "Ferroptosis in ischemic stroke: mechanisms, pathological implications, and therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal mechanism in the complex pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, a leading cause of global death and disability. This review synthesizes current understanding of the core ferroptosis pathways, including iron dysregulation, glutathione depletion, and GPX4 inactivation and distinguishes it from other cell death modalities. We critically explore its role as a pathogenic amplifier in stroke, synergizing with neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction to expand neuronal injury. The review systematically assesses therapeutic strategies, from iron chelators and lipid peroxidation inhibitors (e.g., ferrostatin-1) to emerging gene therapies and nanomedicine-based approaches, based on robust preclinical evidence. However, translating these findings faces challenges, including a narrow therapeutic window, patient heterogeneity, and the need to balance efficacy with safety concerning systemic iron and lipid metabolism. To overcome these translational challenges, future research must prioritize the discovery of clinical biomarkers (e.g., FABP5) and the development of targeted delivery systems to advance ferroptosis-directed therapies for stroke.",

      "title": "Expression of dementia biomarkers in Appalachian and non-Appalachian ELVO patients during thrombectomy",
      "content": "Background/ContextVascular Cognitive Impairment and Dementia (VCID) affects 25-30% of stroke patients and includes cognitive impairments caused by vascular injury, such as post-stroke dementia. Rehabilitation has the potential to improve the quality of life for patients at risk of developing dementia. However, there is currently no reliable method to identify those at risk of dementia after a stroke. Several biomarkers, including ADRD (Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias) biomarkers (Ab, tau, NfL, and GFAP) and angiogenic factors (VEGF, Flt-1, Tie-2, PIGF, and FGF) have been associated with the development of dementia.Populations in Appalachia experience a higher incidence of stroke and related mortality compared to other groups. Given the elevated stroke rates in Appalachian communities, this study aims to investigate potential proteomic differences between patients from Appalachian and non-Appalachian counties. The primary goal of the study is to characterize the expression of post-stroke cognitive dementia biomarkers and to explore differences in the proteomic profiles of Appalachian and non-Appalachian populations.Methods/ApproachSample Collection: The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry Collaborative (BACTRAC) protocol, established by Fraser and colleagues, introduces a novel method for analyzing stroke by collecting intracranial blood samples from patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy. During the procedure the thrombus and blood samples from areas distal and proximal to the thrombus are collected and undergo proteomic analysis (Fraser et al.). Additional demographic and clinical information are collected from electronic health records. The control data was obtained from arterial blood collected during diagnostic angiograms from patients with cerebrovascular disease.Data AnalysisPropensity score models were used to perform a one-to-one match between stroke and control patients on age, sex, BMI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia resulting in groups that were balanced on these measured prognostic characteristics. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was then used to assess differences in the 12 ADRD biomarkers.ResultsCompared to the controls, stroke patients had significantly higher levels of GFAP. The control patients had significantly higher levels of AB40, AB42, and VEGFA. In the Appalachian patient population, the control patients also had significantly higher levels of AB40, AB42, and VEGFA. Additionally, the Appalachian stroke patients had higher GFAP. In the non-Appalachian population only GFAP was significantly different between stroke and control groups, with it being elevated in the stroke group.ConclusionThere was a notable difference in the levels of certain ADRD biomarkers between stroke patients and control patients. Specifically, in Appalachian populations, stroke patients showed significant differences in multiple ADRD biomarkers (AB40, AB42, and GFAP) compared to controls, a pattern not seen in non-Appalachian stroke patients, where only GFAP levels increased. This difference in ADRD biomarkers observed in Appalachian stroke patients could be attributed to a combination of socioeconomic and environmental factors unique to the Appalachian region.",

      "title": "A deep hybrid CSAE-GRU framework with two-stage balancing for automatic epileptic seizure detection using EEG-derived features",
      "content": "IntroductionEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal neuronal discharges in the brain, posing a persistent challenge in clinical diagnosis. This study presents a high-performance epileptic seizure detection framework that integrates advanced feature extraction and classification techniques using EEG signals.MethodsWe conduct experiments on the Bonn and CHB-MIT EEG datasets. The EEG signals are preprocessed through bandpass filtering and five-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition. From each sub-band, four representative features are systematically extracted. To mitigate severe class imbalance, we propose a two-stage balancing strategy: cluster centroid-based under-sampling initially reduces the interictal-to-ictal ratio to 2:1, followed by Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (BLSMOTE) in the feature space. A hybrid classification model that combines Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is proposed in the paper. The encoder weights from the pre-trained CSAE are transferred to the GRU-based classifier to enhance feature representation and model generalization.ResultsThe proposed method achieves outstanding performance, with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, f1 score and AUC of 98.46, 98.27, 98.50, 98.36, 98.31, and 98.23% on the Bonn dataset, and 99.49, 99.21, 99.77, 99.49, 99.35, and 99.57% on the CHB-MIT dataset, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.DiscussionThis study introduces a novel framework combining cluster centroid-based under-sampling, BLSMOTE oversampling, and transfer learning via CSAE-GRU integration. The method offers a promising direction for reliable and clinically applicable automated epilepsy diagnosis.",
