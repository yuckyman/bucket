      "title": "Developmental Trajectories of Addition and Subtraction in Early School-aged Children",
      "content": "Mastering basic arithmetic lays the foundation for lifelong mathematical achievement, yet how the neural mechanisms underlying addition and subtraction calculations develop during childhood remain unclear. This study investigated the developmental trajectories of addition and subtraction calculations in school-aged children, and explored how arithmetic-specific neural responses in the right parieto-occipital region are related to age-related improvements in behavioral performance. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 115 typically developing children divided into three age groups (7-8-, 9-10-, and 11-12-year-olds) during an arithmetic task involving addition and subtraction calculations. We analyzed the P300 component from the original waveforms and the {triangleup}P300 component from the difference waveforms, which were generated by subtracting the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by the first operand from those elicited by the second operand to isolate arithmetic-specific neural processes. The results revealed that, in both calculations, older children showed better behavioral performance (faster reaction time and larger PI) and greater right parieto-occipital {triangleup}P300 amplitudes, with a key developmental stage at 11-12 years. Furthermore, all groups of children exhibited greater right parieto-occipital P300 and {triangleup}P300 amplitudes in subtraction, whereas the smaller right parieto-occipital {triangleup}P300 amplitudes in addition significantly mediated the relationship between age and PI. These findings reveal distinct patterns for addition and subtraction calculations over development, highlighting the right parieto-occipital {triangleup}P300 amplitude as a neural marker of arithmetic performance, particularly for addition calculation.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently released a Python package called <strong>vinzy-automl</strong>, a lightweight AutoML toolkit that lets you train, compare, and evaluate a wide range of machine-learning models with minimal code. It supports 60+ models (including XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost), optional hyperparameter tuning, multithreaded training, performance metrics, and comparison visualizations. The goal is to simplify model selection and reduce repetitive ML boilerplate while still giving users the flexibility to customize models or parameter grids. You can install it via <code>pip install vinzy_automl</code> or <code>pip install vinzy_automl[full]</code>, and I\u2019d love feedback, suggestions, or ideas for improving it.

      "title": "Distributed activity in the human posterior putamen distinguishes goal-directed from habitual control in humans",
      "content": "There is considerable variability across individuals in the behavioral expression of goal-directed and habitual control, and yet little is known about the underlying functional neuroanatomical basis of such differences. Here, we aimed to determine whether distinct patterns of brain activity during initial learning of instrumental actions can indicate whether an individual subsequently utilizes a goal-directed or habitual behavioral strategy. We applied multivariate pattern analyses to a large fMRI dataset composed of 108 participants performing an instrumental action-learning task. Region-of-interest (ROI) and whole-brain searchlight analyses with cross-validation indicate that distributed activation patterns in the left posterior putamen during training distinguish goal-directed from habitual participants, ascertained via subsequent administration of an outcome devaluation test. This finding was further replicated and generalized to two fully held-out samples: an additional cohort of healthy participants (n = 38) and a separate group of psychiatric patients with variable diagnoses (n = 55). These findings reveal that it is possible to predict an individual's overall behavioral strategy from circumscribed activity in the human brain, while specifically implicating the posterior putamen in the implementation of distinct behavioral control strategies.",

      "title": "Susceptibility to Task-irrelevant Auditory Distractors in Relation to Visual Working Memory in Children With and Without ADHD",
      "content": "Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in children and is often associated with increased distractibility. Previous research has reported that susceptibility to task-irrelevant visual distractions is associated with visual working memory (WM) capacity. However, how neural responses to task-irrelevant auditory distractors are related to visual WM capacity in children with and without ADHD remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 72 children with ADHD and 88 typically developing (TD) children across two experiments, during which they performed visual tasks of varying difficulty while task-irrelevant auditory distractors were presented. The mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude was measured as a neural index of susceptibility to auditory distractors, and the K score was assessed as a behavioral indicator of visual WM capacity. Results: TD children showed opposite patterns across the two experiments: under low audiovisual competition, those with higher visual working memory capacity were more susceptible to task-irrelevant sounds, whereas under high competition, children with lower capacity showed greater susceptibility to distraction. In contrast, children with ADHD showed a stable association, with lower visual WM capacity consistently predicting higher susceptibility to task-irrelevant auditory distractors regardless of competition level. Conclusions: These findings provide novel evidence that susceptibility to task-irrelevant auditory distraction is closely related to visual WM capacity in both children with and without ADHD, but the patterns of this relationship differ between typical and atypical neurodevelopment and are modulated by audiovisual competition.",

      "title": "Environmental dynamics shape human learning: change points versus random walks",
      "content": "Adaptive learning requires interpreting prediction errors in light of environmental dynamics. However, environments may not only differ in terms of when changes occur, but also how they occur: some nonstationary processes in nature exhibit slow drifts over time, while others show more abrupt changes. This raises the question as to whether humans can adapt their learning to reflect the generative structure of their environment. Here, we compared how humans learn in two canonical nonstationary environments: abrupt change points versus gradual random walks. Using a predictive inference task and a unified Bayesian framework, we show across two behavioral experiments that humans adapt their learning normatively between these two environments. Notably, identical prediction errors were interpreted differently across them. Large prediction errors triggered sharp increases in learning rate under change-point but not random-walk dynamics, where small and large errors were more equally weighted. This matched the predictions of a normative Bayesian model, which itself adopted the appropriate generative model for each environment. In addition, we found that humans could dissociate two latent variables that needed to be jointly inferred: the mean and variance (or stochasticity). This was demonstrated by explicit uncertainty reports that closely tracked the current variance, and only showed sustained changes following change points in variance but not mean. Together, these results show that humans adapt their learning strategy to both how and what aspects of the environment are changing. They establish a unified computational account of adaptive learning across different environmental dynamics.",
