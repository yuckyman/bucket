      "title": "On collective behavior in C. elegans",
      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.
