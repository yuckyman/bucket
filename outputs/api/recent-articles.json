      "title": "A Cell-Based Assay to Categorize Variants of Human Succinate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder",
      "content": "Many genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a result of sequencing the genomes of individuals with ASD, however in most cases it remains unclear which genes are playing causative roles. ALDH5A1, which encodes the enzyme succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), an important regulator of GABA metabolism, is causative in the syndrome SSADH deficiency and is also implicated in ASD. However, it is unknown how variants found in ASD affect SSADH function. We developed a yeast growth assay that models SSADH deficiency to quantify the functional impact of seven ALDH5A1 variants found in ASD. In this assay, expression of human ALDH5A1 partially complemented the growth defect caused by deletion of the ALDH5A1 ortholog UGA2. Using growth rate measurements, we calculated functional scores for 27 variants divided into calibration and ASD test variant groups. Functional scores for benign and pathogenic calibration variants segregated accordingly, validating the assay, while ASD variants displayed a range of activities from complete loss to normal function. Comparisons with published enzymatic assays and computational predictions showed broad agreement, while also identifying some limitations of these approaches.",

      "title": "Microglial epigenetic memory is associated with accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain induced by prophylactic macrophage-derived small extracellular vesicles",
      "content": "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) including exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and can exert immunomodulatory effects in recipient cells. We have shown that a single prophylactic intrathecal injection of sEVs from RAW 264.7 macrophages two weeks prior, promotes faster resolution of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) mouse model of inflammatory pain. How this long-term memory develops, and how sEVs regulate immune responses are unknown. Recent studies have shown that priming microglia with inflammatory stimuli can enhance or suppress responses to a delayed secondary insult via epigenetic modifications. We hypothesized that prophylactic intrathecal administration of macrophage-derived sEVs confers accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain by reprogramming epigenetic memory in spinal microglia in recipient CFA model mice. To determine whether prophylactic sEVs could attenuate pain in the absence of microglia when administering sEVs, we ablated microglia using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622. sEV-induced pain prophylaxis was completely abolished in PLX5622-fed mice, indicating that microglia are required to be present during sEV administration to confer early resolution of inflammatory pain hypersensitivity. ChIP-seq analysis in spinal microglia 14 days after sEV administration (prior to CFA) revealed an increased number of gene loci enriched for H3K4me1, a hallmark of innate immune memory. Furthermore, inhibiting the H3K4 mono-methyltransferase SETD7 abolished sEV-induced pain attenuation. Our findings indicate that both microglia and its epigenetic reprogramming contribute to pain prophylaxis induced by macrophage-derived sEVs, providing novel insights into the development of non-addictive preventive analgesia.",

      "content": "Polyglutamine diseases are incurable genetic neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of mutant proteins with extended polyglutamine fragments, which are prone to the formation of poorly soluble aggregates. The establishment of adequate cellular models is crucial in uncovering the pathological mechanisms responsible for neurotoxicity in HD, screening for therapeutic molecules and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms impacted by particular compound. In the present study, genetic constructs based on the Sleeping Beauty system were created for the stable inducible expression of full-length normal and mutant huntingtin in eukaryotic cells. These constructs were then employed to develop model neuronal cells using Neuro-2a cell line. The expression of huntingtin as well as the accumulation of Htt-immunopositive intracellular aggregates (most characteristic features of HD) was demonstrated, and these aggregates mostly colocalized with the proteasome. The activation of the proteasome, as well as changes in the expression of proteasome regulators, components of the autophagy system, and the protease cathepsin D, reflect the versatility of cellular responses to the destructive mutant Htt pathological forms.",

      "title": "Temporal Patterns of Brain Network Plasticity During the Onset and Maintenance of Neuropathic Pain in Male Mice",
      "content": "Neuropathic pain arises from complex peripheral and central mechanisms and induces long-lasting maladaptive changes in the brain. To investigate the temporal dynamics of these changes, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in a mouse model of neuropathic pain across its initiation and maintenance phases. Using functional ultrasound imaging to capture whole-brain FC over disease progression, we conducted two complementary studies: a longitudinal assessment in anesthetized animals and an analysis of awake cohorts at distinct disease stages. Both exploratory and literature-guided analyses revealed that FC across most large-scale networks remained remarkably stable during pain maintenance. In contrast, pain onset was marked by enhanced FC between key regions involved in sensory, emotional, and motivational processing, including the motor cortex and nucleus accumbens, the prelimbic and insular cortices, and the infralimbic cortex and hypothalamus. As pain persisted, we observed reduced FC within the somatomotor network, reflecting functional disconnection. Additionally, postsurgical pain alone produced enduring FC changes within the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and insula, indicating long-term central plasticity independent of neuropathic injury. Together, these findings reveal dynamic, network-specific adaptations that distinguish the onset and maintenance phases of neuropathic pain and surgery-related plasticity.",

      "title": "The influence of force on the encoding and perception of affective touch",
      "content": "Stroking touch has been shown to be most pleasant at intermediate velocities of 1-10 cm.s-1, which relates well to activity of C-low threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), also called C-tactile afferents in humans, that have been implicated in encoding positive affective touch. This well-established finding has been demonstrated at gentle stroking forces (typically 0.4 N peak normal force), yet few studies have investigated the effect of force on the perception of stroking touch or on the activity of C-LTMRs. Presently, we investigated the perceptual pleasantness and intensity of stroking touch (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 cm.s-1) at different forces (0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 N) on hairy forearm skin and compared this to responses from C-LTMRs during stroking touch at the same velocities, but over fewer forces (0.05, 0.4, 1.5 N). We found significant effects of stroking velocity and force for both tactile pleasantness and intensity ratings. Pleasantness showed the typical inverted-U shaped relationship over stroking velocities, but this was modified by force: higher forces significantly decreased pleasantness at faster velocities. Conversely, tactile intensity increased linearly with both increasing velocity and force. Recordings from five C-LTMRs showed that their firing frequency changed with stroking velocity, but that they were strongly modulated by force. Overall, we demonstrate the profound effect that force has on the perception of stroking touch, where tactile pleasantness and intensity appear to be a multi-faceted construct that are related to C-LTMR and A{beta}-LTMR activity, respectively, but that the firing in individual mechanoreceptor populations cannot fully account for percepts.",

      "title": "Guessing reveals internal models of perceptual precision",
      "content": "When observers lack sufficient information to support a confident response, they often guess. Guessing plays a pervasive role in visual cognition and working memory, yet the mechanisms that govern how observers generate guesses remain poorly understood. Standard models traditionally assume that responses produced in the absence of information are either uniformly distributed over feature space or are perhaps weighted towards prevailing environmental statistics. In contrast, here we consider an intriguing alternative: that guesses incorporate observers' knowledge of their own perceptual capacities. We empirically measured guessing by eliciting responses under extreme target uncertainty (Experiment 1) as well as a novel '0ms presentation' approach in which no stimulus appeared but subjects believed one had (Experiment 2). We evaluated three accounts of guesses under these conditions: unsystematic (lapse) responding, biases toward environmental statistics, and a self-representational account in which guesses reflect observers' knowledge of their own feature-dependent precision (e.g., preferring to guess feature values they believe they would be likely to miss). Guess responses were non-uniform and systematically biased toward feature values typically encoded with the least precision (e.g., oblique orientations) - a counterintuitive bias away from high-frequency, high-fidelity feature values (e.g., cardinal orientations). This complementary relationship between guessing and perceptual fidelity held within individuals and across paradigms, and was recoverable via an empirical-guess mixture model that replaced the standard uniform assumption with empirically measured guess distributions. Our findings challenge prevailing views that guesses reflect random noise, and suggest instead that guessing behavior reflects metacognitive knowledge of internal precision. Rather than defaulting to environmental priors, observers appear to model their own sensory limitations and leverage these representations to inform decisions in the absence of evidence. These results reframe guessing as a theoretically informative behavior that expresses observers' own beliefs about their perceptual capacities.",
