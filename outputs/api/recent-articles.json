      "title": "Environmental factors contribute to cancer therapy toxicity",
      "content": "Cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) affects numerous cancer patients, however there is substantial variability in its severity. Here, we investigated how environmental factors such as housing facility and time of treatment, known as chronotherapy, impact chemotoxicity in a pediatric murine model of methotrexate (MTX)-induced CRCI. We find that MTX consistently impacts body mass in a time-of-day specific manner across different housing facilities. Intriguingly, investigation of the gut microbiome acutely after MTX chronotherapy revealed substantial differences in microbial composition between animals housed in different facilities as well as decreased microbial diversity at different times of day. Furthermore, these differences in the gut microbiome after MTX chronotherapy coincide with differences in circulating inflammatory cytokine profiles between facilities and times of day. Chronically, housing facility continued to impact serum cytokine levels after MTX treatment, whereas the effect of time wanes. Nonetheless, we found that time drastically alters chronic white matter microglial gene expression in the central nervous system (CNS) after MTX treatment. Together, these findings demonstrate that both housing facility and time dictate response to MTX chronotherapy in the periphery and CNS. Collectively, this work elucidates putative factors that can regulate MTX-induced chemotoxicity.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting millions worldwide. Defining early pathobiological events remains challenging, in part due to inaccessibility of neural tissue. Because olfactory neurons are accessible, and olfactory loss is prevalent in AD, we evaluated olfactory brush biopsies from controls, individuals with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-confirmed AD, and cognitively typical individuals whose positive biomarkers signal a pre-clinical AD stage. We define via single cell RNA-sequencing (n=22 subjects) conserved neuroinflammatory T cell, myeloid, and olfactory neuron changes detectable even in pre-clinical AD subjects. Activated memory T cell states were a hallmark of pre-clinical AD, paralleling CSF T cell phenotypes seen in advanced disease, accompanied by both microglia-like inflammatory programs and olfactory neuron inflammatory injury. Together, our findings establish a novel platform permitting analysis of neural tissue in AD at its earliest stages.",

      "title": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis",
      "content": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is best known as a neuropeptide that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Independent from its activity in the HPT axis, TRH also exerts strong neuroprotective activity against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Although multiple factors have been linked to its neuroprotective action, the cellular mechanism of TRH neuroprotection is still not clear. Here we show that TRH protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis. Both adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated TRH transduction and TRH peptide given exogenously over 24 hours period of time inhibit glutamate-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. This effect is not mediated by the decreased intracellular calcium response as TRH treatment (24 hours) has no effect on glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium nor the calpain activity. While TRH treatment (10 minutes) significantly inhibits glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium, no protective effect is observed when TRH is applied 30 minutes before or after glutamate stimulation. Instead, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibits the protective effect of TRH. LY294002 also blocks TRH induced AKT activation. In addition, protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibits the protective effect of TRH. Taken together, these results suggest PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and new protein synthesis are involved in the protective effect of TRH against glutamate toxicity, thereby providing mechanistic support for its action in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Multiple patterns of selectivity in superior colliculus control visual search",
      "content": "Visual search is a ubiquitous behavior for many animal species, but efficient search performance requires a relatively complex integration of target guidance and behavioral history signals. In this study, we investigate how the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain area implicated in the control of overt spatial attention, integrates these two control signals in a multi-target search task. Monkeys made sequences of saccades to stimuli presented in a grid while searching for a \"true\" (reward eliciting) target amid color-coded targets and distractors. The efficient performance of this task requires integrating a target guidance signal with a history of previously fixated locations in order to guide search to new potential targets that might offer reward. Theories of systems neuroscience suggest that this multi-factor search behavior might be controlled using either mixed selectivity, dynamic selectivity, or pure selectivity. We find evidence for SC neurons exhibiting each of these patterns and conclude that this brain structure participates in circuits representing target similarity and previously fixated locations, in addition to a circuit responsible for integrating these signals using the mechanisms of dynamic and mixed selectivity. We also introduce a novel time-series partial information decomposition analysis that provides a rich and direct view of how a neuron allocates its representational capacity. These findings support an emerging view of the superior colliculus as much more than a bottom-up priority map, but instead an important site for the flexible cognitive control of visually-guided behavior.",

      "title": "Scalable spike sorting across thousands of neurons by modeling neural dynamics with NeuroSort",
      "content": "Neural circuit research requires resolving the functional coding mechanisms at the single-neuron scale. However, neural signals captured from extracellular recordings are inherently complex, shaped both by electrode properties and the spatially distributed neural population activity across recording sites. These factors introduce strong signal mixing and waveform variation, making it diffcult for existing spike sorting methods to reliably isolate individual neurons from large-scale recodings. To address this, we develop NeuroSort, which fuses spatiotemporal information through a contrastive learning strategy to adaptively model neural dynamics. NeuroSort is a GPU-enabled, highly efficient spike sorting framework, enabling the isolating of up to thousands of neurons. We validated NeuroSort on in vivo extracellular recordings, including Utah array data from rhesus macaques performing motor tasks and Neuropixels 1.0 probe data from a rat during rest. Moreover, in a recording collected by the 1,024-channel Neuroscroll probe, NeuroSort sorted the largest number of well-isolated neurons from different brain areas while achieving a 2-8 times speedup over other methods.Taken together, NeuroSort generalizes across recording conditions, providing an interpretable and scalable paradigm for whole-brain dynamic analysis.",
