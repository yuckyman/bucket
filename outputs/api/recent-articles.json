      "title": "Resting-state and task-related neurometabolite levels differentially relate to cortical excitability in the sensorimotor and prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Background. Normal brain function requires a dynamic balance between inhibition and excitation. While magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantifies the chief inhibitory and excitatory neurometabolites, GABA and glutamate-glutamine (Glx), the combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) provides a complementary measure of cortical inhibition-excitation dynamics via transcranial evoked potentials (TEPs). However, the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs is unclear. Objective. To characterize the relationship between neurometabolite concentrations and TEPs, as a function of TEP component, TMS pulse type, brain region, neurometabolite, and MRS brain state. Methods. Twenty-five young healthy adults completed a 4-day protocol. Sessions 1 and 2 involved screening, anatomical MRI, and functional MRI localization of DLPFC. In session 3, single- and paired-pulse TMS-EEG were applied over SM1 and DLPFC. Session 4 included resting-state and motor-task-related MRS of SM1 and DLPFC. Results. In SM1, task-related GABAergic tone strongly predicted early to mid-latency TEPs. In DLPFC, local early to mid-latency TEPs showed no relationship to neurometabolites, whereas late and global TEP outcomes revealed some links. The later N100 TEP was the only component consistently modulated by paired-pulse TMS. Task-related MRS measures consistently outperformed resting-state measures in predicting TEPs for SM1, while the opposite was true for DLPFC. Conclusions. Single-pulse TEPs reliably index the local inhibitory tone in SM1, with limited added value from paired-pulse paradigms. These findings support the use of single-pulse TEPs as accessible markers of cortical inhibition, especially for SM1, and may inform biomarkers and strategies for individualized neuromodulation.",

      "title": "Neonatal brain-age models in full- and preterm infants",
      "content": "Prematurity affects brain development and increases risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. Yet reliable biomarkers for at-risk infants remain limited. The goals of this study are (1a) to construct a white matter neonatal brain-age model including full-term and preterm neonates from a large publicly-available data set, (1b) to evaluate the accuracy of this model for characterizing the preterm brain from the same data set; (2) to determine if a similar model can predict brain-age based on clinical MRI scans from high-risk neonates born preterm; and (3) to evaluate whether this predictive model provides information about the infant's health beyond conventional clinical and demographic measures. We developed brain-age prediction models using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging-derived white matter features from two datasets: (1) the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP; 368 healthy infants) and (2) a clinical sample collected at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital (LPCH; 162 high-risk preterm infants). White matter features demonstrated strong predictive performance in the dHCP dataset (within 3.9 days) and the LPCH clinical dataset (within 6.6 days). However, brain-age metrics (i.e., brain-age gap) showed no significant associations with health complications measured by a composite score of common prematurity complications. While tractometry-derived brain-age models accurately characterize brain maturation in the neonatal brain, their sensitivity to clinical complications in preterm infants appears limited. Global white matter maturation measures derived from clinical grade data may be insufficiently sensitive to capture the cumulative burden of prematurity-related morbidities, suggesting need for multimodal or longitudinal biomarkers.",

      "title": "Neural Measures of Human Decision Making Track Evidence Accumulation in Learned Space",
      "content": "Neural decision-making flexibly integrates evidence across sensory, mnemonic, and semantic domains. Yet all prior demonstrations involve evidence that is either directly available in stimuli or retrieved from established representations. A fundamental question remains: does neural evidence accumulation extend to decisions based on evidence that must be computed through learned representational transformations? Here we show it does. We recorded scalp EEG while participants classified continuously-oriented visual stimuli into discrete categories defined by an experimenter-imposed boundary. Category-level evidence was operationalized as category coherence, or the angular distance between each stimulus and the learned boundary. We predicted that if neural decision mechanisms are truly domain-general, the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), a scalp EEG potential indexing evidence accumulation, should scale with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP sensitivity should correlate with computational drift rates. Both predictions were supported: CPP slopes increased monotonically with category coherence, and individual differences in CPP slopes correlated with individual differences in drift rates across participants. These findings reveal that the brain's decision machinery treats evidence identically regardless of its representational origin - whether externally available, pre-existing, or computed through learned transformations.",

      "title": "Large-scale brain network differences during deliberate and spontaneous mind-wandering in a sustained attention task: An electroencephalography source-level connectivity study",
      "content": "Mind-wandering (MW), the shift of attention away from an ongoing task, can be classified as either deliberate or spontaneous, depending on whether these internal thoughts arise intentionally or unintentionally. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging-based resting state studies have shown that spontaneous MW traits are positively correlated with coupling within the default mode network (DMN), whereas deliberate MW traits are positively correlated with coupling both within the DMN and between the DMN and control- or attention-related networks. However, state-based functional connectivity during each MW episode remains unknown. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigated how deliberate and spontaneous MW differentially involve state-based large-scale network interactions during a sustained attention task using electroencephalography (EEG), which captures rapid network dynamics. Thirty-one participants performed the gradual-onset continuous performance task using 64-channel EEG. Mental states were classified via experience-sampling probes as on-task, deliberate, or spontaneous MW. EEG data from 1-s pre-probe epochs were analyzed using source estimation and the weighted phase lag index to assess functional connectivity within and across the DMN, control network (CN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network (SN) in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. Relative to both spontaneous MW and the on-task state, deliberate MW was characterized by significantly stronger alpha band functional connectivity. A prominent connectivity cluster was centered on the right frontal operculum-insula of the SN, linking regions across the SN, CN, and DMN. In addition, deliberate MW exhibited enhanced SN-DAN-DMN coupling compared with the on-task state. By contrast, spontaneous MW did not show significant connectivity differences relative to the on-task state in any frequency band. Taken together, these results suggest that alpha band network interactions centered on the SN may contribute to the intentional regulation of internally directed thought during deliberate MW.",

      "content": "Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have immense potential regarding the provision of therapies for disorders of development, but to date have typically been created for non-linguistic disorders such as ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Here we present a BCI that aims to improve linguistic phonological processing in developmental dyslexia. Phonological 'deficits' are considered a core feature of dyslexia across languages. A non-invasive EEG-BCI relying on auditory inputs and visual feedback was developed to optimise brain patterns related to phonology (speech-sound processing). These patterns were identified using Temporal Sampling (TS) theory, which proposes that phonological difficulties in dyslexia are related to impaired auditory processing of amplitude envelope rise times and low-frequency speech envelope information <10 Hz. These impairments are thought to affect automatic features of speech processing from birth, impairing the development of a phonological system. Adults with and without a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia played the BCI for 16 sessions, and received pre- and post-testing regarding phonological awareness and single word and nonword reading skills. Significant associations between their BCI scores (a measure of BCI learning) and improvements in syllable stress discrimination, nonword reading and amplitude rise time discrimination were found. The data are interpreted with respect to TS theory.",

      "title": "Long-Term Expression and Safety of AAV1-Mediated PI3K\u03b4 Overexpression in the Adult Rat Cortex",
      "content": "Mature CNS neurons are incapable of sufficiently regenerating their axons following spinal cord injury (SCI). This is largely due to developmental changes in epigenetic control leading to suppression of axon growth transcriptomic profile, leading to a shift towards synapse function support. Recently, manipulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway through PI3K{delta} overexpression in cortical neurons enhanced axonal regeneration of corticospinal tract axons, which was accompanied by functional recovery monitored for up to 16 weeks. However, PI3K is more widely known for its role as an oncogene, and since overexpression is achieved by the use of AAVs, valid safety concerns are raised as it is unknown what the long-term consequences of sustained PI3K{delta} expression in the brain are, which may be necessary to achieve complete re-establishment of the motor pathway. In this study, AAV1-hSYN-PIK3CD was injected into the motor cortex of rats, which survived for 1 year. Comparison with uninjected control animals reveal stable PI3K{delta} expression and sustained pathway activation through increased pS6. PI3K{delta}-treated animals show absence of tumour formation, neural soma hypertrophy, glial cell activation, or haematological or biochemical abnormalities. Thus, long-term neuronal PI3K{delta} expression appears to be well tolerated and may provide a safe and durable strategy to promote functional repair following SCI.",

      "title": "Beyond the Focus of Expansion: Retinal curl as a functional signal for heading estimation",
      "content": "Prevailing models aiming at explaining heading assume that humans need to recover the Focus of Expansion (FOE) while filtering out rotational flow (curl) caused by eye movements. We propose an alternative: the visual system utilizes retinal curl directly to estimate heading, rendering the explicit recovery of the FOE unnecessary. Stationary participants viewed simulated walking paths on a large screen while fixating on ground targets at varying eccentricities -a natural behavior inducing sustained retinal curl. Participants continuously reported perceived heading. To isolate the role of rotational flow, we employed a real-time manipulation that kept translational flow constant while the foveal curl component was either intact, cancelled, or overcancelled. Under natural conditions, participants exhibited systematic heading biases opposite the direction of gaze. Crucially, these biases vanished in the 'cancelled curl' condition, identifying retinal curl as the specific driver of perceptual bias. We modeled these results using a simple feedback controller and a ring-attractor neural network featuring gaze-contingent inhibition and a 'straight-ahead' prior. These findings suggest the brain exploits the geometry of gaze stabilization to simplify navigation, treating retinal curl as a functional signal rather than noise to be filtered.",

      "content": "INTRODUCTION: Accumulation of pathological Tau precipitates neuronal malfunction in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the impact of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain, independently of Tau aggregates, remains unclarified. METHODS: We used a mouse model with conditional mapt knocking-down in forebrain of 5-7 months old animals (cTau-KO), a virus-driven selective Tau knockdown in wild-types (WT) and Tau re-expression approaches, accompanied by neurostructural, epigenetic, proteomic, electrophysiological, neurochemical and behavioral analyses. RESULTS: Loss of Tau in the adult brain of cTau-KOs triggers neuronal atrophy and malfunction, epigenetic as well cognitive and mood deficits. Importantly, these perturbations were confirmed by selective Tau loss in WT adult brain and reverted by Tau re-expression or pharmacologically-induced epigenetic correction in cTau-KOs. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight the contribution of loss of normal Tau function in the adult brain malfunction that could be relevant in diverse brain pathologies beyond AD, associated to Tau and its dysfunction.",

In this study, we investigate how image quality influences fetal brain normative models, a critical factor in this context where MRI is acquired on a moving fetus in utero. Using a multi-centric cohort of 635 fetal MRI scans, we applied a standardized visual quality control (QC) protocol with continuous quality ratings. We fit normative models for multiple brain structures under progressively relaxed QC stringency, and quantified the deviations in centile estimates relative to a high-quality reference subgroup. Our results showed that including lower-quality data systematically biased normative centiles, with the strongest effects observed in the outer centiles, particularly the lower tail (1st-10th). Bias increased progressively as QC stringency was relaxed and could not be attributed solely to the number of subjects used to fit the models. Quality-induced bias was structure-dependent, and often not visually apparent at the segmentation level. These findings highlight that image quality is an important source of bias in normative fetal brain modeling, and that increasing sample size at the expense of quality may systematically affect centile estimates, potentially jeopardizing the utility of the model.",

      "title": "Biophysically realistic network-level transport model of tau progression with exosome-mediated release and uptake processes",
      "content": "The spatiotemporal progression of tau aggregates in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's follows the brain's structural connectome, yet a profound gap exists between the slow macroscopic spread observed over years and the rapid protein kinetics occurring over hours. Current graph-diffusion models fail to reconcile this timescale disparity or incorporate the cellular mechanisms driving transmission. Here, we advance the Network Transport Model (NTM) to bridge these scales by integrating directional active transport along microtubules, continuous toxic tau production, and exosome-mediated trans-neuronal release and uptake. This framework constitutes one of the most mechanistically complete and biologically detailed models of tau spread on the whole brain to date, representing a significant innovation in how multiscale proteinopathies are simulated. To overcome the computational complexity of the underlying partial differential equations, we developed a quasi-static approximation that separates fast axonal transport from slow network-wide exchange. Simulations on the whole-brain mouse connectome demonstrate that this framework emergently replicates empirical tau propagation patterns without the need for case-specific empirical fitting. Our results identify trans-neuronal release and uptake rates as the primary mechanistic \"bottleneck\" on macroscopic spread, providing a biologically grounded explanation for the disease's slow progression. Furthermore, we find that high aggregation rates can paradoxically sequester tau within neurons, limiting global transmission, while transport polarity (anterograde vs. retrograde) fundamentally dictates spatial patterning. By linking molecular mechanics to system-wide pathology, this model provides a predictive \"in-silico\" framework to evaluate how cellular-targeted interventions might alter the trajectory of tauopathic dementias.",
