      "title": "Graded regulation of microtubule-binding of Tau by the phosphorylation state of the proline-rich region in living neurons",
      "content": "Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that plays a crucial role in maintaining neuronal morphology and axonal transport. While phosphorylation is known to regulate Tau-microtubule interactions, the contribution of specific phosphorylation patterns in situ remains poorly understood due to the complexity of the intracellular environment. In this study, we combined fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons with dephosphorylation-mimetic mutations and computational modeling to analyze the effects of phosphorylation on Tau-microtubule interaction. We particularly focused on the proline-rich region, of which phosphorylation has been studied in physiological and pathological perspectives, and generated a dephosphorylation-mimetic Tau mutant by substituting key phosphorylation sites with alanine residues and compared its microtubule-binding dynamics to those of WT-Tau in FRAP experiments. Experimental data, together with simulation-based parameter exploration, revealed that the overall number of phosphorylated sites plays a more dominant role than their specific locations in modulating Tau-microtubule affinity. These findings provide new insights into the post-translational regulation of Tau and establish a computational-experimental framework for interrogating intracellular protein dynamics.",

      "title": "Excessive activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway triggers adult-onset motor axonal degeneration",
      "content": "Axonal and synaptic degeneration are key hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we performed an unbiased forward genetic mosaic screen to identify genes required for maintenance of adult motor axons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the Drosophila leg. We identified 49 mutations in 30 genes, including mutations in 8 genes resulting in adult-onset progressive degeneration. We found that loss of pebbled (peb) function results in adult-onset motor axonal and NMJ degeneration, and age-dependent motor deficits. Peb is the Drosophila RREB1 ortholog, a C2H2 zinc-finger transcription factor that negatively regulates transcription of RAS/MAPK pathway target genes. Loss of peb function resulted in excessive RAS/MAPK pathway activation, and loss of function of other negative regulators of the RAS/MAPK pathway also induced adult-onset progressive NMJ degeneration and motor deficits. Importantly, treatment of adult flies with the MEK1/2 inhibitor mirdametinib induced a dosage-dependent rescue of peb mutant motor neurodegenerative phenotypes. Thus, RAS/MAPK pathway overactivation results in adult-onset progressive neurodegeneration, which can be prevented by RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition.",

      "content": "Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. However, tools to image glutamate dynamics in the whole brain with high spatial and temporal resolution are lacking. Therefore, we developed GluTrooper, a novel mouse line engineered for inducible and long-lasting expression of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR3. GluTrooper mice crossed with Emx1-Cre lines demonstrated uniform and stable sensor expression in excitatory neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. iGluSnFR3 expression remained stable for at least 12 months, enabling longitudinal observations of glutamate dynamics over extended periods. Using multimodal imaging in awake mice, we demonstrated the versatility of GluTrooper across multiple spatial scales: from mesoscale widefield cortical imaging to cellular resolution with two-photon microscopy. Moreover, during cortical spreading depolarization, bilateral whole-brain glutamate dynamics and contralateral cortical disinhibition were detected with high fidelity. Accordingly, the GluTrooper may open new avenues for the better understanding of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the mammalian brain.",

It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

We genetically explored OGA as a target for OGT-CDG by crossing these mice with a line carrying catalytically inactive OGA. Encouragingly, this partially restored O-GlcNAc homeostasis in brain and blood, although it did not result in significant phenotypic rescue. These findings suggest that OGA inhibition can modulate enzymatic imbalance in OGT-CDG mice, and that blood can be used to monitor the effects of interventions targeting O-GlcNAc dyshomeostasis.",

      "title": "A deep convolutional neural network trained for lightness constancy is susceptible to lightness illusions",
      "content": "Human viewers are able to perform tasks that depend on accurate estimates of surface reflectance, even across large changes in illumination and context. This is a remarkable ability, and successful image-computable models of how the visual system achieves this have remained elusive. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed that are adept at estimating surface reflectance. Here we evaluated one such network as a starting point for a new model of human lightness perception by testing whether it was susceptible to a range of classic lightness illusions. We implemented a CNN and trained it via supervised learning to estimate surface reflectance at each pixel in grayscale, rendered images of geometric objects. We examined the network's output on several illusions, including the argyle, Koffka, snake, simultaneous contrast, White's, and checkerboard illusions, as well as control figures. We included variants where low-luminance regions important to the illusions were generated either by low reflectance or by cast shadows. For comparison, we carried out a lightness matching experiment with human observers using the same stimuli, and also examined the outputs of three classic lightness and brightness models. The CNN largely removed lighting effects such as shading and shadows, and produced good reflectance estimates on a test set. It also qualitatively predicted the illusions perceived by humans in most cases, the exceptions being White's and checkerboard illusions. The CNN outperformed classical models, both at estimating reflectance and at tracking human lightness matches. These findings support a normative view of lightness perception and highlight the promise of deep learning models in this area.",

      "title": "Sex-specific trajectories of gait adaptation following partial dopaminergic lesions in a rat model of parkinsons disease",
      "content": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which gait disturbances are central to disability, yet their early manifestations remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of identifying prodromal PD in humans. Rodent models may help narrow this gap by approximating partial dopaminergic loss and enabling investigation of motor changes that precede overt symptoms. Here, we examined gait dynamics in Wistar rats following unilateral, low-dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Animals were assessed weekly for six weeks in the horizontal ladder test, where running velocity and footfall accuracy were quantified with markerless pose estimation using DeepLabCut (DLC). Lesioned animals exhibited greater tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-reactivity asymmetry than controls, reflected behaviorally as persistent but gradually attenuating deficits in gait precision. Errors peaked at week three and remained above baseline through week six. Velocity was preserved across groups, but sex differences emerged. Control females accelerated more steeply over time, whereas lesioned females showed attenuated gains and greater variability, while males displayed more homogeneous velocity profiles across conditions. Together, these findings indicate that partial SNc lesions reveal sex-specific trajectories of motor adaptation, a feature relevant to modeling prodromal PD. Combined with DLC-based tracking, this framework offers a practical approach for detecting early behavioral markers and supporting the identification of preclinical motor features of PD.",

      "title": "Fast-conducting mechanonociceptors uniquely engage reflexive and affective pain circuitry to drive protective responses",
      "content": "Nociceptors detect damaging stimuli and evoke pain in healthy animals. We conducted an optogenetic activation screen to identify genetically defined nociceptor populations that elicit place aversion and nocifensive behaviors in response to stimulation. Smr2Cre- and Bmpr1bCre-labeled A{delta} high-threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs) emerged as two of the few nociceptor populations, and we focused on investigating their physiological, morphological, functional, and synaptic properties. These neurons densely innervate skin and other organs, are activated only by intense, potentially damaging stimuli, and are necessary for protective responses to sharp mechanical stimuli. Centrally, A{delta}-HTMRs projections span multiple spinal segments and terminate across spinal cord laminae, forming strong, monosynaptic connections onto anterolateral tract projection neurons, including antenna cells of the deep dorsal horn. A{delta}-HTMRs also engage a local spinal reflex circuit enabling a remarkably rapid limb withdrawal. Thus, A{delta}-HTMRs are myelinated nociceptors with unique properties that can be exploited for development of new analgesics.",
