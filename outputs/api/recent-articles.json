      "title": "How are different contrast effects on binocular luster spatially integrated?",
      "content": "In previous studies with dichoptic center-ring-surround stimuli, we found that two properties of the ring element have a strong influence on the phenomenon of binocular luster. The strength of the lustrous impression in the central target patch varies with increasing ring width, with the direction of this variation (increasing or decreasing) depending on the ring's luminance. In this study, we used stimuli in which the ring was split into segments with two different luminances that in uniform rings had opposite effects on perceived luster. The aim was to investigate how the lustrous impression is influenced by combining a weaker and a stronger contrast effect, in particular how they are spatially integrated by the visual system. In a psychophysical matching experiment, subjects had to assess the strength of the lustrous impression in a series of test stimuli with different ring widths, numbers of ring segments, and spatial proportions between the two ring parts. We found that the results of the experiment could neither be explained by a winner-takes-all integration (assuming that the lustrous response is completely determined by the stronger effect) nor by a balanced integration process (assuming equal weights for the two effects). Instead, both effects contribute to the overall lustrous response, with the stronger effect having a greater weight. Interestingly, the magnitude of this weight varied considerably between different groups of subjects. We found two main trends in the data, representing two different types of sensitivity to the phenomenon of binocular luster.",

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",
