      "title": "Thalamic Interictal Epileptic and Non-Epileptic Events during NREM Sleep in Patients with Focal Epilepsy: a Stereo-EEG Study",
      "content": "Background: Thalamic recordings are increasingly incorporated into stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) evaluations of drug-resistant focal epilepsy to guide neuromodulation targeting. Human thalamic electrophysiology, however, is poorly defined, limiting the distinction between pathological and physiological activity. Here, we characterized interictal epileptic and non-epileptic events during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep across multiple thalamic nuclei and examined their relationship to seizure outcomes. Methods: We analyzed NREM sleep SEEG recordings from 64 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Electrodes sampled four thalamic nuclei: centromedian (CM), pulvinar (Pu), ventral lateral (VL), and ventral posterolateral (VPL). Patients were classified into three outcome groups: favorable, unfavorable, and surgically non-remediable. Rates of thalamic spikes, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spike-fast activity, and sleep spindles were analyzed and compared across nuclei and outcomes. Findings: Recordings of the thalamus revealed both pathological and physiological interictal events. Interictal epileptic events were infrequent. Only ~0.2% of seizure-onset zone spikes propagated to the thalamus. Thalamic spike-fast activity was indicative of unfavorable outcomes (CM: p = 0.047, d = 0.46) or surgically non-remediable epilepsy (VL: p = 0.002, d = 0.84). In contrast, thalamic sleep spindles were ubiquitous but reduced in surgically non-remediable patients (CM: p = 0.031, d = -0.58; VL: p = 0.005, d = -0.79). Finally, unique thalamic SEEG patterns were identified, including spikes concomitant with spindles, isolated spikes, and physiological fast ripples. Interpretation: This study provides a comprehensive characterization of thalamic interictal events during NREM sleep, enriching our understanding of thalamic pathophysiology and highlighting the value of thalamic recordings in pre-surgery evaluation.",

      "title": "Experiences are encoded by brainwide reprogramming of synaptome architecture",
      "content": "Synaptome architecture describes the spatiotemporal distribution of highly diverse excitatory synapses throughout the brain. Whether and how this architecture is impacted by experience is key to understanding its role in learning and memory. We found that environmental enrichment and monocular visual deprivation drive large-scale, type- and subtype-specific reorganisation of excitatory synapses in more than one hundred brain regions. Each experience modifies distinct subsets of synapses, with patterns aligned with protein turnover rates and connectome architecture. These reorganisations occur during development and adulthood, revealing a conserved mechanism of synaptome plasticity across the lifespan. Our findings support a population-selection model in which experience drives adaptation by selectively modifying synapse varieties, generating a distributed trace of past experiences. Our results also point to synaptome architecture as a shared framework integrating experience, lifespan changes, sleep, genetic variation and disease.",

      "title": "Axonal growth of cortical neurons does not require paxillin",
      "content": "Axon growth is an essential cellular process during neural development, and its dysregulation contributes to numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. During axon growth, extracellular signals direct neurons to extend projections that connect with their synaptic targets. Paxillin is a key member of adhesion sites that control motility by linking the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. Paxillin also binds to the cytoskeletal protein, tubulin. However, little is known about the role of adhesion proteins in neurons. Here, we use conditional paxillin knockout mice to investigate how loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons affects developing neuron morphology. Surprisingly, loss of paxillin in pyramidal cortical neurons caused no change in axon length or soma area between control (PxnF/F) and conditional paxillin knockout (PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre) mice at basal conditions. Following brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulation, the loss of paxillin resulted in no change in soma area or axonal {beta}-tubulin levels, but did result in a significant increase in axon length, as compared to control. Finally, the corpus callosum size was not significantly different between PxnF/F and PxnF/F; Emx1-Cre animals. In summary, these data suggest that paxillin is not required for axonal growth during neural development.",

      "title": "Aperiodic Activity Reflects Pathologic Waveform Shapes in Focal Epilepsy",
      "content": "<p>Epilepsy constitutes a clinically manifest excitability disorder that is characterized by aberrant electrophysiological activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The correct identification of the seizure onset zone relies on the visual detection of pathological waveforms and the assessment of their morphology, rhythmicity, and density. Recent advances in quantitative EEG analyses indicated that aperiodic EEG background activity might provide complementary information to traditional qualitative methods. Importantly, aperiodic activity, and specifically the slope of the 1/f<i><sup></sup></i> decay function of the power spectrum, might constitute a biomarker of the underlying population excitability dynamics. Hence, in the context of epileptic activity, an altered spectral slope is often considered as a signature of pathological excitability. To date, it remained unclear if this straightforward interpretation also applies to states of manifest seizure activity. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) during focal seizures from patients diagnosed with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (18 patients, 11 females). The results demonstrate that the spectral slope successfully delineates seizure activity. However, the spectral slope was sensitive to the presence and waveform shape of distinct epileptic components. By combining iEEG recordings with simulations, we demonstrate that epileptic spiking activity and associated slow-wave components differentially impact spectral slope estimates. These results offer a more parsimonious explanation for the biophysical origins of aperiodic activity as compared with the concept of an underlying balance between excitation and inhibition.</p>",
