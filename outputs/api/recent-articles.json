      "title": "Brain function in language and associated networks in non- or minimally verbal children",
      "content": "Language is universal in humans, develops robustly in infancy, and is rarely absent entirely in aphasia following strokes. Non- or minimally verbal children, in whom language has not developed by school-age in either production or comprehension, thus provide an unparalleled window into the human brain when it is deprived of language function. Yet insights from functional MRI are absent. Here we report results from a first study of intrinsic connectivity in 9 non- or minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (nvASD) scanned under sedation with propofol along with 8 typically developing children (scanned awake), using resting-state (rs) fMRI. We targeted both functional (FC) and anatomically constrained, generative effective connectivity (GEC) in the speech and language networks, the insula and associated networks, and the hippocampus. Identical analyses were applied to an independent rsMRI dataset of healthy adults scanned both under propofol and while awake, to evaluate sedation confounds. NvASDs compared to their neurotypical peers showed a widespread pattern of hypoconnectivity in auditory speech perception, frontotemporal, and semantic processing regions, which extended further to the insula, and the hippocampus. GEC results selectively replicated these patterns, which correlated with autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) behavioral scores within the nvASD group. This hypoconnectivity pattern extended neither to the adults scanned under propofol, nor to the visual cortex used as control region in nvASD, suggesting that this pattern of results could not be explained by sedation. Together, this first evidence from intrinsic connectivity reveals a broad pattern of underconnectivity across key cognitive networks, which provides a neural correlate for the significant breakdown of language-related cognitive functions in this population.",

      "title": "PKM\u03b6-PKC{iota}/{lambda} double-knockout reveals the atypical PKCs are crucial for hippocampal late-LTP and spatial long-term memory",
      "content": "PKM{zeta}, a persistently active, atypical PKC (aPKC) isoform, maintains enduring long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory in wild-type (WT) mice; however, hippocampal LTP and memory in PKM{zeta}-knockout ({zeta}-KO) mice are maintained by compensation. Although {zeta}-KO eliminates neocortical LTP, hippocampal LTP may be sustained by another aPKC, {iota}/{lambda} (PKC{iota}). PKC{iota} is critical for the generation of an early phase of LTP and short-term memory, and its genetic deletion is compensated by PKM{zeta}. Using a double knockout strategy, deleting both PKC{iota} and PKM{zeta} ({iota}/{zeta}-dKO) in hippocampus, we report that {iota}/{zeta}-dKO eliminates enduring LTP and spatial long-term memory but shows an early-phase, short-lasting LTP and short-term memory. ZIP, an inhibitor of both PKM{zeta} and PKC{iota} that disrupts LTP in WT and PKM{zeta}-null hippocampus, does not affect LTP in {iota}/{zeta}-dKO hippocampus, suggesting ZIP disrupts LTP by targeting PKM{zeta} or PKC{iota}. Thus, the double-KO reveals that additional compensatory short-term processes can be induced without aPKCs, whereas additional long-term processes cannot. We conclude that PKM{zeta}, under normal conditions, and PKC{iota} as an essential back-up are crucial for the persistence of hippocampal LTP and spatial memory.",

      "content": "In order to understand the constantly changing acoustic world our brains must maintain elements of auditory scenes in memory. The neural mechanisms for this fundamental process remain unclear. Here, we report human intracranial recordings of 1269 single neurons, recorded from various brain structures while participants performed a non-verbal auditory working memory task that required adjusting a tone frequency to match a target. We found neurons within regions including hippocampus, insula and cingulate cortex, for which firing rates were modulated at various phases of the task, particularly throughout maintenance and during active tone adjustment. For the majority of the neurons modulated during maintenance, relative to baseline, there was a striking suppression of activity rather than increased activity, though response types were heterogeneous both within and between regions. Across the entire neuronal population, state-space analyses demonstrated that the different task phases were clearly separable. Behaviorally, there was an increased number of neurons were modulated at the beginning of the maintenance phase when participants performed better. These data support the existence of a distributed neural code for auditory working memory that determines related behavior.",

      "title": "Time- and frequency-resolved decomposition of beta brain activity reveals two functionally distinct beta bands",
      "content": "Oscillatory brain activity in the beta (13-30 Hz) range plays a central role in sensorimotor and other healthy brain processes and is a potential disease biomarker. However, even in the well-studied sensorimotor system, inconsistencies remain concerning beta's differential role in maintaining and terminating movement. Emerging evidence suggests that beta comprises two frequency ranges, a lower (<20 Hz) and a higher (>20 Hz) subrange. Moreover, beta occurs in transient 'events' which correlate with perception and action. We here use human whole-brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and a Hidden Markov Model based analysis approach to discover whole-brain beta-band activity during rest and a naturalistic motor task in a data-driven manner. We successfully delineate two anatomically and functionally distinct beta band components which coexist throughout the neocortex. Low-beta (<20 Hz) events are very rare, high amplitude events, whereas high-beta (>20 Hz) is common but lower in amplitude. Both bands show state-specific anatomical distribution and modulation during a motor task: Low-beta is entirely absent during movement, whereas high-beta is only partially suppressed and reoccurs during postural maintenance. During post-movement beta rebound, low-beta event probability increases threefold, accompanied by strong low-beta event synchronization. A third state, probably corresponding to gamma activity, is active during task execution. Beta rebound occurs via a directed, sequential shift from gamma/active state via high-beta state to low-beta state. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for the coexistence of two functionally and anatomically distinct beta bands, and provide insights into their role in movement initiation, maintenance, and termination.",

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
