      "title": "Foundation Model for Advancing Healthcare: Challenges, Opportunities and Future Directions",
      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "title": "Dynamic updating of cognitive maps via traces of experience in the subiculum",
      "content": "In the classical view of hippocampal function, the subiculum is assigned the role as the output layer. In spatial paradigms, some subiculum neurons manifest as so-called boundary vector cells (BVCs), firing in response to boundaries at specific allocentric directions and distances. More recently it has been shown that some subiculum BVCs can be classified as vector trace cells (VTCs), which exhibit traces of activity after a boundary/object has been removed. Here we propose a model of processing within subiculum that accounts for VTCs, taking into account proximodistal differences in subiculum (pSub vs dSub) and CA1. dSub neurons receive feedforward input, either in the form of perceptual information (from BVCs in pSub) or mnemonic information (from place cells in CA1). Mismatch between these two inputs updates associative memory encoded in the synapses between CA1 and dSub. With a range of learning rates, the model captures the majority of experimental findings, including the distribution of VTCs along the proximodistal axis, the percentage of VTCs across different cue types, and the hours-long persistence of the vector trace. Incorporating experimentally reported effects of inserted objects/rewards on place cells (place field shift), we also explain why VTCs have longer tuning distances after cue removal. This adds predictive character to subiculum traces and suggests the online use of mnemonic content during navigation. Our model suggests that mismatch detection for updating spatial memory content provides a mechanistic explanation for findings in the CA1-subiculum pathway. This work constitutes the first dedicated circuit-level model of computation within the subiculum, consistent with known effects in CA1, and provides a potential framework to extend the canonical model of hippocampal function with a subiculum component.",

      "title": "Neural Receptive Fields, Stimulus Space Embedding and Effective Geometry of Scale-Free Networks",
      "content": "Understanding how neuronal dynamics couple with stimuli space and how receptive fields emerge and organize within brain networks remains a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Several models attempted to explain these phenomena, often by adjusting the network to empirical manifestations, but struggled to achieve biological plausibility. Here, we propose a physiologically grounded model in which receptive fields and population-level attractor dynamics emerge naturally from the effective hyperbolic geometry of scale-free networks. In particular, we associate stimulus space with the boundary of a hyperbolic embedding, and study the resulting neural dynamics in both rate-based and spiking implementations. The resulting localized attractors faithfully reflect the structure of the stimulus space and capture key properties of the receptive fields without fine-tuning of local connectivity, exhibiting a direct relation between a neuron's connectivity degree and the corresponding receptive field size. The model generalizes to stimulus spaces of arbitrary dimensionality and scale, encompassing various modalities, such as orientation and place selectivity. We also provide direct experimental evidence in support of these results, based on analyses of hippocampal place fields recorded on a linear track. Overall, our framework offers a novel organizing principle for receptive field formation and establishes a direct link between network structure, stimulus space encoding, and neural dynamics.",

      "content": "Much of our interaction with the world relies on the ability to move our limbs with speed and precision. The cerebellum is critical for movement coordination, yet how outputs from the cerebellum continually guide the limb and whether discrete pathways differentially contribute to adjusting motor output remain unclear. Using intersectional viral approaches in mice, we identify two spatially intermingled yet anatomically distinct cerebellar populations that drive the forelimb either toward or away from the body. Neural recordings reveal cerebellar activity that correlates with and precedes these opposing directional changes in limb movement. Both cerebellar output pathways influence motor neuron and muscle activity within milliseconds, producing reliable effects on limb trajectory despite substantial underlying variability in muscle recruitment patterns. Our findings disentangle a subtype organization to cerebellar limb control, revealing a subcortical circuit basis for online directional refinement during movement execution.",

      "title": "Multimodal MR Imaging for quantification of brain lipid in mice at 9.4T",
      "content": "Background: Advanced MR imaging techniques like steady state Nuclear Overhauser enhancement (ssNOE), transient NOE (tNOE), and myelin water fraction (MWF) provide a non-invasive way to assess the biochemical and structural integrity of brain tissue. Their sensitivity to endogenous lipids and macromolecules allows for the early detection of neuropathological changes, making them valuable tools in studying brain health and disease progression. In this study, we systematically evaluate the repeatability and sensitivity of NOEMTR, tNOE, and MWF for quantifying lipid and myelin content in the brains of wild-type (WT) mice, correlating the results with immunohistochemistry (IHC). Methods: Five 6-month-old C57BL6/J mice were imaged using 3D-NOE, and four mice underwent imaging with 2D tNOE and MWF across four repeated sessions using a 9.4T Scanner. For ssNOE imaging, CEST-weighted images at 56 frequency offsets were acquired using B1rms of 1.0 T and 3s saturation duration. For tNOE, 52 offsets were acquired with a hyperbolic secant inversion pulse (bandwidth = 400Hz, duration = 44ms) and a mixing time of 200ms. For MWF, a multi-echo spin-echo (MESE) sequence was acquired with 40 evenly spaced echoes from 5.5ms to 200ms. For both ssNOE and tNOE, B0 correction was performed using WASSR. Repeatability was quantified using intra- and inter-subject coefficients of variation (COV%). Pearson correlation was performed to see the association between imaging matrices and IHC measures, Luxol fast blue (LFB) stained sections, and myelin basic protein (MBP). Results: All techniques demonstrated high repeatability across the whole brain (WB) and selected regions of interest (ROIs). Whole-brain intra-subject COV% for NOEMTR ranged from 1.92% to 3.40%, with corresponding inter-subject COVs of 1.50%. tNOE exhibited improved intra-subject repeatability with COVs ranging from 0.75% to 5.57%, but a reduced inter-subject COV of 2.97%. MWF imaging showed the highest stability overall, with an intra-subject COV ranging from 0.47% to 2.03% and an inter-subject COV of 0.75%. Visually, tNOE offers superior contrast in myelin-rich areas compared to NOEMTR and MWF imaging, showing greater sensitivity to myelinated regions. tNOE strongly correlates with histological markers: r = 0.83 with MBP staining and r = 0.72 with LFB staining (both p < 0.001). MWF and NOEMTR showed correlations with MBP (r = 0.63 and r = 0.57, respectively). Conclusion: NOEMTR, tNOE, and MWF imaging are reliable and repeatable methods for quantifying macromolecules in the brain. Among these, tNOE emerges as the most sensitive for detecting myelin lipids as confirmed by histological validation. These findings highlight the translational potential of tNOE for studying demyelinating disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

      "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "Closed-loop coupling of both physiological spindle model and spinal pathways for sensorimotor control of human center-out reaching",
      "content": "The development of new studies that consider different structures of the hierarchical sensorimotor control system is essential to enable a more holistic understanding about movement. The incorporation of more biological proprioceptive and neuronal circuit models to muscles can turn neuromusculoskeletal systems more appropriate to investigate and elucidate motor control. Specifically, further studies that consider the closed-loop between proprioception and central nervous system may allow to better understand the yet open question about the importance of afferent feedback for sensorimotor learning and execution in the intact biological system. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the processing of spindle afferent firings by spiking neuronal network and their relevance for sensorimotor control. We integrated our previously published physiological model of the muscle spindle in a biological arm model, corresponding to a musculoskeletal system able to reproduce biological motion inside of the demoa multi-body simulation framework. We coupled this musculoskeletal system to physiologically-motivated neuronal spinal pathways, which were implemented based on literature in the NEST spiking neural network simulator, intended to perform human center-out reaching arising from spinal synaptic learning. As result, the spindle connections to the spinal neurons were strengthened for the more difficult targets (i.e. higher above placed targets) under perturbation, highlighting the importance of spindle proprioception to succeed in more difficult scenarios. Furthermore, an additionally-implemented simpler spinal network (that does not include the pathways with spindle proprioception) presented an inferior performance in the task by not being able to reach all the evaluated targets.",

      "content": "The brain's faculty to assimilate and retain information, continually updating its memory while limiting the loss of valuable past knowledge, remains largely a mystery. We address this challenge related to continuous learning in the context of associative memory networks, where the sequential storage of correlated patterns typically requires non-local learning rules or external memory systems. Our work demonstrates how incorporating biologically inspired inhibitory plasticity enables networks to autonomously explore their attractor landscape. The algorithm presented here allows for the autonomous retrieval of stored patterns, enabling the progressive incorporation of correlated memories. This mechanism is reminiscent of memory consolidation during sleep-like states in the mammalian central nervous system. The resulting framework provides insights into how neural circuits might maintain memories through purely local interactions and takes a step forward toward a more biologically plausible mechanism for memory rehearsal and continuous learning.",

      "title": "Quantitative prediction of intracellular dynamics and synaptic currents in a small neural circuit",
      "content": "Fitting models to experimental intracellular data is challenging. While detailed conductance-based models are difficult to train, phenomenological statistical models often fail to capture the rich intrinsic dynamics of circuits such as central pattern generators (CPGs). A recent trend has been to employ tools from deep learning to obtain data-driven models that can quantitatively learn intracellular dynamics from experimental data. This paper addresses the general questions of modeling, training, and interpreting a large class of such models in the context of estimating the dynamics of a neural circuit. In particular, we use recently introduced Recurrent Mechanistic Models to predict the dynamics of a Half-Center Oscillator (HCO), a type of CPG. We construct the HCO by interconnecting two neurons in the Stomatogastric Ganglion using the dynamic clamp experimental protocol. This allows us to gather ground truth synaptic currents, which the model is able to predict\u2013even though these currents are not used during training. We empirically assess the speed and performance of the training methods of teacher forcing, multiple shooting, and generalized teacher forcing, which we present in a unified fashion tailored to data-driven models with explicit membrane voltage variables. From a theoretical perspective, we show that a key contraction condition in data-driven dynamics guarantees the applicability of these training methods. We also show that this condition enables the derivation of data-driven frequency-dependent conductances, making it possible to infer the excitability profile of a real neuronal circuit using a trained model.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
