      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, has reported an ongoing outbreak of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC). Phage therapy is a promising strategy to treat antimicrobial-resistant infections. Utilizing the hospital's isolate collection, built over the past decade, we established an initial 3-phage cocktail with 54% ECC coverage. We then iteratively improved this product by enhancing phage killing efficiency using phage adaptation and expanded host...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Uveitis secondary to chronic autoimmune disease, such as ALPS, offer long-term challenges for ocular health management. Due to the recurrent nature of uveitis flares in patients with ALPS, long-term ophthalmic and systemic management may be warranted with low-dose maintenance topical corticosteroid or systemic immunomodulation. Response to topical and systemic therapy can be highly patient specific. Complex side effect profiles of many systemic immunotherapies make drug tolerability...",

The presentation of conjunctival melanoma varies and should be clinically differentiated from an array of ocular surface pigmented and nonpigmented lesions. Mutations in the oncogenes BRAF (V600E) and NRAS, and the tumor suppressor gene NF1, are associated with worse survival. UV signature mutations are frequently...",
