      "content": "CONCLUSION: Despite demonstrating adaptability, individuals with VI in T\u00fcrkiye face significant structural barriers to equitable AT access. Informal learning limited public support, and a lack of locally adapted tools contribute to digital exclusion. A rights-based approach-emphasizing inclusive funding, institutionalized training, localized AT development, and policy accountability-is essential to creating an inclusive technological and social environment.",

      "content": "OBJECTIVE: SSVEP-based BCI spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or...",

      "content": "Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG...",
