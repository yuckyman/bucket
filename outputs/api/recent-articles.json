      "title": "SCREWx: A Screwless, Chronic, Recoverable, and Lightweight Neuropixels fixture for freely-moving rodents",
      "content": "High-density Neuropixels probes enable the study of large neural populations with single-cell and sub-millisecond resolution. While single-probe and acute head-fixed experiments have yielded critical scientific insights, understanding the neural mechanisms underlying many complex behaviors requires simultaneous multi-region recordings in freely moving, chronically implanted animals. Various probe fixtures have been developed to enable high-density recording, but existing designs impose critical limitations: their substantial weight restricts the maximum probe count that smaller animals can support, their bulky dimensions constrain the proximity of targeted brain regions, and their complex assembly risks damaging the probe during insertion and recovery. In this paper, we present a lightweight, fully 3D-printable, compact, and screwless fixture for chronic Neuropixels implants in freely moving rodents that features simple mechanisms for stable implantation and safe extraction. Our fixture design enables stable, high-yield single-unit recordings for months-long experiments, along with an 83% successful probe extraction rate. This fixture design provides a robust and accessible solution for long-term, multi-probe chronic Neuropixels recordings, increasing experimental throughput and enabling more complex experimental designs to investigate brain-wide neural dynamics.",

      "content": "Live sport spectatorship can promote social connection, yet scalable, low-burden strategies to strengthen bonding in real-world spectator settings remain limited. We here tested the hypothesis that co-consuming sparkling water during spectating attenuates hunger and fatigue and strengthens enjoyment and perceived unity, potentially via HR synchrony linked to oxytocin dynamics. In an individually randomized field experiment at a collegiate women basketball home game (sparkling water: n = 21; plain water: n = 19), spectators consumed 200 mL of sparkling water or plain water in synchrony before tip-off and before the end of halftime, with additional ad libitum intake of the assigned beverage permitted thereafter. We assessed acute freshness and hunger, repeated fatigue and enjoyment, interpersonal HR synchrony from the first half to 15-min post-game, perceived unity toward players and fellow spectators, and salivary oxytocin levels. Relative to plain water, sparkling water increased freshness and reduced hunger after intake, attenuated post-game fatigue, and enhanced enjoyment and perceived unity. HR synchrony was preserved in association with attenuated post-game fatigue after the game, and sustained synchrony was associated with higher perceived unity. Oxytocin decreased more in the sparkling-water group, and this decrease was associated with preserved HR synchrony as well as with changes in unity toward fellow fans. These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that co-consuming sparkling water serves as an alcohol-free, low-burden ritual to enhance social connection during and after live sport events.",

      "title": "Long-lasting astrocyte remodeling in Dravet Syndrome Scn1a+/- mouse model.",
      "content": "Background. Dravet syndrome (DS) is a prototypical developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by SCN1A gene mutations leading to NaV1.1 loss of function. The latter causes early-onset drug-resistant seizures and enduring cognitive and behavioral deficits. In this pathological context, the implication of astrocytes remains insufficiently explored. Methods. Using a heterozygous Scn1a knock-out (Scn1a+/-) mouse model that recapitulates the DS-human phenotype, we examine astrocyte remodeling at landmark disease stages, as defined by video-EEG and behavioral read-outs. Results. From initial disease aggravation (PN20-35) to long-term stabilization (up to PN90), Scn1a+/- mice showed increased hippocampal and cortical GFAP transcript and protein levels, compared to age-matched control littermates and to an earlier pre-symptomatic (<PN20) time point. During the aggravation phase in Scn1a+/- mice, astrocyte branching, revealed by GFAP histological analysis and by intracellular delivery of Alexa Fluor 488 in hippocampal slices was increased but not sustained long-term. These disease-stage-dependent astrocyte modifications were not associated with macroscopic hippocampal sclerosis or cortical atrophy. To further study astrocyte remodeling during disease progression, we used biocytin diffusion following single-astrocyte loading to reveal an expanded astrocyte-astrocyte network in Scn1a+/- mice long-term, along with increased Cx30 and Cx43 protein levels. An ethidium bromide uptake assay indicated impaired astrocytic hemichannel function in Scn1a+/- mice long-term. Regionally, these long-term cellular and network astrocyte modifications coincided with augmented post-tetanic synaptic potentiation. Discussion. In DS, astrocytes undergo a long-lasting network remodeling. We discuss how this astrocyte remodeling may be related to seizures as well as synaptic and cognitive deficits.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",
