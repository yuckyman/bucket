      "title": "PyPDFForm v4.1.1 has released",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Happy new year <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>! It's been a bit over half a year since the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ljas6t/pypdfform_v300_has_released/\">last post</a> I made about PyPDFForm. As the project starts its sixth year of development, I'd like to update you with a handful (yet not a complete list) of new features that have been introduced in the last 7 months, some of which were requested by the exact fellow redditors of you guys:</p> <ol> <li>Performance! Yes I know people mock Python for its performance, but that doesn't stop us from writing faster code. A number of PyPDFForm's old, not performant APIs, for example create form fields, are deprecated/removed and replaced by their more performant equivalencies. Now it should be faster to do things with PyPDFForm, especially in bulk.</li> <li>Thanks to qpdf, the project now has even better appearance handling ability, making it capable of generating at least ASCII based text appearances for single line text fields. This is rather significant because not all PDF viewers have bulitin appearance generation functionality. In the case when one doesn't, PyPDFForm now offers a fallback.</li> <li>You can draw more types of elements on a PDF. On top of the already supported texts and images, you can now draw different shapes such as line segments, rectangles, circles, and ellipses, with some starter level of styling you could customize for each. I plan on continuously expand this feature so that we can have more elements to draw and more styling to customize in the future.</li> <li>The <a href=\"https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/v4.1/\">docs site</a> has been revamped, it was completely rebuilt using the Material for MkDocs theme. Previously it was just using the default Read the Docs theme that came with MkDocs. While it's simple and minimal, it lacked critical features for what I consider a production ready project's documentation. With the new theme, you should have a much better time navigating through the docs with better syntax highlighting, searching, layouts, etc. Also the docs site is now versioned, as it should for a long time.</li> <li>You can now embed JavaScript code into form fields using PyPDFForm. This is a beta feature that just got rolled out in v4.1. The reason it's beta is that...it may not be secure, and I debated for a while whether to offer this or not. I decided to do so because in the end, you could always do it, and PyPDFForm is just making it simpler. So if all things go well, you can use JavaScript to make your PDF forms more dynamic with your own creativity.</li> <li>To further prove the level of dynamic you could achieve with PyPDFForm, I spent this past weekend hacked together a POC project which, <a href=\"https://github.com/chinapandaman/pdf-tic-tac-toe\">literally lets you play Tic-tac-toe on a PDF form</a>.</li> </ol> <p>If you find this interesting, feel free to checkout the project's <a href=\"https://github.com/chinapandaman/PyPDFForm\">GitHub repo</a>, its <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/PyPDFForm/\">PyPi page</a>, and its <a href=\"https://chinapandaman.github.io/PyPDFForm/\">documentation</a>. And like always, I hope you guys find the library helpful for your own PDF generation workflow. Feel free to try it, test it, leave comments or suggestions, and open issues. And of course if you are willing, kindly give me a star on GitHub (I'm INCHES away from 1k stars so do it :D).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chinapandaman\"> /u/chinapandaman </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4n4yd/pypdfform_v411_has_released/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4n4yd/pypdfform_v411_has_released/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What My Project Does:</p> <p><strong>AmzPy</strong> is a Python library designed to scrape Amazon product details and search results without needing official PA-API access.</p> <p>It specifically solves the common &quot;bot detection&quot; issue by using <code>curl_cffi</code> for browser impersonation. Instead of standard <code>requests</code>, it mimics the TLS/JA3 fingerprints of real browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox), making it much harder for Amazon to block your requests.</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/theonlyanil/amzpy\">https://github.com/theonlyanil/amzpy</a></p> <p><strong>PyPI:</strong> <code>pip install amzpy</code></p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This is intended for <strong>developers and data researchers</strong> who need to build MVPs, price trackers, or affiliate tools but have been denied Amazon PA-API access or find the official API's limitations too restrictive for early-stage development.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Vs. Official PA-API:</strong> Doesn't require manual approval or maintaining a specific sales volume to keep your keys active.</li> <li><strong>Vs. Scrapy/BeautifulSoup:</strong> Standard scrapers often get hit with CAPTCHAs immediately. AmzPy uses <code>curl_cffi</code> to bypass these hurdles natively. PLUS, amzpy handles beautifulsoup stuff well.</li> <li><strong>Vs. Selenium/Playwright:</strong> AmzPy is much lighter and faster as it doesn't require spinning up a full headless browser instance.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Basic Usage:</strong></p> <pre><code>from amzpy import AmazonScraper scraper = AmazonScraper(country_code=&quot;in&quot;) products = scraper.search_products(query=&quot;gaming mouse&quot;, max_pages=1) for item in products: print(f&quot;{item['title']} - {item['price']}&quot;) </code></pre> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on my library...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/convicted_redditor\"> /u/convicted_redditor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4i3yu/amzpy_an_amazon_scraper_born_out_of_api/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q4i3yu/amzpy_an_amazon_scraper_born_out_of_api/\">[comments]</a></span>",
