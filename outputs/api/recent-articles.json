      "content": "OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform medical informatics by supporting clinical decision-making, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving workflows and efficiency. However, successful integration of AI-based decision support systems depends on careful consideration of human-AI collaboration, trust, skill maintenance, and automation bias. This work proposes five central questions to guide future research in medical informatics and human-computer interface...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Infratentorial stroke patients with dysphagia exhibit disrupted functional connectivity within the fronto-temporo-sensorimotor network, which is associated with clinical impairment. Tongue Tri-needle multi-stage, selective reconfiguration of brain functional networks, particularly by modulating the right DLPFC, a key hub, to promote functional integration of swallow-related neural networks. These findings provide a neuromodulatory mechanism supporting the use of Tongue Tri-needle for...",

Guided by mutual prediction theory, we investigated how temporal structure and effector-specific constraints shape dyadic coordination. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we recorded inter-brain activity from pairs of participants performing a synchronization-continuation tapping task. The task included three types of...",
