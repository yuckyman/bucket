      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "State-dependent filtering as a mechanism toward visual robustness",
      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "title": "GM1-oligosaccharide rescues rotenone-impaired neuronal polarization through RhoA/ROCK modulation and mitochondrial protection",
      "content": "Neuronal polarization is a fundamental process in the formation of functional neural circuits, relying on the precise coordination between cytoskeletal regulatory signals and mechanisms that sustain cellular integrity. Disruption of these processes compromises neuronal differentiation and survival, and various neurotoxic compounds, including certain pesticides, have been associated with such dysfunctions. In this context, identifying molecules that counteract these detrimental effects is of significant therapeutic interest. Neuronal polarization is essential for the establishment of functional neural circuits and relies on coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, RhoA/ROCK signaling, and mitochondrial function. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorestorative potential of the ganglioside GM1 and its oligosaccharide derivative, osGM1, in primary hippocampal pyramidal neurons exposed to the mitochondrial neurotoxin rotenone. Rotenone induced a marked arrest of neuronal development, impaired axonal elongation, and disrupted mitochondrial organization and membrane potential. Both GM1 and osGM1 promoted recovery of neuronal polarity and axonal growth, exerting protective and restorative effects even under continuous toxin exposure, with osGM1 showing superior efficacy. Notably, osGM1 also reversed axonal growth deficits caused by pathological actin stabilization. Mechanistically, osGM1 normalized rotenone-induced hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway without altering basal signaling and partially restored mitochondrial network integrity and function. Collectively, these findings identify osGM1 as a multi-target modulator of cytoskeletal and mitochondrial dysfunction and support its translational potential as a therapeutic strategy to counteract neurotoxin-induced neuronal damage.",

      "title": "A mouse model of CHCHD10 p.R15L familial ALS presents mild, age-related motor neuron degeneration without protein instability or mitochondrial dysfunction",
      "content": "Mutations in the mitochondrial protein CHCHD10 (D10) cause a spectrum of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders. Among these, the p.R15L variant is linked to a slowly progressive, late-onset familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with unclear pathogenic mechanisms. To better understand this, we investigated a knock-in (KI) mouse model carrying the p.R15L mutation in the endogenous protein. Unlike previously described mutant D10 KI models, p.R15L KI mice exhibited normal D10 protein levels, with no evidence of large protein aggregates. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide emission in mitochondria isolated from muscle and brain were unaltered. Similarly, fibroblasts from human p.R15L carriers exhibited normal D10 levels and unchanged oxidative phosphorylation function. Histochemical analyses of p.R15L KI muscle revealed mild increases in mitochondrial enzymatic activity in a subset of muscle fibers and muscle transcriptomics showed elevated expression of PGC-1, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. p.R15L KI mice developed subtle, late-onset phenotypes, including reduced body weight and motor activity and increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, in aged mice electrophysiological studies demonstrated decreased amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, commensurate with a moderate loss of spinal cord motor neurons and elevated serum neurofilament light levels, indicative of neurodegeneration. Together, these results indicate that the p.R15L mutation produces a mild, late-onset motor neuron phenotype in mice, partially recapitulating the human disease, without mitochondrial functional or morphological alterations. The findings indicate that p.R15L D10 selectively impairs mouse motor neurons through a gain-of-function mechanism, providing a genetically accurate yet mild in vivo model of familial ALS.",

      "content": "Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability, yet the mechanisms disrupting fetal brain development remain unclear. We performed single cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling of approximately 250,000 cells from 15 DS and 15 control human fetal cortices (10 to 20 weeks post-conception). Our analysis revealed a subtype-specific reduction in RORB/FOXP1 expressing excitatory neurons and widespread disruption of neurodevelopmental transcriptional programs. Chromosome 21 transcription factors BACH1, PKNOX1, and GABPA emerged as dosage-sensitive hubs regulating genes linked to intellectual disability. Antisense oligonucleotide mediated normalization of these factors in human neural progenitors in vitro partially rescued target gene expression. Benchmarking a humanized in vivo model captured additional molecular and cellular signatures of DS, complementing the in vitro model. Together, this resource defines the gene regulatory landscape underlying cortical development in DS and highlights candidate molecular targets and preclinical models for further investigation.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe assessment of gender perception influenced by ambiguous facial cues in patients requiring emergency medical attention remains ambiguous. Pareidolia faces represent unconscious errors in facial recognition, wherein a wide array of visual attributes contribute to the interpretation of facial features. This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

      "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
      "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",
