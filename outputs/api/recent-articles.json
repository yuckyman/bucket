      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "title": "A study on the dreams of Miao and Han college students in Guizhou Province.",
      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "The Oneiric Circle and the Misioneros del Temporal in Morelos, Mexico.",
      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "title": "SynTEF1 restores the functional disease phenotype of SCA27B in an hiPSC-derived neuronal disease model",
      "content": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia 27B (SCA27B), caused by a deep-intronic GAA-TTC repeat expansion in FGF14, has recently been identified as one of the most frequent genetic ataxias. Yet its underlying disease mechanism remains largely unknown, and disease-modifying treatments targeting upstream disease mechanisms are lacking. Here we hypothesized that (i) SCA27B is caused by transcriptional repression of FGF14, leading to reduced neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission strength; (ii) which can be restored by a synthetic elongation transcription factor (Syn-TEF1). We assessed FGF14 mRNA levels by qPCR, and neuronal function by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in network and autaptic cultures of SCA27B patient iPSC-derived NGN2-neurons. Change in all read-outs was then assessed also upon Syn-TEF1 treatment. FGF14 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in both heterozygous and biallelic SCA27B patient-derived neurons. This was associated with decreased neuronal excitability and decreased peak current density of voltage-gated sodium channels. Moreover, SCA27B neurons showed reduced synaptic transmission with decreased excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes. Treatment with SynTEF1 restored FGF14 mRNA levels, thereby restoring neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. These insights into SCA27B pathophysiology and its amelioration by SynTEF1 open new translational avenues for the development of disease-modifying gene-targeted therapies for SCA27B.",

      "title": "A scaffold attachment factor PHM-2 regulates synaptic transmission through SLO-2 potassium channel in C. elegans",
      "content": "Scaffold attachment factor B (SAFB) proteins are evolutionarily conserved DNA/RNA binding proteins that are involved in multiple processes of gene expression. These proteins are broadly expressed with particular high expression observed in the nervous system. However, their physiological roles in neurons are largely unclear. Here we show that PHM-2, the sole SAFB ortholog in C. elegans, regulates synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junctions through an effect on SLO-2 potassium channel. We found that phm-2 knockout suppresses a sluggish phenotype of worms expressing a hyperactive SLO-2 channel, greatly reduces SLO-2-mediated neuronal whole-cell currents, and enhances neuromuscular synaptic transmission. In addition, we found that PHM-2 genetically interacts with another DNA/RNA binding protein, HRPU-2/hnRNP U, to control SLO-2 expression through a posttranscriptional mechanism. These results reveal a novel function of a SAFB protein in regulating neuronal activity, and may help understand the physiological roles of SAFB proteins in the nervous system of other species.",
