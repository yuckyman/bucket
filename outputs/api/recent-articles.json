However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "Optimal configuration of on-scalp OPMs with fixed channel counts",
      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "Human gait identification is a biometric technique that permits recognizing an individual from a long distance focusing on numerous features such as movement, time, and clothing. This approach in particular is highly useful in video surveillance scenarios, where biometric systems allow people to be easily recognized without intruding on their privacy. In the domain of computer vision, one of the essential and most difficult tasks is tracking a person across multiple camera views, specifically,...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Moderate segmentation variability has a limited impact on model performance. Although incorporating peritumoral information may reduce feature reproducibility, it does not compromise predictive utility. Notably, feature stability is not a strict prerequisite for predictive relevance, highlighting that exclusive reliance on ICC or stability metrics for feature selection may inadvertently discard informative features.",

However, the similar morphology between field crops and weeds, complex occlusions, variable lighting conditions, and the diversity of target scales pose severe challenges to the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods on resource-constrained platforms. This study proposes a novel instance segmentation framework, CPD-WeedNet, specifically designed for...",
