      "title": "Accelerated rTMS for Enhancing Intact Cognition: An Examination of Dose Effects on Electrocortical Indicators of Attention and Working Memory",
      "content": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS Improvements in cognition (e.g., attention, working memory) are common after repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment and have also been observed in non-clinical samples. This study investigated whether rTMS can enhance cognitive resilience in individuals who perform in high-stress environments using cognitive measures and electroencephalography (EEG) to explore potential neural mechanisms of rTMS-induced cognitive change. METHODS 40 college-educated adults not reporting cognitive or psychiatric concerns underwent a 5-day accelerated (10 sessions/ day) rTMS treatment and pre-post cognitive assessment. Participants were assigned to 1 of 10 doses defined as number of active vs. sham stimulation sessions/ day (total active pulses = 3,000-30,000). To assess cognitive effects, standard batteries (NIH Toolbox, Spaceflight Cognitive Assessment Tool for Windows [WinSCAT]) were administered-and a subset (n=21) also did an N-Back working memory task with EEG measurement-before, immediately after, and 1 month after rTMS. For all indices, linear and quadratic correlations of pre-to-post-rTMS change with dose were examined to test if an optimal dose was achieved. RESULTS From pre- to post-rTMS, participants improved in fluid cognition (working memory, processing speed) as measured by NIH toolbox, t(39)=8.4, p<.001, d=1.3, and WinSCAT, t(39)=4.1, p<.001, d=.65; and, improvement in the latter related linearly to rTMS dose, r(39)=.40, p=.01. Regarding EEG, subjects who received high (6+ active sessions/day) also showed increased amplitudes of an event-related marker of stimulus-directed attention (P300) whether it was elicited by simple task targets, t(10)=3.1, p=.01, d=.95, or task-unrelated noise stimuli played during the task as probes of peripheral attention, t(10)=3.6, p=.005, d=1.1. Additionally, there were linear relationships between change magnitude and rTMS dose for simple task target-related, r(20)=.45, p=.04, and peripheral noise-related, r(20)=.54, p=.009, P300s. CONCLUSIONS rTMS improved fluid reasoning abilities and also changed how dynamic attention is deployed during high-demand challenges as a potential mediator of fluid cognition improvements. While linear dose-response relationships support that changes were rTMS-elicited, absence of a response curve asymptote also suggests that still-higher doses could be warranted to achieve maximal effects in non-clinical samples.",

      "title": "Gait adaptation to asymmetric foot-ground compliance applied by robotic footwear",
      "content": "Perturbing foot-ground interaction dynamics has shown promise for eliciting adaptations to inter-limb weight-bearing symmetry, a critical target for rehabilitation of asymmetrical neuromotor deficits affecting gait. To date, this perturbation paradigm has been delivered via adjustable stiffness treadmills, in which the treadmill deck displaces under the foot during the stance phase of gait. Recently, we developed robotic footwear capable of delivering asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations during walking, offering a portable experimental platform for asymmetrical ground stiffness perturbations, allowing it to be executed overground and on conventional treadmills. In this study, we quantified kinetic and spatio-temporal gait adaptation to a foot-ground compliance perturbation delivered by the novel robotic footwear. We found that participants shifted their vertical ground reaction force impulse, vertical pushoff peak, and peak braking force toward the unperturbed limb after the perturbation was removed, indicating a shift in neuromotor control elicited by the perturbation. We conclude that the robotic footwear can elicit weight bearing adaptations similar to adjustable stiffness treadmills, and that the dissipative mechanical properties of the shoes likely play a key role in the direction of the adaptation.",

      "title": "Spatial predictive coding in visual cortical neurons",
      "content": "Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that can explain how animals build internal models of their sensory environments by predicting sensory inputs. Predictive coding may capture either spatial or temporal relationships between sensory objects. While the original theory by Rao and Ballard, 1999 described spatial predictive coding, much of the recent experimental data has been interpreted as evidence for temporal predictive coding. Here we directly tested whether the \"mismatch\" neural responses in sensory cortex are due to a spatial or a temporal internal model. We adopted two common paradigms to study predictive coding: one based on virtual-reality and one based on static images. After training mice with repeated visual stimulation for several days, we performed multiple manipulations, including: 1) we introduced a novel stimulus, 2) we replaced a stimulus with a novel gray wall, 3) we duplicated a trained stimulus, or 4) we altered the order of the stimuli. The first two manipulations induced a substantial mismatch response in neural populations of up to 20,000 neurons recorded across primary and higher-order visual cortex, while the third and fourth ones did not. Thus, a mismatch response only occurred if a new spatial -- not temporal -- pattern was introduced.",

      "content": "In recent years, research on voice processing in the human brain - particularly the study of temporal voice areas (TVA) - was dedicated almost exclusively to conspecific vocalizations. To characterize commonalities and differences regarding primate vocalization representations in the human brain, the inclusion of closely related nonhuman primates - namely chimpanzees and bonobos - is needed. We hypothesized that neural commonalities would depend on both phylogenetic and acoustic proximities, with chimpanzees ranking closest to Homo. Presenting human participants (N=23) with the vocalizations of four primate species (rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans) and regressing-out relevant acoustic parameters using three distinct analyses, we observed within-TVA, sample-specific, bilateral anterior superior temporal gyrus activity for chimpanzee vocalizations compared to: all other species; nonhuman primates; human vocalizations. Within-TVA activity was also observed for macaque vocalizations. Our results provide evidence for subregions of the TVA that respond principally - but not exclusively - to phylogenetically and acoustically close nonhuman primate vocalizations, namely those of chimpanzees.",

      "title": "Population coupling of V1 and V4 neurons and its relation to local cortical state fluctuations and attention in macaque monkey",
      "content": "Neurons couple to various degrees to the activity level of the local neighboring population whereby strongly coupled 'choristers' and weakly coupled 'soloists' have been identified as two extremes of a continuous spectrum. At the same time neuronal populations undergo coordinated On and Off cortical state activity fluctuations, which are locally modulated by attention. The population coupling of soloists and choristers suggests that soloists should show limited alignment with cortical state fluctuations, while choristers should exhibit profound alignment. To test this, we recorded neurons across cortical layers in macaque areas V1 and V4, while animals performed a feature based spatial attention task. As expected, we found a wide range of population coupling strength of neurons. In line with our prediction, coupling of choristers to cortical state changes (ON-OFF transitions) was generally stronger than that of soloists. The strength of population coupling of neurons was similar during spontaneous and stimulus driven activity. Allocation of attention to the receptive field reduced the population coupling strength. Attentional modulation of neurons was positively correlated with population coupling strength. While neurons on averaged retained their coupling strengths across conditions, some neurons can change coupling strength condition dependent, thereby potentially enhancing the coding abilities of cortical circuits.",

      "title": "Verbal Episodic Processing in Newborns",
      "content": "During the first period of life, human infants rapidly and effortlessly acquire the languages they are exposed to. Although memory is central to this process, the nature of early verbal memory systems and the factors that determine retention and forgetting remain largely unknown. Behavioural and brain measures have demonstrated memory formation in newborns. However, word traces fade in the face of acoustic overlap, leading to interference and forgetting. Here, we investigate whether speakers' identity changes facilitate the separation into distinct acoustic episodes and the creation of non-overlapping verbal memories. Newborns (0-4 days-old) were tested in a familiarization-interference-test protocol, while neural cortical activity was recorded using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results showed higher neural activation for novel words compared to familiar ones in the test phase, indicating that the infants recognized the familiar words despite the presence of potentially interfering sounds. The recognition response was measured over the left inferior frontal (IFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) areas, known to be crucial for encoding auditory information and language processing. The neural response also involved the right IFG and STG, involved in interpreting vocal social cues and speaker recognition. These data show that speaker identity is a key feature of speech, enabling episodic-like memories from birth and evolutionary advantages at the outset of human communication.",

      "content": "Background: Schizotypy (ST) reflects subclinical traits linked to schizophrenia spectrum disorders and associated cognitive and social impairments. Theory of Mind (ToM) and discourse production deficits are well documented in schizophrenia (SZ), yet the neural basis of discourse-related ToM processes in ST remains unclear. This study investigated brain activation during narrative planning and production in individuals with schizotypal traits. Methods: Thirty young adults (mean age = 18.8 years) completed standardized assessments, including the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire Brief Revised (SPQBR), adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), depression (PHQ9), and dissociation (DESB). Participants performed a discourse task in an fMRI scanner, describing nine-panel cartoons requiring inference of character intentions. Behavioral discourse metrics included total and inferred events. fMRI analyses examined activation during planning and production phases, with SPQBR positive, negative, and disorganized traits entered as regressors. Results: Schizotypal traits correlated with multiple psychosocial risk factors, including elevated depression, ACEs, and dissociation (r = .48 .82, p < .01). During planning, canonical ToM/self-referential regions (vmPFC, precuneus, insula) were recruited. Positive traits correlated with increased activation in the right temporo-parietal junction, precuneus, and lingual gyrus, whereas disorganized traits were associated with reduced activation in the precuneus and lingual gyri. During production, networks spanning vmPFC, hippocampus, right TPJ, and basal ganglia were engaged. Negative traits correlated with increased motor/premotor activation, while disorganized traits correlated with reduced activation in lingual gyrus, SMA, and cerebellum. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate distinct neural correlates of schizotypal traits during discourse planning and production, supporting models of schizophrenia spectrum risk emphasizing disrupted inference and integration processes.",

      "content": "The hippocampus is the brain's central locus for memory processing. In a widely accepted hypothesis, the hippocampus stores short-term memories in attractor states, which are then consolidated in the neocortex as long-term memories. Hippocampal replay activities play a pivotal role in memory consolidation, but memories are only transiently, not persistently, replayed, casting doubt on the attractor memory hypothesis. Concepts like memory capacity, the upper bound on the number of storable stable memories in a neural network, may also need to be revised if their offline transient activation is more essential for memory consolidation. Here, we explore the biologically plausible mechanism of offline memory processing by asking a recurrent spiking network to replay reliably as many stored assemblies as possible. We demonstrate the importance of memory-assembly-specific inhibitory plasticity for replaying diverse memory assemblies. Furthermore, our results highlight the role of transient memory states in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.",

      "title": "Cortical tension as a mechanical barrier to safeguard against premature differentiation during neurogenesis",
      "content": "Neuronal differentiation requires coordinated gene reprogramming and morphodynamic remodeling. How mechanical forces integrate with nuclear gene programs during neurogenesis remains unresolved. Here, we identify cortical tension as a mechanical barrier that safeguards against premature neuronal differentiation. Deletion of Plexin-B2, a guidance receptor controlling actomyosin contractility, lowers this barrier, enabling neurite outgrowth and accelerating neuronal lineage commitment. We show that coupling of extrinsic differentiation cues with intrinsic morphodynamics is essential for stabilizing neuronal fate and that cortical barrier and epigenetic barrier act in concert to regulate developmental timing. In cerebral organoids, Plexin-B2 ablation triggered premature cell-cycle exit and differentiation, resulting in progenitor pool depletion and neuroepithelial disorganization, phenotypes echoing intellectual disability in patients with rare pathogenic PLXNB2 variants. Our studies demonstrate that cortical tension functions as mechano-checkpoint that regulates the onset of neurogenesis. Lowering this barrier may provide a strategy to accelerate induced neuron generation and maturation for CNS disease modeling.",

      "title": "Network dynamics underlying activity-timescale differences between cortical regions",
      "content": "Network-level dynamics are thought to be central to computation in the cerebral cortex. Yet, how these dynamics differ across areas remains poorly understood. We leveraged an intrinsic property of cortical regions to tackle this problem - the timescales over which they spontaneously sustain activity. We first co-registered functional and spatial transcriptomics datasets to show that timescales across the mouse cortex are predicted by many transcript categories, including those that regulate circuit wiring. Next, we used simultaneous two-photon imaging and optogenetics in mice to ask how these putative differences in connectivity lead to distinct network responses to brief, focal excitatory input to a short-timescale visual area, VISp, and a long-timescale frontal area, MOs. MOs neurons were more likely to respond to photostimulation of their neighbors. Moreover, the evoked dynamics of the overall network were much longer lasting in MOs than VISp, due to the more prevalent recruitment of late-responding neurons, which formed reliable activity sequences. Overall, our findings show that, beyond single-neuron timescales, different cortical areas are distinctly wired to sustain input over varying time windows via network dynamics, with important implications for our understanding of cortical computation.",
