      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.00289v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: By situating computer-generated content in the physical world, mobile augmented reality (AR) can support many tasks that involve effective search and inspection of physical environments. Currently, there is limited information regarding the viability of using AR in realistic wide-area outdoor environments and how AR experiences affect human behavior in these environments. Here, we conducted a wide-area outdoor AR user study (n = 48) using a commercially available AR headset (Microsoft Hololens 2) to compare (1) user interactions with physical and virtual objects in the environment (2) the effects of different lighting conditions on user behavior and AR experience and (3) the impact of varying cognitive load on AR task performance. Participants engaged in a treasure hunt task where they searched for and classified virtual target items (green ``gems\") in an augmented outdoor courtyard scene populated with physical and virtual objects. Cognitive load was manipulated so that in half the search trials users were required to monitor an audio stream and respond to specific target sounds. Walking paths, head orientation and eye gaze information were measured, and users were queried about their memory of encountered objects and provided feedback on the experience. Key findings included (1) Participants self-reported significantly lower comfort in the ambient natural light condition, with virtual objects more visible and participants more likely to walk into physical objects at night; (2) recall for physical objects was worse than for virtual objects, (3) participants discovered more gems hidden behind virtual objects than physical objects, implying higher attention on virtual objects and (4) dual-tasking modified search behavior. These results suggest there are important technical, perceptual and cognitive factors that must be considered.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.00273v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Gig workers face several vulnerabilities, which are rarely discussed among peers due to the absence of infrastructure for mutual support. To understand how individual gig workers perceive such vulnerabilities and why they continue to pursue such labor, we conducted a scalable two-phase study to probe their rationales. In Phase I, participants (N = 236) rated their agreement with five commonly misconstrued vulnerabilities. In Phase II, we challenged participants who held one or more myth(s) (N = 204) to defend their views, after which we presented an expert- or LLM-generated counterargument to their rationale. Our findings show how workers are underexposed to the personal and shared vulnerabilities of gig work, revealing a knowledge gap where persuasive interventions may help workers recognize such hidden conditions. We discuss the implications of our results to support collective bargaining of workers' rights and reflect on the effectiveness of different persuasion strategies.",

      "title": "Neural Transparency: Mechanistic Interpretability Interfaces for Anticipating Model Behaviors for Personalized AI",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.00230v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Millions of users now design personalized LLM-based chatbots that shape their daily interactions, yet they can only loosely anticipate how their design choices will manifest as behaviors in deployment. This opacity is consequential: seemingly innocuous prompts can trigger excessive sycophancy, toxicity, or inconsistency, degrading utility and raising safety concerns. To address this issue, we introduce an interface that enables neural transparency by exposing language model internals during chatbot design. Our approach extracts behavioral trait vectors (empathy, toxicity, sycophancy, etc.) by computing differences in neural activations between contrastive system prompts that elicit opposing behaviors. We predict chatbot behaviors by projecting the system prompt's final token activations onto these trait vectors, normalizing for cross-trait comparability, and visualizing results via an interactive sunburst diagram. To evaluate this approach, we conducted an online user study using Prolific to compare our neural transparency interface against a baseline chatbot interface without any form of transparency. Our analyses suggest that users systematically miscalibrated AI behavior: participants misjudged trait activations for eleven of fifteen analyzable traits, motivating the need for transparency tools in everyday human-AI interaction. While our interface did not change design iteration patterns, it significantly increased user trust and was enthusiastically received. Qualitative analysis indicated that users' had nuanced experiences with the visualization that may enrich future work designing neurally transparent interfaces. This work offers a path for how mechanistic interpretability can be operationalized for non-technical users, establishing a foundation for safer, more aligned human-AI interactions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.00207v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: De-identified health data are frequently used in research. As AI advances heighten the risk of re-identification, it is important to respond to concerns about transparency, data privacy, and patient preferences. However, few practical and user-friendly solutions exist. We developed iAGREE, a patient-centered electronic consent management portal that allows patients to set granular preferences for sharing electronic health records and biospecimens with researchers. To refine the iAGREE portal, we conducted a mixed-methods usability evaluation with 40 participants from three U.S. health systems. Our results show that the portal received highly positive usability feedback. Moreover, participants identified areas for improvement, suggested actionable enhancements, and proposed additional features to better support informed granular consent while reducing patient burden. Insights from this study may inform further improvements to iAGREE and provide practical guidance for designing patient-centered consent management tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.00195v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) are important tools for researchers seeking to conduct studies with a broad, global participant base. Despite their popularity and demonstrated utility, we present evidence that suggests the integrity of data collected through Amazon MTurk is being threatened by the presence of puppeteers, apparently human workers controlling multiple puppet accounts that are capable of bypassing standard attention checks. If left undetected, puppeteers and their puppets can undermine the integrity of data collected on these platforms. This paper investigates data from two Amazon MTurk studies, finding that a substantial proportion of accounts (33% to 56.4%) are likely puppets. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting multifaceted strategies to ensure data integrity on crowdsourcing platforms. With the goal of detecting this type of fraud, we discuss a set of potential countermeasures for both puppets and bots with varying degrees of sophistication (e.g., employing AI). The problem of single entities (or puppeteers) manually controlling multiple accounts could exist on other crowdsourcing platforms; as such, their detection may be of broader application.\n  While our findings suggest the need to re-evaluate the quality of crowdsourced data, many previous studies likely remain valid, particularly those with robust experimental designs. However, the presence of puppets may have contributed to false null results in some studies, suggesting that unpublished work may be worth revisiting with effective puppet detection strategies.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.15542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware, considering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses that can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints, enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values (M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.",

      "title": "From Epilepsy Seizures Classification to Detection: A Deep Learning-based Approach for Raw EEG Signals",
      "content": "arXiv:2410.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Epilepsy represents the most prevalent neurological disease in the world. One-third of people suffering from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) exhibit drug resistance, urging the need to develop new treatments. A key part in anti-seizure medication (ASM) development is the capability of detecting and quantifying epileptic seizures occurring in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which is crucial for treatment efficacy evaluation. In this study, we introduced a seizure detection pipeline based on deep learning models applied to raw EEG signals. This pipeline integrates: a new pre-processing technique which segments continuous raw EEG signals without prior distinction between seizure and seizure-free activities; a post-processing algorithm developed to reassemble EEG segments and allow the identification of seizures start/end; and finally, a new evaluation procedure based on a strict seizure events comparison between predicted and real labels. Models training have been performed using a data splitting strategy which addresses the potential for data leakage. We demonstrated the fundamental differences between a seizure classification and a seizure detection task and showed the differences in performance between the two tasks. Finally, we demonstrated the generalization capabilities across species of our best architecture, combining a Convolutional Neural Network and a Transformer encoder. The model was trained on animal EEGs and tested on human EEGs with a F1-score of 93% on a balanced Bonn dataset.",

      "title": "InputDSA: Demixing then Comparing Recurrent and Externally Driven Dynamics",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.25943v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In control problems and basic scientific modeling, it is important to compare observations with dynamical simulations. For example, comparing two neural systems can shed light on the nature of emergent computations in the brain and deep neural networks. Recently, Ostrow et al. (2023) introduced Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA), a method to measure the similarity of two systems based on their recurrent dynamics rather than geometry or topology. However, DSA does not consider how inputs affect the dynamics, meaning that two similar systems, if driven differently, may be classified as different. Because real-world dynamical systems are rarely autonomous, it is important to account for the effects of input drive. To this end, we introduce a novel metric for comparing both intrinsic (recurrent) and input-driven dynamics, called InputDSA (iDSA). InputDSA extends the DSA framework by estimating and comparing both input and intrinsic dynamic operators using a variant of Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) based on subspace identification. We demonstrate that InputDSA can successfully compare partially observed, input-driven systems from noisy data. We show that when the true inputs are unknown, surrogate inputs can be substituted without a major deterioration in similarity estimates. We apply InputDSA on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning, identifying that high-performing networks are dynamically similar to one another, while low-performing networks are more diverse. Lastly, we apply InputDSA to neural data recorded from rats performing a cognitive task, demonstrating that it identifies a transition from input-driven evidence accumulation to intrinsically-driven decision-making. Our work demonstrates that InputDSA is a robust and efficient method for comparing intrinsic dynamics and the effect of external input on dynamical systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2407.04525v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has been driven by insights from physics and neuroscience, particularly through the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of complex cognitive tasks such as vision and language processing. Despite these advances, they struggle with continual learning, adaptable knowledge transfer, robustness, and resource efficiency -- capabilities that biological systems handle seamlessly. Specifically, neuromorphic systems and artificial neural networks often overlook two key biophysical properties of neural circuits: neuronal diversity and cell-specific neuromodulation. These mechanisms, essential for regulating dynamic learning across brain scales, allow neuromodulators to introduce degeneracy in biological neural networks, ensuring stability and adaptability under changing conditions. In this article, we summarize recent bioinspired models, learning rules, and architectures, and propose a framework for augmenting ANNs, which has the potential to bridge the gap between neuroscience and AI through neurobiological first principles. Our proposed dual-framework approach leverages spiking neural networks to emulate diverse spiking behaviors and dendritic compartmental dynamics, thereby simulating the morphological and functional diversity of neuronal computations. Finally, we outline how integrating these biophysical principles into task-driven spiking neural networks and neuromorphic systems provides scalable solutions for continual learning, adaptability, robustness, and resource-efficiency. Additionally, this approach will not only provide insights into how emergent behaviors arise in neural networks but also catalyze the development of more efficient, reliable, and intelligent neuromorphic systems and robotic agents.",

To quantify the behavioral effects of such interventions in a freely moving mouse, we developed a dual-channel magnetic chamber, specifically designed for rate-sensitive magnetothermal-genetic stimulation, and adaptable for other uses of alternating magnetic fields. Through an optimized coil design, the system allows independent control of two spatially orthogonal uniform magnetic fields delivered at different frequencies within a 10 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm chamber. The two channels have nominal frequencies of 50 and 550 kHz with peak magnetic field strengths of 88 and 12.5 mT, achieved with resonant coil drives having peak voltages of 1.6 and 1.8 kV and currents of 1.0 and 0.26 kA, respectively. Additionally, a liquid cooling system enables magnetic field generation for second-level duration, and an observation port and camera allow video capture of the animal's behavior within the chamber. The system generates high-amplitude magnetic fields across two widely separated frequency channels with negligible interference (< 1%). Relatively uniform magnetic field distribution (+/-10% across 94% of the chamber volume) is maintained throughout the chamber, and temperature increase of the inner side of the coil enclosure during the operation is limited to < 0.35 {\\deg}C/s to ensure in vivo safety. Using cobalt-doped and undoped iron oxide nanoparticles, we demonstrate channel-specific heating rates of 3.5 {\\deg}C/s and 1.5 {\\deg}C/s, respectively, validating frequency-selectivity. Both channels can run continuously for four seconds stably.",

      "title": "Variational Representational Similarity Analysis (vRSA) for M/EEG",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.01784v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper introduces variational representational similarity analysis RSA (vRSA) for electromagnetic recordings of neural responses (e.g., EEG, MEG, ECoG or LFP). Variational RSA is a Bayesian approach for testing whether the similarity of stimuli or experimental conditions is expressed in univariate or multivariate neural recordings. Extending an approach previously introduced in the context of functional MRI, vRSA decomposes the condition-by-condition data covariance matrix into hypothesised effects and observation noise, thereby casting RSA as a covariance component estimation problem. In this context, peristimulus time may be treated as an experimental factor, enabling one to test for the probability that different experimental effects are expressed in data at different times. Variational Bayesian methods are used for model estimation and model comparison, which confer a number of advantages over classical approaches, including statistically efficient hypothesis testing, quantification of uncertainty using Bayesian credible intervals and computational efficiency. After introducing the theory, we provide a worked example using openly available EEG data. Software functions implementing vRSA for the SPM software package accompany this paper, together with exemplar analysis scripts.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.00013v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study introduces a novel method for predicting cognitive age using psychophysiological tests. To determine cognitive age, subjects were asked to complete a series of psychological tests measuring various cognitive functions, including reaction time and cognitive conflict, short-term memory, verbal functions, and color and spatial perception. Based on the tests completed, the average completion time, proportion of correct answers, average absolute delta of the color campimetry test, number of guessed words in the M\\\"unsterberg matrix, and other parameters were calculated for each subject. The obtained characteristics of the subjects were preprocessed and used to train a machine learning algorithm implementing a regression task for predicting a person's cognitive age. These findings contribute to the field of remote screening using mobile devices for human health for diagnosing and monitoring cognitive aging.",
