      "title": "Histological analysis of thrombus composition in acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion: impact of r-tPA treatment",
      "content": "Background and purposeMechanical thrombectomy advances enable detection of thrombus composition changes post-intravenous thrombolysis, but evidence remains limited. This study retrospectively analyzed thrombi obtained from mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke to explore the impact of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) on the composition of thrombi in patients with different TOAST classifications and the association between changes in thrombus components and clinical outcome data.Materials and methodsThrombus samples from 141 patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy (n\u202f=\u202f60) or bridging therapy (n\u202f=\u202f81) at two hospitals between December 2020 and January 2024 were included. Baseline data and outcome data were collected. Components were analyzed via HE staining and immunohistochemistry for CD61 and FGB, quantifying area percentages of red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), platelet-fibrin complexes (PLT\u202f+\u202fFIB), platelet (PLT), and fibrin (FIB). Thrombus components were compared between the mechanical thrombectomy and bridging therapy groups according to TOAST subtypes, and a combined analysis was conducted with clinical prognosis and surgical conditions.ResultsNo significant baseline differences (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Significant component differences between mechanical thrombectomy and bridging therapy across subtypes: in large artery atherosclerotic (LAA), FIB higher in mechanical thrombectomy (p\u202f=\u202f0.001); in cardioembolic (CE), PLT and FIB higher in mechanical thrombectomy (p\u202f=\u202f0.003, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Subtype comparisons showed differences: LAA vs. CE in RBC, PLT\u202f+\u202fFIB, PLT, FIB (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); LAA vs. stroke of undetermined source (SUE) in PLT and FIB (p\u202f<\u202f0.05); CE vs. SUE in FIB (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionThis study quantified the thrombus components of different etiologies and found that IVT could reduce the FIB content in thrombi of large artery occlusion cerebral infarction, especially in the LAA type. The platelet content in the LAA type was higher than that in the CE and the SUE types. The FIB level in the SUE type was higher than that in the CE type. FIB was not only present in the PLT area but also in the RBC area. IVT may improve thrombectomy success by disrupting thrombus structure, but it can increase fragment embolization and prolong procedure time.",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",
