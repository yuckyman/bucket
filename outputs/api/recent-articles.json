These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others.

      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

      "title": "Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for In Vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Data",
      "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

      "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

      "title": "Odor-induced Sustained Neural Activity during Memory Encoding",
      "content": "How long do the neural and cognitive effects of a brief odor experience last? This study investigated whether short exposures to pleasant and unpleasant odors can induce sustained changes in brain activity and influence memory formation for events occurring several seconds later. Using EEG, we combined univariate ERP analyses with time-resolved multivariate decoding to track neural responses during a 6-sec delay between odor presentation and visual memory encoding. We found that brief odor cues elicited sustained neural activity that persisted well beyond odor offset. Unpleasant odors, in particular, were associated with higher sustained ERP amplitudes compared with pleasant ones. Behaviorally, participants showed greater confidence in recognizing images that had been preceded by unpleasant odors, suggesting that even brief olfactory experiences can modulate memory encoding for temporally distant events. These findings demonstrate that brief olfactory cues have a lasting effect on both neural activity and subsequent memory performance.",
