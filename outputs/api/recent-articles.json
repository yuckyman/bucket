      "title": "Brain serotonin circuit reverses decline in physical activity with age",
      "content": "Physical inactivity increases with age and is the fourth leading risk factor for mortality. Establishing the mechanisms underpinning declining physical activity (PA) with age has remained both elusive and difficult to overcome. Older (50-70 years old) compared with younger (17-30 years old) UK participants showed reduced PA, and this profile was effectively modelled in mice. Analysis of brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe (DR) revealed altered firing activity in older mice. Chemogenetically mimicking this 5-HTDR tone in young adult mice produced an older adult PA profile. Genetically blocking 5-HT activity at 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) prevented the decline in PA with age. Importantly, barring 5-HT action at 5-HT2CRs specifically within the ventral tegmental area restored youthful PA levels and strength in older mice. These data fill a longstanding knowledge gap by defining brain circuitry programming the decline in PA with age, and importantly, a means to reverse it.",

      "content": "Elaborated temporal structures in behavior have been recognized as a hallmark of high-level cognitive processes, such as planning or natural language. Systems neuroscience experiments in behaving animals have validated cell-assemblies as a fundamental piece of neural circuitry underlying lower-level cognitive processes. Although recent research has identified neural bases for certain temporally structured behaviors, it is still an open question whether a general-purpose circuit - akin to cell assemblies - supports such behaviors. Here we introduce Neural Latching Switch Circuits and show how they can be assembled as lego-bricks to create neural architectures suited for the implementation of any procedural behavior. By focusing on increasingly complex temporal structures and leveraging a combination of theoretical tools, we demonstrate how these circuits can be mapped onto the fly's head-direction system and propose quantitative testable predictions for identifying analogous structures in mammalian brains, for instance in cortical columns. By interpreting neural architectures as computing automata we reveal surprising relationships between behavior and computation.",

      "title": "Episodic experience drives ripple reorganization and synaptic changes in the hippocampus",
      "content": "The hippocampus plays a key role in encoding episodic memory by transforming recent experience into persistent neuronal and synaptic modifications. However, the physiological processes that link real-world experience to network-level and cellular-level changes remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated how distinct types of episodic experience reorganize ensemble firing dynamics and synaptic input in the hippocampal CA1 region of freely moving rats. We identified spontaneous \"super bursts\"- brief episodes of high-frequency firing across neuronal populations - that emerged specifically during emotionally salient experiences. These bursts were followed by increased ripple firings, characterized as short, synchronous events associated with memory consolidation. Using information entropy analysis, we found that ripple firing patterns became more diverse after experience, indicating enhanced variability in neural representation. Ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed that miniature excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons also underwent experience-specific reorganization. Together, these findings propose a cascading mechanism in which episodic experience triggers coordinated ensemble activity, leading to ripple reorganization and synaptic remodeling, thereby contributing to the initial encoding of memory. Our study integrates systems-level neuronal dynamics with cellular-level synaptic plasticity, offering new physiological insights into how brain circuits adapt to experience.",

The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "A TRANSPARENT WHEEL-BASED PLATFORM FOR LOCOMOTION-ON-DEMAND AND MULTIMODAL BODY AND FACIAL KINEMATICS IN HEAD-FIXED MICE",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain transforms sensory input and internal state into coordinated action requires behavioral paradigms that provide precise, multimodal measurements of movement and arousal while remaining compatible with neural recording techniques. Here we present a modular, low-cost behavioral platform that enables locomotion-on-demand in head-fixed mice using a transparent running wheel combined with air-stream-induced stimulation. This design provides unobstructed visual access to ventral paw movements while simultaneously capturing whole-body kinematics, facial motion, and eye-related signals from multiple camera perspectives. The system integrates Arduino-based stimulus control, high-resolution encoder measurements, Raspberry Pi-based videography, and LED-driven temporal synchronization across independently acquired data streams. Using a proof-of-principle dataset from a single, well-trained animal, we demonstrate that air delivery reliably induces structured locomotion with reproducible trial timing on a transparent wheel. Optical-flow-based motion metrics and DeepLabCut pose estimation reveal robust, stimulus-locked increases in paw, limb, and facial movements during air-on epochs relative to air-off periods. LED-based synchronization enables accurate segmentation of stimulus epochs across video modalities despite differences in sampling rates, with air-on durations showing strong agreement between video-derived and DAQ-recorded measures. Correlation analyses further reveal state-dependent reorganization of coordinated body kinematics during locomotion, indicating structured coupling among limb and whole-body measures rather than a uniform increase in movement. This work establishes a flexible framework for studying stimulus-evoked locomotion and provides a platform well suited for integration with neural imaging and electrophysiology, as well as for future investigations of sensorimotor coordination and behavioral state changes in health and disease.",

      "content": "Microglia are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis, including the sleep-wake cycle, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging in both head-fixed and freely moving mice with simultaneous electroencephalogram-electromyogram (EEG-EMG) recording, we investigated microglial process dynamics and their interactions with locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic (NE) axons in the frontal cortex across sleep-wake states. During sleep or chemogenetic suppression of LC neurons, microglia enhanced their surveillance and increased interactions with NE axons. Correlative electron microscopy at nanometer resolution identified structural contacts between microglial process endings and NE boutons. Mechanistically, microglia-bouton interaction is primed by NE-{beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) signaling, leading to enhanced Ca2+activity in NE axons. These findings suggest that microglial interactions with NE axons promote cortical norepinephrine transmission and maintain stable wakefulness.",

      "content": "Under mesopic conditions, such as dawn or dusk, signals from both rod and cone photoreceptors contribute to perception. These parallel inputs are combined within the retina before being sent to subsequent visual areas. The integration of these kinetically-distinct parallel signals poses unique challenges for human vision. Though previous behavioral studies have found that dim lighting conditions specifically impair motion perception in human subjects, the origin of this dependence is unclear. In the present study, we create a model circuit that predicts ganglion cell responses to moving stimuli by incorporating electrophysiologically-derived circuit components into a Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, a classical motion-detection model. The model circuit demonstrates that interactions between rod- and cone-derived signals negatively impact the encoding of a moving object's direction under mesopic conditions. Furthermore, we found that the model circuit could enhance its motion discriminability if it was only sensitive to the cone-activating components of the stimuli.

      "title": "Multimodal Data Fusion Reveals Morpho-Genetic Variations in Human Cortical Neurons Associated with Tumor Infiltration",
      "content": "We introduce LetsACT (Light-Electron-Transcriptome synergistic ACTomography), a multimodal integration platform that overcomes the limitations of single-modality data acquisition and analysis of human brain cells while synergistically leveraging the strengths of each modality. Our approach enables the rapid sample preparation, cell injection, imaging, and multimodal integration of large-scale human neuronal datasets at single-cell resolution. By generating initial laser-scanning-microscopy based optical reconstruction of neuron morphologies followed by refining them using electron-microscopy derived morphological priors, we have assembled one of the largest human cortical morphology datasets to date: 8,398 neurons from 58 donors, with high cortical coverage. This platform is then applied to studying morphological impact of tumor infiltration. Pyramidal neurons in glioma-infiltrated tissues display clear volume shrinkage in somas and branches, tapering from the soma to nearby dendritic compartments. By integrating these morphological variations with spatial and bulk transcriptomic profiles, we find that glioblastoma tissues exhibit dysregulation of 15.29% of genes, including overexpression of TERT, whereas infiltrated tissues show 7.74% gene dysregulation, characterized by overexpression of tumor suppressors such as CDKN2A and TP53. Our analysis implies that pyramidal neurons observed in these infiltrated tissues may involve an active defense instead of undergoing passive apoptosis. Our finding also indicates that LetsACT establishes a valuable resource for the large-scale, comprehensive morpho-genetic analysis of human tissues.",
