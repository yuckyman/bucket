      "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
      "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "content": "Objective. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture, the convolutional spider neural network (CS-Net), combined with a transfer learning (TL) strategy, to classify hybrid gestures that integrate wrist postures and hand movements. Approach. The CS-Net framework incorporates diverse surface electromyography (sEMG) features, including raw signals and FFT representations, through a multi-stream information fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance. The proposed TL strategy involves pre-training the model on specific wrist postures and fine-tuning it on the full set of hybrid gestures, leveraging the intrinsic relationships between composite gestures and their constituent movements to improve accuracy. The framework is evaluated through extensive offline experiments using a dataset of 12 hybrid gestures (combining three wrist postures and four hand movements) collected from six subjects, comparing its performance against three deep learning algorithms in sEMG recognition filed. Main results. The average experimental result for the proposed CS-Net with TL reached 90.6%. Additionally, its generalization ability is validated with the Ninapro public databases, which are DB1, DB4, and DB5. The 30 action classification accuracy of CS-Net on the Ninapro datasets was 68.7%, 61.5% and 66.3%, respectively. To demonstrate practical applicability, real-time online experiments involving object grasping tasks is conducted, achieving a success rate of 90%. Significance. The results show that CS-Net significantly improves sEMG classification accuracy, while the TL strategy further enhances performance. Moreover, the algorithm achieved a high success rate in online experiments, confirming its robustness and practical utility for real-world applications. Our hybrid gesture dataset and source codes are available on Github.",

      "content": "Opioid misuse remains rampant as new synthetic opioids reach the market. Large-scale genetic tools like the GWAS identify previously unrecognized targets and biomarkers in opioid misuse with hopes of combating the opioid epidemic. One such target is the AMPAR auxiliary protein Cornichon Homolog-3 (human analog: CNIH3, mouse analog: Cnih3), which determines AMPAR subunit composition and kinetics. Though CNIH3 was identified as a gene of interest in OUD, its role in opioid use and accompanying risk factors has not been studied. Using mice with Cnih3 deletion, we assess the role of CNIH3 in risk factors for opioid use, cognition, and opioid use itself. We find that Cnih3 deletion moderately impairs spatial memory, reward-cue association, and reversal learning. Cnih3 deletion also impairs fentanyl-cue association and blunts fentanyl intake during IVSA. We use principal component analysis to pinpoint the dimensions in which Cnih3 deletion impacts behavior in an unbiased manner. Additionally, we identify in previously published human data that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are more protective against progression to daily opioid use in women than in men, suggesting a potential sex-specific role of CNIH3. These findings highlight an important role of CNIH3 in opioid use through learning and memory processes that may differ between males and females.",

      "content": "Decision-making is an essential cognitive function. It can be impaired due to a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders as well as external factors such as time pressure or stress. To assist users during decision-making, we propose a decision-making brain computer interface (BCI) that can alert to uninformed decision-making, prompt additional information seeking and therefore improve decision-making quality. To this aim, we establish the feasibility of decoding uninformed decision-making from local field potentials recorded with implanted stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes in 6 participants. We show that decoding of available information above chance level is possible for all participants, both after stimulus presentation, as well as before task response. Starting from stimulus onset, the temporal processing hierarchy of informed vs. uninformed decision-making spans from visual processing through hippocampal memory processes to frontal control network shifting. The anterior insula, known to be a decision-making hub, codes available information during the decision phase prior to button press. These results further elucidate the neural basis of coded information availability and confirm the feasibility of a decision-making BCI.",

      "title": "Multiparametric MRI and imaging transcriptomics reveal molecular and cellular correlates of neurodegeneration in experimental multiple system atrophy",
      "content": "Background: Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive -synucleinopathy characterized by parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction associated with widespread oligodendroglial -synuclein inclusions, gliosis, and neurodegeneration. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed characteristic patterns of brain atrophy and microstructural alterations in MSA, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these imaging abnormalities remain poorly understood. The proteolipid protein-human -synuclein (PLP-Syn) transgenic mouse model reproduces key pathological and behavioral features of MSA and provides a valuable platform to dissect the biological substrates of MRI-detected changes and their relevance to disease mechanisms. Methods: We performed the first whole-brain MRI characterization of the PLP-Syn model using ex vivo structural and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with imaging alterations, we applied an imaging transcriptomics framework integrating MRI-derived phenotypes with more than 4,000 spatial gene expression maps from the Allen Brain Atlas. Gene ontology and cell-type enrichment analyses identified biological processes and cellular contributors linked to MRI changes, and imaging-correlated genes were compared with differentially expressed genes from cerebellar RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to assess molecular concordance. Results: PLP-Syn mice exhibited widespread brain atrophy involving the brainstem, cerebellum, thalamus, and white matter tracts, closely mirroring neuroimaging findings in patients with MSA. DTI revealed decreased fractional anisotropy in major white matter tracts and increased mean diffusivity in the brainstem and cerebellum, reflecting distinct microstructural pathologies. Imaging transcriptomics linked these alterations to genes regulating myelination, gliogenesis, and neuroinflammation, strongly enriched for oligodendrocyte and astrocyte markers, while diffusivity changes were associated with neuronal connectivity and energy metabolism. Imaging-correlated gene signatures showed significant overlap with RNAseq-derived molecular profiles, reinforcing the biological validity of the imaging-derived mechanisms. Conclusions: MRI sensitively detects MSA-like neurodegeneration in the PLP-Syn mouse, providing a translationally relevant platform to investigate the biological basis of imaging biomarkers. Integrating MRI with spatial transcriptomics reveals distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying MRI-detected alterations, advancing mechanistic understanding of MRI changes in MSA and establishing imaging transcriptomics as a powerful approach to bridge neuroimaging with molecular pathology in -synucleinopathies.",
