      "title": "Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) for spastic cerebral palsy",
      "content": "BackgroundGait abnormalities in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) result from four primary neuromuscular impairments: muscle weakness, short muscle-relative-to-skeletal-length, muscle spasticity, and impaired selective motor control. The Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) was developed to help clinicians identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP for use in any clinical setting.AimsThis study evaluated use and validity of the observational-based Clinical GENI to identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in children with spastic CP.MethodsPatients with spastic CP seen in 2023 for instrumented gait analysis and physical exam of neuromuscular impairments were evaluated using the Clinical GENI. Validity was assessed by agreement between identification of gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI compared to 3D gait kinematics. Severity of neuromuscular impairments associated with gait abnormalities listed on the Clinical GENI was compared, and severity of neuromuscular impairment was correlated with severity of gait abnormalities.ResultsParticipants included 12 children with spastic CP (4 GMFCS I, 8 GMFCS II; mean age 11.25 years). The most common gait abnormalities were forefoot/flatfoot initial contact (IC) (16/24), flexed-knee IC (19/24), hip-flexion in single limb stance (12/24), and reduced pre-swing ankle plantarflexion (19/24). Strong agreement (83\u2013100%) occurred between gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI and kinematic values. Severity of neuromuscular impairment was higher (p < 0.05) for those with gait abnormalities vs. without and correlated to severity of gait abnormalities in a majority of comparisons.ConclusionResults support clinical utility and validity of the Clinical GENI for evaluating gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP.",

      "title": "A pilot study on simultaneous stimulation of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area using gait-synchronized rhythmic brain stimulation to improve gait variability in post-stroke hemiparetic patients",
      "content": "IntroductionGait impairment is a common and disabling consequence of stroke. While walking speed is a key indicator of recovery, gait variability is closely associated with fall risk and long-term functional decline. Previous studies have suggested that functional interaction between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) plays a key role in post-stroke gait control. Rather than stimulating these regions independently, simultaneous activation of the SMA\u2014critical for rhythm modulation and motor planning\u2014and gait-synchronized stimulation of the M1\u2014essential for motor execution\u2014may offer enhanced benefits for gait stability.ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of a combined brain stimulation intervention targeting the SMA and M1 on gait variability and balance in individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis.MethodsSixteen individuals with stroke within 180 days after the onset, aged 40\u201390 years, who were able to walk on a treadmill were recruited in this study of multi-center, randomized, controlled pilot trial with a parallel-group design. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n = 8) receiving 20 min of simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the SMA and gait-synchronized rhythmic stimulation to the M1 during treadmill walking, or to a control group (n = 8) receiving sham stimulation. Both groups underwent 15 sessions of walking practice over 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were feasibility indicators including recruitment, retention, adherence and adverse events and preliminary estimates of effect on gait variability such as coefficient of variation for stride, stance, and swing times on the paretic side. Balance was assessed using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest).ResultsAll 16 participants completed the intervention without adverse events, indicating high feasibility. The intervention group showed significantly reduced stride time variability on the paretic side and improved Mini-BESTest scores compared to the control group. A significant correlation was observed between reductions in gait variability and improvements in balance.ConclusionsThis pilot trial supports the feasibility and safety of a combined SMA and M1 stimulation approach. Preliminary findings suggest potential benefits in reducing gait variability and improving balance after stroke, warranting further investigation in a definitive trial.",

      "title": "Brain structure correlates of foreign language learning experiences",
      "content": "Previous research demonstrates that bilingual experiences produce dynamic and variable structural adaptations in the brain. However, most studies focus on individuals who naturally acquire multiple languages, leaving the neural effects of long-term foreign language learners with limited exposure less understood. In this study, we examined 32 young adult long-term foreign language learners in South Korea to determine how age of acquisition, proficiency, and daily use shape gray matter volume and white matter integrity in predominantly monolingual environments. We found structural changes in brain regions involved in language control and executive function. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that earlier foreign language acquisition was significantly associated with greater gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal lobule (uncorrected p < 0.001) and the left thalamus (uncorrected p < 0.001). Higher daily use was significantly associated with greater volume in the right inferior parietal lobule (uncorrected p = 0.001) but reduced it in the right anterior cingulate cortex (uncorrected p < 0.001). Tract-based spatial statistics analysis further showed that earlier age of acquisition was significantly associated with better white matter integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum (FWE-corrected p = 0.009), while higher daily use was significantly associated with better integrity in the body of the corpus callosum (FWE-corrected p = 0.030). These findings suggest that even limited but sustained exposure to a foreign language can lead to significant structural adaptations, broadening our understanding of language-related neuroplasticity beyond traditional bilingual contexts.",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Pain-related TMDs patients had weaker orofacial tactile acuity, which was consistent in gender subgroups, except for the temporal region of males. Healthy males had weaker tactile acuity compared to females in TMJ and temporal regions. No significant gender effect on orofacial tactile acuity was observed among male and female patients. The 2-PDTs of the tested sites, especially for TMJ, has the potential for further utilization in pain-related TMDs patients.",

The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",
