      "content": "IntroductionCognitive impairment is a prevalent nonmotor symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), significantly affecting patients\u2019 quality of life. Considering the gap in understanding the relationship between cognitive impairments in Parkinson\u2019s disease and executive function, this study aimed to investigate the association between three cognitive statutes: normal cognition condition (PD-NCC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and mild dementia (PDD), and the performance of the Anterior Attentional System in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 96 participants with Parkinson\u2019s disease (45 with PD-NCC, 39 with PD-MCI, and 12 with PDD) and 46 participants from control group, recruited between 2020 and 2023. MDS-UPDRS was used during the neurological examination. To assess cognitive status, we used: Mini-Mental State Examination, Californian Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (A and B form). The ROtman Baycrest Battery was employed to evaluate the Anterior Attentional System.ResultsParticipants with PDD exhibited significant impairments in the Anterior Attentional System. Energization impairment was observed in PD-MCI and PDD, though mildly. Monitoring and task-setting processes were notably impaired only in individuals with PDD, while these functions remained intact in those with PD-NCC and PD-MCI.ConclusionThe Anterior Attentional System is well-preserved in PD-NCC and PD-MCI however notably disturbed in PDD.",

      "content": "IntroductionStandardized treadmill-based balance disturbances have potential to improve assessments of dynamic balance control in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here we examined the validity of a step threshold task to measure dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThirty-nine participants with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease underwent clinical testing and performed a dynamic balance assessment both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. For the assessment, participants were instructed to avoid stepping in response to progressively larger postural perturbations applied via treadmill translations. The step threshold was defined as the perturbation magnitude that resulted in a stepping response on four consecutive trials. Validity was assessed by correlating medication-mediated changes in gold standard clinical measures and medication-mediated changes in stepping.ResultsMedication-mediated changes in step threshold correlated with changes in MDS-UPDRS part III (p < 0.01), with change in MDS-UPDRS 3.12 postural instability (p < 0.05), and with measures of executive function: CPT-3 Omission T-score (p = 0.013), the CPT-3 Commission T-score (p = 0.019), and the CPT-3 Variability T-score (p = 0.040).DiscussionOur results validate step threshold task as a measure of dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Correlations with gold standard assessments of motor and executive function suggest that the step threshold task can serve as a comprehensive measure of dynamic balance control.",

      "title": "The effects of aquatic and land-based interventions on children with developmental coordination disorder",
      "content": "BackgroundKnowledge about the effects of aquatic intervention on children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), as well as the maintenance of these effects over time, is still scarce. We believe that there is a need to advance our knowledge of this subject, for which we have set ourselves the following objectives: (1) to test whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions influence the motor performance of children with DCD; (2) to check whether these effects persist over time; and (3) whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions bring motor performance values closer together between children with DCD and those with typical development.Methods76 children aged between 6 and 10 years old were divided into four groups, control developmental coordination disorder (C-DCD); control typical development (C-TD); experimental terrestrial developmental coordination disorder (T-DCD); and experimental aquatic developmental coordination disorder (A-DCD). Due to some dropouts, the final sample consisted of 66 children, 27 girls and 39 boys. The groups of children with DCD were randomized according to their initial total score on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Test - second edition (MABC-2). The analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) carried out in the pre-test showed similarity between the means of the DCD groups (C-DCD, T-DCD and A-DCD), which ensured that these groups started from the same performance level. The interventions lasted 4.5 months (18 weeks) with three sessions a week, totaling 54 sessions of 60 min each. The experimental groups took part in the same intervention protocol, with the only difference being the environment (A-DCD = aquatic environment; T-DCD = terrestrial environment).ResultsAnalysis of the results revealed no significant effect for the group and time point interaction, F(6, 133) = 1.36, p = 0.235. However, effects were detected for group, F(2, 54.7) = 3.78, p < 0.05, and for time point F(3, 131) = 22.91, p < 0.001. The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test found a difference between the T-DCD and C-DCD groups (p < 0.05; independent-groups effect size (dig = 0.85; dig = 0.87; dig = 0.92). For time point, differences were found between the pre-test and the other time points [post-intervention (repeated measures effect size) (dR,M = 1.14), 3 months post-test (dR,M = 1.51) and 6 months post-test (dR,M = 2.2)] with a significance level of p < 0.001. For the A-DCD group there was no statistically significant difference in relation to either the C-DCD or T-DCD group, but we did observe large effect size values [pre-test and post-test (dR,M = 1.14), pre-test and 3 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.29) and pre-test and 6 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.61)]. Regarding the analysis of the Z score, the results indicated an interaction effect for the group and time point F(6, 132) = 2.30, p = 0.038. This difference was located by post hoc between the C-DCD group and the A-DCD (p < 0.05; independent groups pre-test - post-test effect size (digpp = 1.72) and dig = 0.79) and T-DCD (p < 0.05 ES digpp = 1.65 and dig = 0.79) groups at 6 months-post-test.ConclusionWe conclude that both aquatic and terrestrial interventions have positive effects on the motor performance of children with DCD, that these effects are maintained over time but also bring the motor performance of children with DCD closer to that of children with typical development.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "content": "Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) represents a critical prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet effective therapeutic interventions to prevent or delay this conversion remain an unmet clinical need. Growing evidence implicates dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA)-a complex bidirectional communication network involving neural, immune, and endocrine pathways-in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. This perspective proposes that acupuncture, as a multi-target therapeutic approach, may modulate gut microbiota composition and restore MGBA homeostasis, thereby potentially decelerating the progression from aMCI to AD. A systematic understanding of the precise mechanisms through which acupuncture influences the MGBA carries substantial implications for both neuroscience and clinical practice. Future investigations should prioritize the elucidation of these mechanisms and the generation of robust clinical evidence through well-controlled experimental designs.",

      "title": "Comparative efficacy and safety of symptomatic therapy and disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundThe management of Alzheimer\u2019s disease has shifted toward disease-modifying therapies aimed at delaying disease progression rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. This study summarizes the latest evidence regarding the benefits and harms of anti-Alzheimer\u2019s disease drugs.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science databases, and other sources up to April 2025. Two researchers independently reviewed the literature and analyzed the data. A network meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.3 and Stata version 18.0 to calculate mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for direct and indirect comparisons. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA). Bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version 2.0, and publication bias was analyzed with funnel plots.ResultsThe network meta-analysis included 23 randomized controlled trials with 16,010 participants, evaluating nine pharmacological interventions ranging from traditional symptomatic therapies to four United States Food and Drug Administration- and National Medical Products Administration-approved disease-modifying therapies, notably anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies. Aducanumab significantly improved ADAS-cog scores compared with placebo (MD -5.97, 95%CI -10.33, \u22121.61; SUCRA: 93.0%) and demonstrated notable improvements in ADCS-ADL scores (MD 4.99, 95%CI 2.27, 7.72; SUCRA: 98.6%). Memantine ranked highest for neuropsychiatric symptoms (SUCRA: 80.8%). Aducanumab also had the highest SUCRA for CDR-SB (91.5%) and showed moderate superiority in MMSE scores (MD 3.55, 95%CI 1.35, 5.75; SUCRA: 98.2%).ConclusionSymptomatic treatments, especially memantine for neuropsychiatric symptoms, remain effective. However, the network meta-analysis indicates that, for patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease, aducanumab demonstrates the greatest potential for cognitive and clinical improvement (MMSE, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL), despite associated risks such as adverse events and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities linked to disease-modifying therapies. Lecanemab provides moderate benefits, while donanemab appears less effective. Thus, clinicians should apply disease-modifying therapies cautiously and individually, carefully balancing potential risks and benefits for each patient.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO [CRD42025637730], https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/.",

      "title": "Exploring The Interaction-Outcome Paradox: Seemingly Richer and More Self-Aware Interactions with LLMs May Not Yet Lead to Better Learning",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.09458v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the user interface for learning, moving from keyword search to natural language dialogue, their impact on educational outcomes remains unclear. We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs). This insight provides a new lens for evaluating educational technologies, suggesting that the future of learning tools lies not in simply enriching interaction, but in designing systems that scaffold productive cognitive work by leveraging this student expressiveness.",

      "title": "Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.09454v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09394v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence has shown promise in medical imaging, yet most existing systems lack flexibility, interpretability, and adaptability - challenges especially pronounced in ophthalmology, where diverse imaging modalities are essential. We present EyeAgent, the first agentic AI framework for comprehensive and interpretable clinical decision support in ophthalmology. Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09337v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09309v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Measuring GUI task difficulty is crucial for user behavior analysis and agent capability evaluation. Yet, existing benchmarks typically quantify difficulty based on motor actions (e.g., step counts), overlooking the cognitive demands underlying task completion. In this work, we propose Cognitive Chain, a novel framework that models task difficulty from a cognitive perspective. A cognitive chain decomposes the cognitive processes preceding a motor action into a sequence of cognitive steps (e.g., finding, deciding, computing), each with a difficulty index grounded in information theories. We develop an LLM-based method to automatically extract cognitive chains from task execution traces. Validation with linear regression shows that our estimated cognitive difficulty correlates well with user completion time (step-level R-square=0.46 after annotation). Assessment of state-of-the-art GUI agents shows reduced success on cognitively demanding tasks, revealing capability gaps and Human-AI consistency patterns. We conclude by discussing potential applications in agent training, capability assessment, and human-agent delegation optimization.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09240v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The problem of Motion Sickness (MS) among passengers significantly impacts the comfort and efficiency of In-Vehicle Infotainment Systems (IVIS) use. In this study, we innovatively designed SimPath, a visual design to effectively mitigate passengers' MS and boost their efficiency of using IVIS during driving. The study focuses on the problem of irregular motion conditions frequently encountered during actual driving. To validate the efficacy of this approach, two sets of real - vehicle experiments were carried out in real driving scenarios. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces passenger's MS level to a certain extent. However, due to divided attention from visual content, it does not directly improve the IVIS efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers crucial insights for the design of a more intelligent and user friendly IVIS, based on the discussion of the principle, providing strong theoretical support and practical guidance for the development of future IVIS in autonomous vehicles.",

      "title": "Plug-and-Play Clarifier: A Zero-Shot Multimodal Framework for Egocentric Intent Disambiguation",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.08971v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The performance of egocentric AI agents is fundamentally limited by multimodal intent ambiguity. This challenge arises from a combination of underspecified language, imperfect visual data, and deictic gestures, which frequently leads to task failure. Existing monolithic Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to resolve these multimodal ambiguous inputs, often failing silently or hallucinating responses. To address these ambiguities, we introduce the Plug-and-Play Clarifier, a zero-shot and modular framework that decomposes the problem into discrete, solvable sub-tasks. Specifically, our framework consists of three synergistic modules: (1) a text clarifier that uses dialogue-driven reasoning to interactively disambiguate linguistic intent, (2) a vision clarifier that delivers real-time guidance feedback, instructing users to adjust their positioning for improved capture quality, and (3) a cross-modal clarifier with grounding mechanism that robustly interprets 3D pointing gestures and identifies the specific objects users are pointing to. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework improves the intent clarification performance of small language models (4--8B) by approximately 30%, making them competitive with significantly larger counterparts. We also observe consistent gains when applying our framework to these larger models. Furthermore, our vision clarifier increases corrective guidance accuracy by over 20%, and our cross-modal clarifier improves semantic answer accuracy for referential grounding by 5%. Overall, our method provides a plug-and-play framework that effectively resolves multimodal ambiguity and significantly enhances user experience in egocentric interaction.",

Despite their prevalence, we lack an empirical understanding of how common image quality issues, like blur and misframing of items, affect the accuracy of VLM-generated captions and whether resulting captions meet BLV people's information needs. Grounded in a survey with 86 BLV people, we systematically evaluate how image quality issues affect captions generated by VLMs. We show that the best model recognizes products in images with no quality issues with 98% accuracy, but drops to 75% accuracy overall when quality issues are present, worsening considerably as issues compound. We discuss the need for model evaluations that center on disabled people's experiences throughout the process and offer concrete recommendations for HCI and ML researchers to make VLMs more reliable for BLV people.",

      "title": "Simulating Psychological Risks in Human-AI Interactions: Real-Case Informed Modeling of AI-Induced Addiction, Anorexia, Depression, Homicide, Psychosis, and Suicide",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.08880v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, their potential to exacerbate or trigger severe psychological harms remains poorly understood and inadequately tested. This paper presents a proactive methodology for systematically exploring psychological risks in simulated human-AI interactions based on documented real-world cases involving AI-induced or AI-exacerbated addiction, anorexia, depression, homicide, psychosis, and suicide. We collected and analyzed 18 reported real-world cases where AI interactions contributed to severe psychological outcomes. From these cases, we developed a process to extract harmful interaction patterns and assess potential risks through 2,160 simulated scenarios using clinical staging models. We tested four major LLMs across multi-turn conversations to identify where psychological risks emerge: which harm domains, conversation stages, and contexts reveal system vulnerabilities. Through the analysis of 157,054 simulated conversation turns, we identify critical gaps in detecting psychological distress, responding appropriately to vulnerable users, and preventing harm escalation. Regression analysis reveals variability across persona types: LLMs tend to perform worse with elderly users but better with low- and middle-income groups compared to high-income groups. Clustering analysis of harmful responses reveals a taxonomy of fifteen distinct failure patterns organized into four categories of AI-enabled harm. This work contributes a novel methodology for identifying psychological risks, empirical evidence of common failure modes across systems, and a classification of harmful AI response patterns in high-stakes human-AI interactions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.08763v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Immersive rooms are increasingly popular augmented reality systems that support multi-agent interactions within a virtual world. However, despite extensive content creation and technological developments, insights about perceptually-driven social dynamics, such as the complex movement patterns during virtual world navigation, remain largely underexplored. Computational models of motion dynamics can help us understand the underlying mechanism of human interaction in immersive rooms and develop applications that better support spatially distributed interaction. In this work, we propose a new agent-based model of emergent human motion dynamics. The model represents human agents as simple spatial geometries in the room that relocate and reorient themselves based on the salient virtual spatial objects they approach. Agent motion is modeled as an interactive process combining external diffusion-driven influences from the environment with internal self-propelling interactions among agents. Further, we leverage simulation-based inference (SBI) to show that the governing parameters of motion patterns can be estimated from simple observables. Our results indicate that the model successfully captures action-related agent properties but exposes local non-identifiability linked to environmental awareness. We argue that our simulation-based approach paves the way for creating adaptive, responsive immersive rooms -- spaces that adjust their interfaces and interactions based on human collective movement patterns and spatial attention.",

      "title": "ActiTect: A Generalizable Machine Learning Pipeline for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening through Standardized Actigraphy",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.05221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major prodromal marker of $\\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements, they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns. Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range = 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model using wearable devices.",

In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.",

      "title": "Fractal geometry predicts dynamic differences in structural and functional connectomes",
      "content": "arXiv:2505.11477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Understanding the intricate architecture of brain networks and its connection to brain function is essential for deciphering the underlying principles of cognition and disease. While traditional graph-theoretical measures have been widely used to characterize these networks, they often fail to fully capture the emergent properties of large-scale neural dynamics. Here, we introduce an alternative approach to quantify brain networks that is rooted in complex dynamics, fractal geometry, and asymptotic analysis. We apply these concepts to brain connectomes and demonstrate how quadratic iterations and geometric properties of Mandelbrot-like sets can provide novel insights into structural and functional network dynamics. Our findings reveal fundamental distinctions between structural (positive) and functional (signed) connectomes, such as the shift of cusp orientation and the variability in equi-M set geometry. Notably, structural connectomes exhibit more robust, predictable features, while functional connectomes show increased variability for non-trivial tasks. We further demonstrate that traditional graph-theoretical measures, when applied separately to the positive and negative sub-networks of functional connectomes, fail to fully capture their dynamic complexity. Instead, size and shape-based invariants of the equi-M set effectively differentiate between rest and emotional task states, which highlights their potential as superior markers of emergent network dynamics. These results suggest that incorporating fractal-based methods into network neuroscience provides a powerful tool for understanding how information flows in natural systems beyond static connectivity measures, while maintaining their simplicity.",
