      "content": "Objective. To determine whether the perceptual intensity of speech signals\u2014manipulated via loudness and dynamically adjusted through a brain state-dependent stimulation (BSDS) paradigm\u2014modulates neural speech tracking and short-term memory. Approach. We implemented an EEG brain state-dependent design in which real-time variations in alpha power were used to modulate the loudness of pre-recorded digits during a task modelled on the digit span test. Speech tracking was quantified using lagged Gaussian copula mutual information (2\u201310 Hz), and behavioural performance was assessed through recall accuracy. Main results. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that higher loudness would enhance speech tracking and memory via bottom\u2013up attention, digit recall accuracy was stable across loudness conditions. Speech tracking revealed an unexpected pattern: louder stimuli presented during high alpha power (low attention) elicited reduced tracking magnitudes and shorter peak latencies, whereas quieter stimuli delivered during low alpha power (high attention) produced stronger and more temporally extended tracking responses. Significance. These findings may suggest that internal attentional state, rather than external stimulus salience, plays a dominant role in shaping speech encoding. The study provides proof-of-concept evidence for BSDS in auditory paradigms, showing the importance of attentional fluctuations and stimulus loudness in determining the strength and timing of neural speech tracking, with implications for the design of adaptive speech-enhancement strategies.",

      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "title": "Perceptually-Guided Adjusted Teleporting: Perceptual Thresholds for Teleport Displacements in Virtual Environments",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.09632v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Teleportation is one of the most common locomotion techniques in virtual reality, yet its perceptual properties remain underexplored. While redirected walking research has shown that users' movements can be subtly manipulated without detection, similar imperceptible adjustments for teleportation have not been systematically investigated. This study examines the thresholds at which teleportation displacements become noticeable to users. We conducted a repeated-measures experiment in which participants' selected teleport destinations were altered in both direction (forwards, backwards) and at different ranges (small, large). Detection thresholds for these positional adjustments were estimated using a psychophysical staircase method with a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task. Results show that teleport destinations can be shifted without detection, with larger tolerances for backward adjustments and across longer teleport ranges. These findings establish baseline perceptual limits for redirected teleportation and highlight its potential as a design technique. Applications include supporting interpersonal distance management in social VR, guiding players toward objectives in games, and assisting novice users with navigation. By identifying the limits of imperceptible teleportation adjustments, this work extends redirection principles beyond walking to teleportation and opens new opportunities for adaptive and socially aware VR locomotion systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09620v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into news production, calls for transparency about the use of AI have gained considerable traction. Recent studies suggest that AI disclosures can lead to a ``transparency dilemma'', where disclosure reduces readers' trust. However, little is known about how the \\textit{level of detail} in AI disclosures influences trust and contributes to this dilemma within the news context. In this 3$\\times$2$\\times$2 mixed factorial study with 40 participants, we investigate how three levels of AI disclosures (none, one-line, detailed) across two types of news (politics and lifestyle) and two levels of AI involvement (low and high) affect news readers' trust. We measured trust using the News Media Trust questionnaire, along with two decision behaviors: source-checking and subscription decisions. Questionnaire responses and subscription rates showed a decline in trust only for detailed AI disclosures, whereas source-checking behavior increased for both one-line and detailed disclosures, with the effect being more pronounced for detailed disclosures. Insights from semi-structured interviews suggest that source-checking behavior was primarily driven by interest in the topic, followed by trust, whereas trust was the main factor influencing subscription decisions. Around two-thirds of participants expressed a preference for detailed disclosures, while most participants who preferred one-line indicated a need for detail-on-demand disclosure formats. Our findings show that not all AI disclosures lead to a transparency dilemma, but instead reflect a trade-off between readers' desire for more transparency and their trust in AI-assisted news content.",

      "title": "Technological Advances in Two Generations of Consumer-Grade VR Systems: Effects on User Experience and Task Performance",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.09610v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Integrated VR (IVR) systems consist of a head-mounted display (HMD) and body-tracking capabilities. They enable users to translate their physical movements into corresponding avatar movements in real-time, allowing them to perceive their avatars via the displays. Consumer-grade IVR systems have been available for 10 years, significantly fostering VR research worldwide. However, the effects of even apparently significant technological advances of IVR systems on user experience and the overall validity of prior embodiment research using such systems often remain unclear. We ran a user-centered study comparing two comparable IVR generations: a nearly 10-year-old hardware (HTC Vive, 6-point tracking) and a modern counterpart (HTC Vive Pro 2, 6-point tracking). To ensure ecological validity, we evaluated the systems in their commercially available, as-is configurations. In a 2x5 mixed design, participants completed five tasks covering different use cases on either the old or new system. We assessed presence, sense of embodiment, appearance and behavior plausibility, workload, task performance, and gathered qualitative feedback. Results showed no significant system differences, with only small effect sizes. Bayesian analysis further supported the null hypothesis, suggesting that the investigated generational hardware improvements offer limited benefits for user experience and task performance. For the 10-year generational step examined here, excluding potential technological progress in the necessary software components, this supports the validity of conclusions from prior work and underscores the applicability of older configurations for research in embodied VR.",

      "title": "Mikasa: A Character-Driven Emotional AI Companion Inspired by Japanese Oshi Culture",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.09208v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent progress in large language models and multimodal interaction has made it possible to develop AI companions that can have fluent and emotionally expressive conversations. However, many of these systems have problems keeping users satisfied and engaged over long periods. This paper argues that these problems do not come mainly from weak models, but from poor character design and unclear definitions of the user-AI relationship. I present Mikasa, an emotional AI companion inspired by Japanese Oshi culture-specifically its emphasis on long-term, non-exclusive commitment to a stable character-as a case study of character-driven companion design. Mikasa does not work as a general-purpose assistant or a chatbot that changes roles. Instead, Mikasa is designed as a coherent character with a stable personality and a clearly defined relationship as a partner. This relationship does not force exclusivity or obligation. Rather, it works as a reference point that stabilizes interaction norms and reduces the work users must do to keep redefining the relationship. Through an exploratory evaluation, I see that users describe their preferences using surface-level qualities such as conversational naturalness, but they also value relationship control and imaginative engagement in ways they do not state directly. These results suggest that character coherence and relationship definition work as latent structural elements that shape how good the interaction feels, without users recognizing them as main features. The contribution of this work is to show that character design is a functional part of AI companion systems, not just decoration. Mikasa is one example based on a specific cultural context, but the design principles-commitment to a consistent personality and clear relationship definition-can be used for many emotionally grounded AI companions.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09150v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate generative agent simulation (e.g., AI Town) to create a ``dynamic world'', holding immense value across entertainment and research. However, for non-experts, especially those without programming skills, it isn't easy to customize a visualizable environment by themselves. In this paper, we introduce World Craft, an agentic world creation framework to create an executable and visualizable AI Town via user textual descriptions. It consists of two main modules, World Scaffold and World Guild. World Scaffold is a structured and concise standardization to develop interactive game scenes, serving as an efficient scaffolding for LLMs to customize an executable AI Town-like environment. World Guild is a multi-agent framework to progressively analyze users' intents from rough descriptions, and synthesizes required structured contents (\\eg environment layout and assets) for World Scaffold . Moreover, we construct a high-quality error-correction dataset via reverse engineering to enhance spatial knowledge and improve the stability and controllability of layout generation, while reporting multi-dimensional evaluation metrics for further analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing commercial code agents (Cursor and Antigravity) and LLMs (Qwen3 and Gemini-3-Pro). in scene construction and narrative intent conveyance, providing a scalable solution for the democratization of environment creation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09053v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this study, we evaluate a locally-deployed large-language model (LLM) to convert unstructured endometriosis transvaginal ultrasound (eTVUS) scan reports into structured data for imaging informatics workflows. Across 49 eTVUS reports, we compared three LLMs (7B/8B and a 20B-parameter model) against expert human extraction. The 20B model achieved a mean accuracy of 86.02%, substantially outperforming smaller models and confirming the importance of scale in handling complex clinical text. Crucially, we identified a highly complementary error profile: the LLM excelled at syntactic consistency (e.g., date/numeric formatting) where humans faltered, while human experts provided superior semantic and contextual interpretation. We also found that the LLM's semantic errors were fundamental limitations that could not be mitigated by simple prompt engineering. These findings strongly support a human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflow in which the on-premise LLM serves as a collaborative tool, not a full replacement. It automates routine structuring and flags potential human errors, enabling imaging specialists to focus on high-level semantic validation. We discuss implications for structured reporting and interactive AI systems in clinical practice.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09048v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extended Reality (XR) affords an enhanced sense of bodily presence that supports experiential modes of comprehension and affective engagement which exceed the possibilities of conventional information delivery. Nevertheless, the psychological processes engendered by XR, and the manner in which these processes inform subsequent behavioural intentions, remain only partially delineated. The present study addresses this issue within an applied context by comparing non-immersive 2D viewing advertising with immersive XR experiential advertising. We examined whether XR strengthens internal responses to a product, specifically perceived comprehension and empathy, and whether these responses, in turn, influence the behavioural outcome of purchase intention. A repeated-measures two-way ANOVA demonstrated a significant main effect of advertising modality, with XR yielding higher ratings on all evaluative dimensions. Mediation analysis further indicated that the elevation in purchase intention was mediated by empathy, whereas no significant mediating effect was observed for comprehension within the scope of this study. These findings suggest that immersive XR experiences augment empathic engagement with virtual products, and that this enhanced empathy plays a pivotal role in shaping subsequent behavioural intentions.",

Organizations successfully implement XR in isolated pilots, yet struggle to scale these into sustained operational deployment, a phenomenon we characterize as the ``Pilot Trap.'' This study examines this phenomenon through a qualitative ecosystem analysis of 17 expert interviews across technology providers, solution integrators, and industrial adopters. We identify a ``Great Inversion'' in adoption barriers: critical constraints have shifted from technological maturity to organizational readiness (e.g., change management, key performance indicator alignment, and political resistance). While hardware ergonomics and usability remain relevant, our findings indicate that systemic misalignments between stakeholder incentives are the primary cause of friction preventing enterprise integration. We conclude that successful industrial XR adoption requires a shift from technology-centric piloting to a problem-first, organizational transformation approach, necessitating explicit ecosystem-level coordination.",

      "title": "Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback",
      "content": "arXiv:2502.20580v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.",

According to this theory, the receptive fields are modelled as velocity-adapted affine Gaussian derivatives for different image velocities and different degrees of elongation. By probing such idealized receptive field models of visual neurons to moving sine waves with different angular frequencies and image velocities, we characterize the computational models to a structurally similar probing method as is used for characterizing the direction and speed selective properties of biological neurons.\n  By comparison to results of neurophysiological measurements of direction and speed selectivity for biological neurons in the primary visual cortex, we find that our theoretical results are consistent with (i) velocity-tuned visual neurons that are sensitive to particular motion directions and speeds, and (ii) different visual neurons having broader vs. sharper direction and speed selective properties. Our theoretical results in combination with results from neurophysiological characterizations of motion-sensitive visual neurons are also consistent with a previously formulated hypothesis that the simple cells in the primary visual cortex ought to be covariant under local Galilean transformations, so as to enable processing of visual stimuli with different motion directions and speeds.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.16070v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Turning rich neuroimaging data into mechanistic insight remains challenging. Statistical models capture associations but remain largely agnostic to underlying mechanisms. Biophysical models embody candidate mechanisms but remain difficult to deploy without specialized expertise. Here, we present a hypothesis-first framework recasting model specifications as testable mechanistic hypotheses and streamlines the procedure for rejecting inappropriate hypotheses before moving to typical analyses. The key innovation is an expectation of model behavior under feature generalization constraints: we compute the model's expected $Y$ output across the parameter space based on the likelihood for a broader/distinct feature $Z$. Mirror statistical models are derived from these expected outputs and compared to the empirical ones with standard statistics. In synthetic experiments, our framework rejected mis-specified hypotheses and penalized unnecessary degrees of freedom while retaining valid hypotheses. These results demonstrate a practical hypothesis-driven approach for using mechanistic models in neuroimaging without requiring advanced training, complementing traditional analyses.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08855v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Efficient resolution of neuroinflammation and debris clearance is a key determinant of successful central nervous system regeneration. Regenerative vertebrates such as Danio rerio often exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance than mammals, yet the molecular determinants underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S are central regulators of phagocytosis and immune resolution in the nervous system, but whether intrinsic structural properties of these receptor-ligand complexes contribute to regenerative efficiency has not been systematically explored.\n  Here, we present a comparative in silico analysis of TAM receptors and ligands from zebrafish, human, and mouse, integrating sequence evolution, high-confidence structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic analysis. Despite substantial sequence divergence, ligand-binding domains display strong structural conservation, supporting a conserved global mode of TAM-ligand engagement. At the interface level, zebrafish complexes show enhanced electrostatic contributions and increased salt-bridge density, particularly in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction. Residue-level electrostatic analysis reveals clustered interface hotspots that are spatially conserved across species despite evolutionary rewiring of individual contacts.\n  Together, these results suggest that TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are evolutionarily tuned through subtle electrostatic and geometric optimization rather than large-scale structural changes, providing a conserved yet adaptable framework for species-specific modulation of phagocytic signaling.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09320v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cerebellar-like networks, in which input activity patterns are separated by projection to a much higher-dimensional space before classification, are a recurring neurobiological motif, present in the cerebellum, dentate gyrus, insect olfactory system, and electrosensory system of the electric fish. Their relatively well-understood design presents a promising test-case for probing principles of biological learning. The circuits' expansive projections have long been modelled as random, enabling effective general purpose pattern separation. However, electron-microscopy studies have discovered interesting hints of structure in both the fly mushroom body and mouse cerebellum. Recent numerical work suggested that this non-random connectivity enables the circuit to prioritise learning of some, presumably natural, tasks over others. Here, rather than numerical results, we present a robust mathematical link between the observed connectivity patterns and the cerebellar circuit's learning ability. In particular, we extend a simplified kernel regression model of the system and use recent machine learning theory results to relate connectivity to learning. We find that the reported structure in the projection weights shapes the network's inductive bias in intuitive ways: functions are easier to learn if they depend on inputs that are oversampled, or on collections of neurons that tend to connect to the same hidden layer neurons. Our approach is analytically tractable and pleasingly simple, and we hope it continues to serve as a model for understanding the functional implications of other processing motifs in cerebellar-like networks.",

      "content": "Adverse childhood experiences, such as violence, abuse, and neglect, are increasingly recognized as significant modifiers of brain development. Here, we tested whether adults with histories of childhood trauma, but without psychiatric comorbidities exhibit altered excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, as indicated by electroencephalography (EEG) signatures. Participants, divided into low-trauma and high-trauma groups, underwent two experimental conditions: eyes-closed resting-state recording and a reaction-time task with visual stimuli. From these data, we computed 1/f spectral slopes, a widely used electrophysiological marker of E/I balance; we complemented these analyses with a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) microcircuit model combined with a biophysically grounded forward-modeling approach to simulate realistic brain signals and derive E/I balance estimates. Group comparisons for both slopes and E/I estimates revealed significant resting-state differences, characterized by a shift toward increased neuronal excitation in the high-trauma group. The high-trauma group exhibited altered stimulus-related 1/f slope dynamics relative to the pre-stimulus baseline, reflecting attenuated neuronal inhibition. E/I ratio measures were not significantly correlated with participants' transient affective states. Together, these findings suggest that childhood trauma is associated with enduring, trait-like alterations in cortical E/I balance that extend beyond affective state and manifest across both resting and task-related brain dynamics.",
