      "title": "Sox8 and Sox9 regulate differentiation and nuclear positioning of retinal Muller glia.",
      "content": "Temporal patterning of retinal progenitor cells governs the sequential generation of retinal cell types, with gliogenesis occurring late in development. Sox8 and Sox9, members of the SoxE transcription factor family, are highly expressed in late-stage retinal progenitor cells and mature Muller glia, yet their functional roles remain incompletely defined. Here we employed gain- and loss-of-function approaches, single-cell multiomic profiling, and injury models to investigate Sox8/9 function. Overexpression of Sox8 and/or Sox9 in early-stage RPCs suppressed early-born cell fates and promoted photoreceptor generation, consistent with a role in late-stage temporal identity. Conversely, conditional deletion of Sox8 and/or Sox9 in late-stage progenitors did not impair Muller glia specification but caused radial displacement of Muller glia nuclei into the outer retina and modest changes in glial gene expression. Loss of Sox8/9 in mature Muller glia modestly increased proliferation post-injury without inducing neurogenic competence. These findings suggest that Sox8/9 are dispensable for gliogenesis and repression of neurogenic competence but are essential for proper laminar positioning and maturation of retinal Muller glia.",

      "title": "GBA1 deficiency differentially affects endolysosomal trafficking in neurons versus astrocytes",
      "content": "Mutations in the gene glucosidase, beta acid 1 (GBA1) are the strongest genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD) and are associated with faster disease progression. GBA1 is expressed in all cell types of the central nervous system, with some evidence supporting higher expression in glial cells than neurons. To elucidate possible specific functions in neurons versus glia, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from an individual with PD heterozygous for the GBA1 pathogenic null variant IVS2+1 (GBA1IVS/+), homozygous GBA1 IVS2+1 isogenic to GBA1IVS/+ (GBA1IVS/IVS) and a healthy unaffected age- and sex-matched individual (GBA1+/+). GBA1 expression was reduced in GBA1IVS/+ and GBA1IVS/IVS neurons and astrocytes. Endolysosomal trafficking was significantly altered in GBA1-deficient neurons with enlarged early and recycling endosome and lysosome compartments in neurons but not in astrocytes. High molecular weight oligomerization of -synuclein and phosphorylated Ser129 -synuclein were present in GBA1IVS/+ and GBA1IVS/IVS neurons but not in GBA1+/+ neurons, or in GBA1-deficient or GBA1+/+ astrocytes. Transcriptomic analysis of GBA1-deficient neurons and astrocytes revealed cell-type specific profiles. GBA1 deficiency in neurons downregulated immune response and upregulated cholesterol synthesis pathways, while GBA1 deficiency in astrocytes downregulated genes associated with translation and upregulated genes involved in extracellular matrix biogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis also suggests that GBA1 deficiency induces neurotoxic reactivity in astrocytes. Together, these findings indicate that GBA1 deficiency has cell type-specific effects, with increased neuronal vulnerability to endolysosomal trafficking leading to -synucleinopathy while GBA1 deficiency in astrocytes leads to increased neurotoxic reactivity independent of endolysosomal trafficking and -synucleinopathy.",

      "title": "History-dependent Biases in Perceptual Decisions Depend on NMDA Receptors",
      "content": "Perceptual decisions are governed not only by current sensory input but also by the history of previous stimuli, choices, or outcomes. Such history-dependent biases evolve across multiple timescales ranging from seconds to minutes. Synaptic plasticity is one possible mechanism mediating such effects. The by N-methyl-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor is critical for synaptic plasticity, and indirect evidence points to its role in the generation of history-dependent biases. Here, we pharmacologically blocked NMDA receptors in healthy human participants performing a two-alternative visual decision-making task. Participants' choices were biased by the accumulation of fluctuating sensory evidence within each trial as well as the accumulation of across-trial sequences of stimuli, which enabled them to adapt to changing stimulus statistics across blocks. NMDA receptor blockade reduced the task-adaptive across trials, history-dependent biases. In contrast, enhancing GABA-A receptor activity in the same participants increased the transiency of the within-trial evidence accumulation dynamics. Our findings provide direct evidence for the importance of NMDA receptor function in history-dependent biases in the human brain.",

      "title": "Explicit reward stabilizes motor output by attenuating sensory prediction error driven learning",
      "content": "Motor adaptation driven by sensory prediction errors (SPEs) is often regarded as an automatic, implicit process that operates independent of reward. However, in most past work, reward and performance outcomes (success / failure) have been intrinsically confounded, making it unclear whether explicitly delivered reward per se influences SPE-driven learning. Here, we used an error-clamp paradigm to dissociate reward from both error and task outcome, enabling us to directly test whether explicit reward modulates implicit adaptation. Participants performed reaching movements under clamped visual feedback that produced a constant SPE, while being instructed to ignore the cursor. In two experiments, reward was delivered when the unseen hand successfully intersected the reach target. In an eight-target task, reward did not alter the overall magnitude or time course of adaptation. However, trial-level analyses revealed that rewarded movements were followed by smaller trial-to-trial updates, reduced variability, and a cumulative suppression of adaptive adjustments. Consistent with this result, individuals who experienced reward more frequently exhibited less asymptotic learning. In our second experiment using a simplified, two-target task, these trial-level effects accumulated to produce robust reductions in both asymptotic adaptation and aftereffects in the rewarded groups. Across both experiments, longer streaks of rewarded trials predicted progressively weaker SPE-driven updating. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that implicit adaptation is not insulated from reward signals. Instead, explicit reward appears to attenuate sensitivity to SPEs, stabilizing motor output particularly when the task structure allows consistent action-reward associations. We conclude that motivational signals can gate the expression of error-driven motor adaptation.",

      "content": "The human prefrontal cortex (PFC), whose laminar organization is essential for cognitive function, is among the first regions to show age-related functional decline. Single-cell sequencing studies revealed cell type-dependent aging effects but lacked spatial specificity. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) advanced our molecular understanding of the human PFC, yet whether aging-driven changes differ across PFC layers remains unclear. Here, we performed whole-transcriptome ST on postmortem PFC from 37 individuals across the adult lifespan. We mapped cortical layers and revealed aging mechanisms across layers. This represents one of the largest and most comprehensive lifespan ST analysis of the human PFC brain, offering crucial insight into how the brain ages and identifying potential molecular targets to mitigate cognitive aging and extend healthspan.",

Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",
