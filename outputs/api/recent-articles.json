      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Autocrine feedback maintains homeostatic neuropeptide expression in a peptidergichub neuron",
      "content": "Neuronal circuits sustain stable function by self-regulating their gene expression and neurosecretion. Patterns for autocrine feedback by neuropeptides are widespread across nervous systems, but how they contribute to neuronal homeostasis remains poorly understood. Here, we identify an autocrine homeostatic mechanism in a C. elegans peptidergic hub neuron. FLP-1 neuropeptide release activates the inhibitory receptor DMSR-7 on the AVK hub neurons to self-regulate flp-1 transcription, dense-core vesicle accumulation, and peptide secretion. We show that a parallel PDF-1/PDFR-1 pathway drives flp-1 expression, establishing a \"push-and-pull\" peptidergic feedback on the AVK neurons. AVK's peptidergic output also depends on the number of FLP-1 peptides encoded in its precursor, revealing a dosage mechanism in behavioral regulation. Moreover, flp-1 expression coordinates transcript levels of additional neuropeptides in AVK. These findings uncover FLP-1 as a self-regulating homeostatic controller within a peptidergic hub neuron and illustrate how precursor-encoded redundancy supports stable yet adaptable circuit states.",

      "title": "3D Light Sheet Microscopy Reveals Aging Osteoarthritis-associated Joint-innervated Nerve Remodeling in Mouse Knee Joints",
      "content": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent age related joint disease-causing chronic pain. This study investigated how nociceptive and sympathetic nerve innervation in the mouse knee joint changes with age and OA progression, and how these changes relate to pain and disease severity. Methods: Thirty-eight mice were assigned to four groups: young male (My), aged male (Ma), young female (Fy), and aged female (Fa). Pain sensitivity was evaluated via Pressure Application Measurement (PAM), and joint damage was graded using OARSI scoring. CGRP and PIEZO2 expressions in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were also assessed. We employed iDISCO tissue clearing and 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize total (PGP9.5), nociceptive (CGRP), and sympathetic (TH) nerve fibers in anterior regions of mouse knee joints. A MATLAB-based tool quantified nerve architecture. Results: The Ma group displayed the highest OA severity and markedly lower mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared with My, suggesting an age effect on pain-related behavior. This phenotype was accompanied by a higher total PGP9.5; nerve fiber density in the knee joint and increased CGRP nociceptive innervation. In contrast, female mice showed no age-dependent change in PAM withdrawal thresholds, consistent with preserved cartilage integrity and stable OARSI scores, and no detectable age-related differences in PGP9.5; or CGRP; innervation. The TH; sympathetic fiber distribution was comparable across sexes and ages. Consistent with joint-level findings, DRG analyses demonstrated increased CGRP and PIEZO2 expression in the Ma group, whereas females exhibited no significant change. Conclusion: Enhanced nociceptive but not sympathetic nerve remodeling in knee cavities is associated with increased OA severity and knee pain in the Ma group. These findings emphasize the role of peripheral sensory plasticity in OA pain and demonstrate the value of 3D imaging for visualizing neuroanatomical changes in joint disorders.",

The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

Why? well, we didn't manage to get sufficient traction in our former strategy, so we decided to pivot.
