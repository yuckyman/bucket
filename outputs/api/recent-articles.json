      "title": "Cortex-Wide Preservation of Multi-Stimulus Information across Degrees of Network Synchronization",
      "content": "Sensory-evoked cortical responses vary with global network dynamics, yet the link between cortical state and stimulus processing remains unclear. Here, we introduce a paradigm that jointly decodes stimulus identity and network state from wide-field calcium imaging in mice undergoing multisensory and optogenetic stimulation across isoflurane-induced transitions from compartmentalized to synchronized activity. Effective dimensionality, a summary measure of network complexity, correlated well with anesthesia depth, while non-linear contrastive learning achieved >97% stimulus decoding accuracy across all states. Individual cortical regions maintained [&ge;]82.5% accuracy even during deep anesthesia with prominent slow waves. Preservation of stimulus-specific information extended throughout the cortex, demonstrating that distinct representations remain decodable within synchronized networks. Direct optogenetic cortical stimulation exhibited state-invariant decoding performance, contrasting with anesthesia-dependent decline observed for sensory stimuli. Multi-stimulus cortical representations remain decodable across varying levels of network synchronization, with implications for brain-machine interfaces and clinical tools that assess preserved cortical responsiveness under variable arousal conditions.",

      "content": "Motivated by the brain's extraordinary processing abilities, the promise of queryable neural models, and the potential for biohybrid computing, we present Living Neurosheets: practical, malleable, and modular platforms for the realization of complex in vitro living neural architectures, bio-inspired or beyond evolutionary precedent. By innervating porous sheets, substrates employed for millennia in the form of paper are here reimagined, inheriting neural function and exceptional versatility. Through pre-programmed porosity, deposited neurons are held in place for durable and reproducible spatial control. By cutting, folding, and stacking, elaborate neural topologies can be designed, batch fabricated, and modularly composed. In combination with tissue-matched optoelectronics, neurosheets deliver a powerful foundation for the multimodal interrogation of neural motifs. This is illustrated via planar tissues, gyri-inspired manifolds, and laminar cortical mimics, where we demonstrate control over entrainment, synchronization, propagation, suppression, and augmentation dynamics, recapitulating fundamental building blocks of in vivo neural activity.",

      "title": "tACS induces state-dependent shifts in inhibitory phase preference consistent with phase precession",
      "content": "Phase-dependent modulation of motor inhibition suggests that oscillatory timing plays a key role in inhibitory control. Here we show that rhythmic brain stimulation can selectively alter this timing in a manner consistent with phase precession. Participants performed an anticipatory stop-signal task while receiving 20 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the pre-supplementary motor area, with stop signals presented at defined phases of the stimulation waveform. An additional control experiment with no tACS was conducted, in which the stop signal phase was derived post-hoc from the ongoing EEG. In both tACS and control sessions, stopping efficacy varied sinusoidally with beta phase, confirming that inhibitory control is intrinsically phase-dependent. During tACS, however, the phase associated with the strongest inhibition advanced progressively across the session by about 180 degrees, and this effect was specific to failed-stop trials. No comparable shift occurred without stimulation. These findings indicate that rhythmic drive can bias the temporal phase at which inhibition is most effective when the brain is in an error-prone state, revealing a state-dependent, precession-like reorganization of inhibitory timing. We propose that tACS interacts with error-related plasticity to promote gradual phase advancement, placing the system within spike-timing-dependent learning windows, whereas intrinsic fluctuations alone appear insufficient to facilitate cumulative precession. More broadly, these results suggest that phase precession may represent a general coding principle extending beyond hippocampal circuits, enabling the motor system to adaptively adjust inhibitory control through oscillatory timing mechanisms.",

      "title": "Lifelong maintenance of locomotion by embryonically active dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Locomotor skills arise early in life and must be maintained throughout the lifespan, yet how this continuity is achieved despite major neural remodeling remains unclear. Using Drosophila, which undergoes complete metamorphosis, we show that dopamine neurons (DANs) are active during the embryonic stage and that this early activity is essential for locomotion across all developmental stages and adulthood. Through stage-specific behavioral assays, optogenetics, in vivo brain imaging, and fluorescent neuronal tracking, we identify a subset of ventral nervous system (VNS) DANs that modulate locomotor function throughout life. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that they maintain expression of developmental transcription factors. Knocking down these factors in post-mitotic VNS DANs impairs adult locomotion. These findings uncover a previously overlooked function for embryonic DANs and suggest that stable locomotion during nervous system maturation relies on persistent developmental regulator expression coupled with structural remodeling.",

      "title": "Higher inter-trial latency variability contributes to reduced visual EEG responses in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Patients with schizophrenia show strong impairments in visual backward masking, which are associated with reduced EEG N1 responses. However, it is currently unclear whether reduced N1 amplitudes in patients reflect attenuated neural responses or increased inter-trial latency variability, as both can lead to reduced trial-averaged responses. Previous studies using trial-averaged data cannot distinguish between these two possibilities. Here, we estimated inter-trial latency variability of the visual N1 component and found significantly increased variability in patients compared to controls. Inter-trial latency-variability was a strong predictor of the N1 amplitude in both groups. Importantly, after accounting for the effect of latency variability in the group comparison, patients continued to exhibit significantly reduced N1 amplitudes, although the effect size diminished from large to medium. These findings indicate that both higher latency variability and attenuated neural responses contribute to visual processing deficits in schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Reorganisation of Cortico-Hippocampal White Matter Pathways in Healthy Ageing: Evidence for Paradoxical Shifts in Structural Connectivity.",
      "content": "The hippocampus plays a central role in episodic memory and has been the focus of extensive research over past decades. A substantial body of work has demonstrated that age-related memory decline is linked to changes in how the hippocampus functionally interacts with distributed brain networks. While functional connectivity changes in ageing are well documented, relatively little is known about alterations in the structural connectivity (SC) of the hippocampus, despite its foundational role in supporting communication across neural systems. In this study, we combined high-quality data from the Human Connectome Project and advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) methods to investigate age-related changes in hippocampal SC. Using a recently developed tractography pipeline that allows greater anatomical specificity than conventional approaches, we systematically compared connectivity patterns between younger (26-30 years) and older (56-60 years) adults. Results revealed reduced hippocampal SC with the entorhinal cortex and medial parietal cortices in older participants, alongside increased SC with anterior temporal areas. This paradoxical pattern suggests that ageing is associated with both vulnerability and reorganisation of hippocampal networks, with increased hippocampal-temporal connectivity potentially reflecting compensatory plasticity in response to reduced posterior medial connection. These findings provide in vivo evidence of cortico-hippocampal structural reorganisation in late middle age, a critical period when pathological processes such as tau deposition are already detectable in cognitively healthy individuals. More broadly, they demonstrate the power of our anatomically refined tractography pipeline as a proof of concept for detecting subtle, regionally specific changes in hippocampal pathway density. This approach holds promise for charting normative ageing trajectories and identifying early biomarkers of vulnerability and compensation in memory-related networks.",
