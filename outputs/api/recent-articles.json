      "title": "Light-inducible proximity labelling in vivo captures sex-specific RNA at excitatory synapses",
      "content": "Local RNA regulation is essential for synaptic plasticity, yet the full repertoire of RNA species and associated isoforms within specific synaptic compartments in vivo has yet to be determined. Existing RNA profiling approaches lack the spatial and temporal precision needed to resolve RNA repertoires restricted to cell-type specific synaptic compartments. To overcome this challenge, we developed PSD95 Haloseq, a light induced proximity labelling technique that, when combined with long read sequencing, selectively captures all post-synaptic full length RNA species in the excitatory post synaptic compartment. Here, we applied this approach to investigate sex differences in RNA expression within excitatory synapses following exposure to an associative fear learning task in C57/Bl6 mice. We found dramatic sex differences in pseudogene and protein coding RNA expression, which are most abundant in females, with males exhibiting multiple noncoding RNA classes, including lncRNA, snoRNA, and rRNA. Females generally showed more 3' UTR expression, and there was widespread differential exon usage following fear conditioning, including 179 isoforms in males, 69 in females, with no significant gene level differential expression, indicating that behavioural state modifies sex specific isoform usage rather than overall transcript abundance. Our discovery that synaptic RNA composition is dynamic, sexually dimorphic, and profoundly shaped by experience, offers new insight into previously inaccessible mechanisms underlying sex differences in fear-related learning and memory. PSD95 Halo seq is therefore a powerful method for the precise spatiotemporal identification of compartment- and cell type specific RNA.",

      "title": "Chondroitin 4-sulphate depletion enhances synaptic plasticity and memory in aging",
      "content": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialised extracellular matrix structures enriched in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), are key regulators of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Aging is characterised by a shift in chondroitin sulphate composition toward increased chondroitin-4-sulfation (C4S) and reduced C6S, a pattern associated with declining cognitive flexibility. Here, we investigated how selective reduction of C4S affects PNN structure, PV-interneuron connectivity, and cognitive performance across the lifespan. Conditional deletion of the C4-sulfotransferase Chst11 markedly reduced C4S levels and diminished dendritic PNN complexity while preserving somatic PNN structure. This partial destabilisation of PNNs increased excitatory synaptic input onto PV interneurons in both young and aged mice, without major alterations in basal hippocampal transmission or long-term potentiation. Behaviourally, Chst11 knockout mice showed robust and persistent protection against age-related cognitive decline. Working memory performance remained stable across aging, short-term spatial memory was enhanced from early adulthood onward, and object recognition memory was significantly prolonged at all retention delays, even in old age. Sociability and social novelty preference were also preserved longer in aging knockouts compared with controls. These improvements occurred despite an overall preservation of PNN architecture, indicating that modifying sulphation rather than removing CSPGs is sufficient to enhance plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that reducing C4S through Chst11 deletion confers long-lasting enhancements in cognitive function and mitigates aging-related decline. Targeting CS-GAG sulphation patterns may therefore represent a promising strategy for maintaining cognitive resilience and restoring plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative conditions.",

      "title": "Diurnality reconfigures circadian network dynamics in the suprachiasmatic nucleus",
      "content": "Diurnal and nocturnal mammals occupy opposite temporal niches, but whether the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, follows the same intrinsic rules for timing adjustment and network coordination across species is unknown. Because SCN clock gene rhythms and population-level activity measurements look broadly similar across species, the prevailing interpretation in comparative studies has been that temporal niche differences are implemented upstream or downstream of the SCN. However, these coarse readouts do not test how clock resetting depends on circadian phase or how neuronal timing is coordinated across SCN space. Here, we combined long-duration ex vivo SCN recordings with optogenetic stimulation to compare SCN network dynamics in the nocturnal mouse (Mus musculus) and the diurnal four-striped grass mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio). Rhabdomys SCN molecular clock rhythms exhibited a longer intrinsic period and, under the same daily stimulation protocol, converged on a larger absolute phase angle relative to the stimulus. Molecular clock phase response curves differed in overall structure across circadian time between species, including pronounced early subjective day delays in Rhabdomys when Mus responses were minimal. Phase mapping of single-cell SCN calcium rhythms revealed species-specific spatial timing organization, with a graded dorsomedial-to-ventrolateral phase progression in Rhabdomys and a sharper transition in Mus. The Mus and Rhabdomys SCN can thus appear similar by coarse readouts yet diverge in phase-dependent molecular clock resetting and network timing organization. These results indicate that models placing temporal niche divergence solely outside the SCN are mechanistically incomplete.",

      "title": "Divergent Electrophysiological Responses in the Human Hippocampus During Verbal Memory Processing",
      "content": "The profile of electrophysiological responses in the human hippocampus (HPC) during verbal memory processing has remained complex and unclear. Here, we studied 26 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes across 187 HPC sites (50% left, 2-18 per patient). During memory encoding and retrieval, a subset of HPC responsive sites demonstrated increased ripple events, along with elevated high-frequency (HFA >50 Hz), and low-frequency (LFA 1-8 Hz) activity. A nearly equal number of sites showed no changes in ripple rate but increased LFA power and a delayed response-locked decrease in HFA power. More importantly, both successful encoding as well as recognition of remembered words were strongly associated with the coordination of the timing of LFA and HFA increases across the two clusters of responsive HPC sites. Using direct cortical electrical stimulations, we confirmed overlapping, but partially distinct, cortical connections to the functionally distinct HPC clusters. Our findings suggest a mesoscale mosaic functional organization within the human HPC where adjacent sites with divergent electrophysiological responses may have specialized roles during verbal memory processing. More importantly, our findings suggest that successful human memory depends on the coordination of the timing of low and high frequency local fields generated across these functionally divergent neuronal population sites.",

      "title": "LSD Reconfigures Cortical Dynamics Through Faster Brain Rhythms and Increased Fractal Dimension",
      "content": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) profoundly alters conscious experience, yet the electrophysiological mechanisms by which it reshapes neural dynamics remain incompletely understood. A hallmark of psychedelic states is widespread cortical desynchronization, typically inferred from reductions in spectral power, but whether such effects reflect genuine weakening of neural oscillations or are confounded by shifts in oscillatory peak frequencies remains unresolved. Here, we address this gap by combining source-resolved magnetoencephalography (MEG), spectral parameterization, temporal complexity metrics, and interpretable machine learning in an LSD versus placebo design, with and without music. We show that LSD induces robust, spatially structured increases in alpha and beta peak frequencies alongside genuine attenuation of oscillatory power, with these effects displaying partly dissociable cortical patterns. Beyond rhythmic activity, LSD is associated with flattening of the aperiodic 1/f spectral slope and increased neural signal complexity and fractality, preferentially affecting sensory, language, emotion, and imagery-related networks while sparing motor cortex. Machine-learning analyses further identify peak-frequency shifts, aperiodic parameters, and complexity measures as key discriminators of the psychedelic state. Music does not robustly amplify these neural signatures and instead shows a trend toward attenuation. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive electrophysiological account of how LSD reorganizes large-scale human brain dynamics and highlight features that may differentiate its neural signature from that of other psychedelics.",

      "title": "Individual Dynamics in Stress-Related Pain Responses",
      "content": "Background: Stress and pain are two adaptive mechanisms, driving human behavior and cognition. They are bidirectionally related, and modulating factors such as sleep or physical activity were identified. However, how stable individual differences in pain-related distress, including individual dispositions for pain catastrophizing, and person-specific pain sensitivities relate to the strength of stress responses remains unclear. This preregistered study closes this gap by investigating how trait pain-related distress and pain sensitivity changes relate to individuals stress response. Methods: Trait pain-related distress was assessed in 148 healthy males with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and the Fear of Pain Questionnaire. Baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, alpha-amylase, and cortisol were obtained as well as initial heat pain thresholds and tolerances. One participant group underwent the Maastricht Acute Stress Task, while a control group performed the placebo version of this task, and consecutively all stress- and experimental pain indicators were examined again. Results: Individuals with lower kinesiophobia demonstrated higher stress-induced increases in alpha-amylase. Furthermore, stress-induced changes in pain sensitivity showed high individual variability, but were not associated with the stress response. Finally, in individuals with a higher tendency to catastrophize and to fear pain, stronger alpha-amylase increases were associated with larger post-stressor increases in pain threshold, indicating reduced pain sensitivity. Conclusion: Our study suggests that stable individual differences influence the stress-pain link beyond physiology. This underscores the importance of considering trait differences in future research on stress-pain interactions with the goal of better tailoring preventions and treatments for patients with chronic pain.",

      "title": "Machine learning-based image analysis of Parkinson's disease iPS-derived neurons predicts genotype and reveals mitochondria-lysosome abnormalities",
      "content": "Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction are central features of Parkinson's disease (PD) across major genetic forms including PRKN, SNCA, and LRRK2. We applied cell morphomics, a machine-learning-based framework combining high-content imaging with quantitative feature extraction, to analyse mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology at single-cell resolution in iPS cell-derived cortical neurons from PD patients and healthy controls (13 lines total). Supervised machine-learning models distinguished PD neurons from controls with high accuracy (AUC = 0.87) and reliably separated individual genotypes. Feature importance and attribution analysis revealed genotype-specific organelle biases, with mitochondrial features dominating classification in PRKN neurons, balanced mitochondrial and lysosomal contributions in SNCA neurons, and a greater lysosomal contribution in LRRK2 neurons. Multi-class models retained strong performance, and findings were reproduced across two independent laboratories using different dyes and imaging conditions. These results demonstrate that morphomics provides a robust and scalable framework to quantify genotype-specific organelle abnormalities in PD neurons and supports its application for cellular stratification and biomarker discovery.",

      "title": "Proactive visual and motor prioritization differentially scale with cue reliability",
      "content": "Environmental cues enable the brain to anticipate and prepare for upcoming behavior, such as by selectively prioritizing relevant visual representations and associated action plans in working memory in service of an imminent task. While it has been demonstrated that neural dynamics of visual and motor prioritization each scale with cue reliability, studies to date tracked either visual or motor prioritization in isolation. It therefore remains unknown whether visual and motor prioritization scale similarly or differently with cue reliability. To fill this gap, we manipulated cue reliability (100%, 80%, 60%) in a visual-motor working-memory task that uniquely enabled us to isolate the neural dynamics associated with visual and motor prioritization in anticipation of an imminent working-memory task. EEG measurements in male and female human volunteers revealed how cue reliability differentially drives visual and motor prioritization. While the strength and timing of visual prioritization were largely invariant to cue reliability, motor prioritization profoundly scaled with cue reliability and developed more gradually with lower certainty. These findings show that visual and motor prioritization in working memory are differentially susceptible to the certainty conveyed by environmental cues, and suggest that motor prioritization may be more cautious in nature.",
