      "title": "mTORC1-Dependent Signaling in Layer 5b Neurons Is Required for Memory Consolidation",
      "content": "Memory consolidation relies on activity-dependent neuronal plasticity, particularly in deep-layer cortical neurons that integrate long-range inputs from medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. In the neocortex, apical tuft dendrites of layer 5b pyramidal neurons receive direct input from the MTL within cortical layer 1, and their activation is critical for associative learning. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable learning-induced plasticity in these neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that activity-dependent, mTORC1-regulated translation in layer 5b neurons contributes to learning and memory. Using in vivo paradigms such as exposure to an enriched environment (EE) and in vitro models of network activation by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP), combined with cell type-specific translational profiling (RiboTag), we identify candidate mRNAs associated with experience-dependent plasticity. We further show that pharmacological inhibition of canonical mTORC1 signaling during memory-relevant tasks abrogated memory consolidation. Our findings identify the mTORC1 pathway as a central regulator of learning-induced protein translation and cortical plasticity.",

      "title": "Serotonin Engages Divergent 5-HT Receptor Pathways for Cell Type-Resolved Modulation of Prefrontal Layer 5 Microcircuits",
      "content": "Background and Purpose: Serotonin (5-HT) is a key neuromodulator in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), yet its cell type-specific effects across excitatory and inhibitory microcircuits remain incompletely understood. We aimed to determine how 5-HT shapes intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission in defined neuronal populations of the medial PFC (mPFC). Experimental Approach: We performed whole-cell recordings from morphologically and electrophysiologically characterised layer 5 (L5) neurons in rat mPFC. Pyramidal neurons were classified into adaptive-spiking high input resistance (ASH), adaptive-spiking low input resistance (ASL), and regular-spiking (RS) types; interneurons were categorised as non-fast-spiking (nFS), regular-fast-spiking (rFS), and stuttering-fast-spiking (sFS) interneurons. These cell types exhibited distinct membrane properties, firing patterns, and axonal projections. We assessed serotonergic modulation using bath-applied 5-HT and subtype-specific receptor mechanisms. Key Results: 5-HT produced divergent postsynaptic responses across pyramidal neuron subtypes: ASH and RS neurons depolarised via 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) activation, whereas ASL neurons exhibited 5-HT1AR-mediated hyperpolarisation. Among interneurons, rFS and sFS cells depolarised through ionotropic 5-HT3ARs, while nFS interneurons were largely unaffected. At the synaptic level, 5-HT suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission between pyramidal neurons via presynaptic 5-HT1BRs, and conversely enhanced GABAergic transmission from FS interneurons via presynaptic 5-HT3ARs. Conclusions & Implications: Serotonin exerts bidirectional, cell type-specific serotonergic modulation of local microcircuits that acts to suppress excitation while facilitating inhibition. This balanced and targeted regulation, arising from distinct distributions of somatodendritic and presynaptic 5-HT receptors, provides a mechanistic basis for serotonergic influence on attention, cognitive flexibility, and emotional regulation.",

      "title": "Cues for odor naming affect performance and brain connectivity",
      "content": "Human olfactory perception and naming represent a complex example of multisensory integration, with growing interest in how cues from different modalities affect olfactory recognition and naming. While studies show that visual cues may support odor naming performance, little is known about how cueing and multisensory integration in odor naming tasks influence neural mechanisms. This study examined the cognitive mechanisms underlying odor identification and the effect of two visual cue types\u2014lexical and color\u2014using behavioral and EEG methods. It also investigated the impact of hedonic ratings, Tip of the Nose phenomenon, familiarity, and subjective recall experiences on odor naming. Forty participants took part in an odor identification task using Sniffin\u2019 Sticks. For each trial, an odorant was first presented, followed by either a visual cue (a color patch associated with the odor source) or a lexical cue (a word fragment). Participants were then asked to name the odor. To examine the neural mechanisms involved in cue-assisted odor identification, the time window during odor naming after the visual cue presentation was analyzed. Connectivity analysis and behavioral performance were assessed to evaluate the effectiveness of the different cue types in supporting identification. Behavioral findings showed that lexical cues improved identification accuracy. Furthermore, hedonic ratings, familiarity, and experiences related to the TON were found to significantly affect naming performance. Odor familiarity and liking levels affected both response accuracy and response time, with more familiar and liked odors being identified both more accurately and more quickly. Granger causality analysis revealed that the color cue condition exhibited more numerous and stronger network connections compared to the lexical cue condition. The lexical cue condition demonstrated more restricted network activation with fewer connections, utilizing focused frontal-temporal and frontal-parietal circuits. In both conditions, prefrontal regions served as strong control hubs, and language networks were preserved. However, additional frontal-occipital connections were observed in the color cue condition, in the form of interhemispheric coordination and visual system integration. The findings demonstrated that cross-modal odor naming utilizes different neural connections depending on cue type, with lexical cues showing more direct access to linguistic areas while color cues exhibit more complex connectivity patterns.",
