      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all! I just released a <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/\">new HTML5 parser</a> that I'm really proud of. Happy to get any feedback on how to improve it from the python community on Reddit.</p> <p>I think the trickiest thing is if there is a &quot;market&quot; for a python only parser. Parsers are generally performance sensitive, and python just isn't the faster language. This library does parse the wikipedia startpage in 0.1s, so I think it's &quot;fast enough&quot;, but still unsure.</p> <p>Anyways, I got HEAVY help from AI to write it. I directed it all carefully (which I hope shows), but GitHub Copilot wrote all the code. Still took months of work off-hours to get it working. Wrote down a short blog post about that if it's interesting to anyone: <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/\">https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/</a></p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>It takes a string of html, and parses it into a nested node structure. To make sure you are seeing exactly what a browser would be seeing, it follows the html5 parsing rules. These are VERY complicated, and have evolved over the years.</p> <pre><code>from justhtml import JustHTML html = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div id='main'&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; doc = JustHTML(html) # 1. Traverse the tree # The tree is made of SimpleDomNode objects. # Each node has .name, .attrs, .children, and .parent root = doc.root # #document html_node = root.children[0] # html body = html_node.children[1] # body (children[0] is head) div = body.children[0] # div print(f&quot;Tag: {div.name}&quot;) print(f&quot;Attributes: {div.attrs}&quot;) # 2. Query with CSS selectors # Find elements using familiar CSS selector syntax paragraphs = doc.query(&quot;p&quot;) # All &lt;p&gt; elements main_div = doc.query(&quot;#main&quot;)[0] # Element with id=&quot;main&quot; bold = doc.query(&quot;div &gt; p b&quot;) # &lt;b&gt; inside &lt;p&gt; inside &lt;div&gt; # 3. Pretty-print HTML # You can serialize any node back to HTML print(div.to_html()) # Output: # &lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt; # &lt;p&gt; # Hello, # &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt; # ! # &lt;/p&gt; # &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> (e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc.)</p> <p>This is meant for production use. It's fast. It has 100% test coverage. I have fuzzed it against 3 million seriously broken html strings. Happy to improve it further based on your feedback.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> (A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives.)</p> <p>I've added a comparison table here: <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/?tab=readme-ov-file#comparison-to-other-parsers\">https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/?tab=readme-ov-file#comparison-to-other-parsers</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Huvet\"> /u/Huvet </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdgpmk/justhtml_a_pure_python_html5_parser_that_just/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdgpmk/justhtml_a_pure_python_html5_parser_that_just/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Torsional Force by Helical Pericytes Regulates Blood Flow in Downstream Capillaries",
      "content": "This study investigates the contractile properties of downstream capillaries, which are traditionally regarded as passive conduits, and addresses ongoing debates surrounding blood flow regulation. It is widely accepted that these capillaries passively dilate in response to increased blood flow in upstream microvessels, and that the helical pericytes located on them lack contractile capability, largely due to the absence of detectable a-SMA expression. Challenging this prevailing view, we demonstrate that downstream capillary pericytes do express both a-SMA and Myosin11, as shown using in situ hybridization on whole-mount intact retinas -unlike prior studies that relied on dissociated cells. Furthermore, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis reveals that a-SMA and Myosin11 are in sufficiently close proximity to permit actomyosin bridge cycling, a process essential for contraction. We also show that pericyte contraction can be inhibited by disrupting this molecular interaction. Distinct from the nodal constrictions caused by circular pericyte processes in upstream microvessels, we identify torsional contractions in the downstream capillaries in the retina of living mice using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM), which regulates blood flow. These contractions provide direct evidence that downstream capillaries actively contribute to blood flow regulation. Notably, such contractions were overlooked in previous TPLSM studies that monitored only luminal diameter, unless the specialized analytical techniques we employed were applied. Our 3D modeling confirms that these torsional contractions correlate with the helical morphology of pericytes in downstream capillaries -a structure previously thought incapable of producing significant constrictive force. In conclusion, our findings provide direct evidence that downstream pericytes play an active role in regulating blood flow. They highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism -torsional contraction- that aligns with the helical structure of these pericytes and contributes to flow regulation in small-caliber capillaries located nearest to regions of high oxygen demand.",

      "title": "Early Diabetic Ca2+ Handling Impairments in the Rod Bipolar Pathway",
      "content": "Background: Previous work showed that electrically-evoked inhibition to Rod Bipolar Cells (RBC) is reduced in a mouse model of early diabetes. It is hypothesized that this is due to impaired Ca2+ handling in the presynaptic amacrine cell, either through increased Ca2+ buffering or decreased influx. To test this hypothesis and develop a mechanism for this effect, a model where direct optogenetic activation of inhibitory amacrine cells that expressed the light-activated channel ChR2 was used to isolate amacrine cell inputs to RBCs. Application of selective Ca2+ channel blockers could then assess potential locations of amacrine Ca2+ disruption. Using whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology, recordings were made from a 6 week diabetic population (DM) and vehicle injected non-DM animals. Results: Robust GABA C receptor inhibitory currents were recorded from RBCs after ChR2 stimulus that were significantly diminished by the application of nifedipine to block L-typeCa2+ channels in both DM and non-DM conditions. There were significant differences in the peak amplitude of these responses between DM and non- DM groups (p = 0.0146). However, in the non-DM group the decay tau of the response to the 50ms stimulus was significantly diminished by nifedipine ( p =0.0498, n = 5), but this was not seen in the DM group ( p = 0.9498, n=7). A 1s nifedipine-reduced response saw its decay tau increase in the DM group but not the non-DM. Ca2+ - induced Ca2+ release (CICR) blockade with ryanodine decreased responsivity equally between groups in the 1s stimulus but showed no significant kinetic changes. CICR blockade for a 50ms stimulus response showed significant kinetic changes in diabetes but otherwise reduced the response equally between DM and non-DM. Blockade of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) had little effect on the optogenetic response. Conclusion: This study presents evidence that diabetes alters amacrine cell output to the RBC unmasked through blockade of the L-type calcium channel, and the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). An apparent explanation for our results is that DM calcium buffering is dysregulated, leading to prolonged responses. The underlying mechanism for this alteration is complex and not yet clearly elucidated.",
