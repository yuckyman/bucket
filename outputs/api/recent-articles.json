      "title": "Intrabody-guided synapse proteomics defines pyramidal neuron input architecture and uncovers early remodeling in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Across their proximal and distal dendritic domains, pyramidal neurons (PNs) integrate inputs that differ in morphology and function. Hippocampal CA1 PNs are among the earliest affected neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the molecular composition of their inputs and selective vulnerability remain poorly defined. We develop an intrabody-guided proximity-labeling strategy that targets the biotin ligase TurboID to endogenous postsynaptic scaffolds for cell-autonomous mapping of postsynaptic proteomes. Targeting PSD95 or Homer1 enables selective labeling of excitatory postsynaptic proteins in mouse CA1 PNs and resolves subsynaptic organization by comparing the two probes. Mapping the proteomes of major CA1 inputs uncovers a proximal-distal molecular logic that underlies their distinct properties. Applying this approach in the AppNL-G-F AD mouse model reveals an early signaling-driven phase of synaptic remodeling followed by a later translation-linked phase, with persistent downregulation of glutamatergic components. These results provide a molecular atlas of CA1 PN inputs and identify stage-specific mechanisms of synaptic vulnerability in early AD.",

      "title": "Accurate evaluation of neural sensitivity to weak alternating electric fields requires protocols accounting for input dependence",
      "content": "Background: Weak alternating electric fields (~1 V/m) modulate nervous system activity. Yet, the exact mechanism by which such low amplitude electric fields can modulate neural activity is still unknown despite the use of specific protocols aiming at quantifying neural sensitivity. Objective: To characterize how the measurement protocol can impact neural sensitivity to weak electric fields and bias in vivo sensitivity. Methods: We considered a variety of somatic clamp stimulation to drive the activity of biophysical morpho-realistic reconstructed neurons during extracellular alternating stimulation to quantify the sensitivity to the field depending on the nature of cells' activity. Results: Cells sensitivity to alternating current stimulation depended on the type of input used to drive their activity, with a different frequency response for each protocol, with a trend for inhibitory neurons to be more sensitive to higher stimulation frequencies. Even with the same clamp protocol, sensitivity depended on the statistics of the input used. Significance: Neuronal sensitivity to alternating current stimulation is highly input-dependent, which has been largely neglected so far, and depends on the current statistic of the received inputs, and is not reliably represented by simple current clamps protocols.",

      "title": "Absence of Local Retinotopy in the Mouse Optic Tract",
      "content": "Retinotopy is a fundamental organizational principle of the visual system, where neighboring neurons represent adjacent points in visual space. This spatial relationship is established by precise anatomical wiring across successive areas, from the retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the visual cortex. To examine the precision of this topographic arrangement within the long-range projection axons themselves, we recorded retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the mouse optic tract (OT) and mapped their receptive fields (RFs). As expected for a retinotopically organized area, we found that nearby LGN cell pairs had significantly smaller RF distances than distant pairs. In contrast, no such relationship was observed among RGC axons in the OT. Modelling analyses further confirmed that the observed RF distances in the OT were incompatible with any locally retinotopic arrangement. Instead, the OT retained only coarse topography, with ~20 degrees RF deviations or ~45 m axonal displacements from an ideal retinotopic organization. These results demonstrate that the mouse OT lacks fine-scale retinotopy and maintains only broad topographic structure.",
