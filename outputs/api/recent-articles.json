      "title": "Astrocyte cell-surface proteomics identified CD44 as an OPN/SPP1 receptor regulating lipid metabolism and glial crosstalk in Alzheimer s disease",
      "content": "The development of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) pathology in Alzheimer s disease (AD) is accompanied by profound changes in astrocytes and microglia. How these responses are orchestrated by cell surface proteins, key mediators of cell-cell communication, remain unclear. Using in situ astrocyte cell-surface proteome profiling in 5xFAD mice, we identified a set of dysregulated surface proteins induced by A{beta} pathology, including CD44. CD44 was selectively upregulated in plaque-adjacent astrocytes and interacted with osteopontin (OPN), encoded by the diseaseassociated microglia gene Spp1, to promote lipid accumulation, and this effect is {gamma}-secretase dependent. Astrocytic CD44 in turn regulated Spp1 expression and microglial activity. Conditional deletion of Cd44 in adult astrocytes of 5xFAD mice attenuated glial reactivity, reduced A{beta} pathology, and improved cognition. These findings define a plaque-proximal OPN-CD44 axis that controls astrocyte lipid metabolism and glial activity, positioning CD44 as a surface-accessible therapeutic target in AD.",

      "title": "Early intervention with a PACAP lactoside following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury prevents persistent LHb hyperactivity and motivational deficits in male mice",
      "content": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often leads to long-lasting mood disorders and motivational deficits, significantly decreasing quality of life. The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has known neuroprotective effects and is often deficient in neurological conditions, but its role in preventing mTBI's long-term effects on mood circuits remains unclear. Our previous studies of repetitive closed-head mTBI in murine models found that the lateral habenula (LHb) is a key area for post-injury impairments. These impairments are characterized by mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and mood-related behavioral deficits. Here we investigated if a novel PACAP type I receptor (PAC1R) agonist, TES2320, could prevent or treat these long-term mTBI effects. The drug is based on a truncated glycoside analogue of PACAP that is stable and brain penetrant. Using RNAscope, we first found that mTBI caused a persistent and widespread reduction in PACAP mRNA within the LHb, suggesting a possible mTBI-related PACAP signaling deficiency in LHb circuits. We then used two intervention strategies in young adult male mice: an early intervention administered immediately after injury and a late intervention given as a single injection one-month post-injury. One month after injury, we measured LHb activity and self-care grooming motivation. Both early and late PAC1 agonist interventions almost completely normalized the mTBI-induced increases in LHb spontaneous tonic activity and hyperexcitability. However, only the early intervention improved the delayed initiation of grooming seen in mTBI mice. Unfortunately, a single late PAC1R agonist injection not only failed to reverse the grooming delay, but also significantly reduced total grooming behavior 24 hours after treatment. This finding points to a potential behavioral side effect of late PAC1R agonist administration on grooming. Overall, our findings confirm that an early PAC1R agonist intervention effectively prevents mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and associated motivational deficits, likely by restoring the persistent PACAP signaling deficiency in the LHb and its related circuits. This preclinical study provides strong evidence that novel PAC1R agonists could be a valuable preventive therapy for mTBI-related depression and anti-reward circuit dysfunction.",

      "title": "Tether-mediated extraction of myelinoid bodies by microglia and astrocytes can maintain myelin integrity",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes make myelin for the electrical insulation of axons and saltatory impulse conduction. Myelin lipids and proteins undergo a slow turnover, but exactly how the multilamellar and compacted membrane sheaths are remodeled without compromising myelin sheath integrity has remained puzzling, in particular at advanced age when myelin abnormalities increase. Earlier EM studies had suggested myelin membranes are shed and subsequently phagocytosed by microglia. However, the formation of multilamellar myelinoid bodies (MBs), leaving a well-ordered myelin sheath behind, is difficult to reconcile with simple shedding mechanisms. Here, we show by three-dimensional FIB-SEM reconstructions of optic nerves in mice and by two-photon live-imaging of myelinated cortical slices that MBs are initially connected to their parental sheaths by long tethers, which are stretched by trogocytosing microglia and astrocytes. We observe ruptured tethers attached to both MBs and sheaths, suggesting a novel mechanism of tension-driven tether scission. Importantly, the successive fusion of the corresponding innermost myelin membranes in an extended tether can preserve myelin sheath integrity. Thus, the remodeling by tether-mediated MB extraction emerges as a mechanism of physiological maintenance of myelin sheaths in the CNS.",

      "title": "Loss of neurexins disrupts inhibitory connectivity and increases vulnerability of dopamine neurons in culture",
      "content": "Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are essential regulators of basal ganglia function. Their axonal structure is intricate, with numerous non-synaptic release sites and fewer synaptic terminals that notably release glutamate or GABA. Despite their significance, the molecular mechanisms governing DA neuron connectivity and neurochemical identity remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules such as neurexins (Nrxns) regulate the interactions of DA neuron axons with target cells and thereby influence axonal branching and synapse formation by DA neurons. We therefore examined neuronal survival, axonal growth and synapse formation in cultured DA neurons lacking all neurexins (DAT::NrxnsKO). Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons revealed that loss of Nrxns does not disrupt the basic development of these neurons or the structure of their axonal terminals, including normal expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, loss of Nrxns affects the survival of DA neurons and their formation of inhibitory synapses, suggesting that Nrxns regulate the axonal connectivity of these neurons.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "title": "Electroconvulsive Therapy Induces Dopaminergic Axon Regeneration, Corticostriatal Remodeling, and Restoration of Motor Function in Parkinsonian Mice",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons with loss of axonal dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum, leading to striatal circuit dysfunction and debilitating motor symptoms. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief but do not restore lost neuronal function. Decades of clinical observations have reported the unexpected observation that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a standard treatment for refractory neuropsychiatric disorders, can incidentally alleviate motor symptoms in PD patients, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD, two weeks of repeated ECT produced robust and sustained motor recovery, with improvements in locomotion and sensorimotor asymmetry persisting for at least 30 days post-treatment. Remarkably, ECT induced dopaminergic axonal sprouting from surviving dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies located at the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental border, leading to a partial recovery of striatal dopaminergic axonal reinnervation. In striatal direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), which exhibit pathological hyperexcitability and spine loss following dopamine depletion, ECT normalized both corticostriatal synaptic responses and spine density. Consistently, ECT upregulated gene transcripts involved in cytoskeletal remodeling while downregulating those associated with glutamatergic signaling and neuronal excitability. These changes were accompanied by a coordinated transcriptional shift toward enhanced mitochondrial anabolic capacity and energy production, including increased expression of genes involved in ATP and Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that ECT can partially restore basal ganglia circuitry following dopamine depletion and provide a basis for further study of its potential as a noninvasive, disease-modifying intervention for PD.",

      "content": "Intracellular re-distribution of the neuronal microtubule associated protein Tau, from the axon into the somatodendritic compartment, is a physiological stress-related event that increases Tau in the soma and enables Tau interactions with the nucleus. Cellular functions of stress-induced Tau-Nucleus interactions are unknown. Combining proximity biotinylation interactomics with chromatin imaging and molecular reconstitution assays, we uncover that physiological Tau interacts with proteins coordinating chromatin at the nuclear membrane, including lamin B receptor, thereby changing their DNA interactions. Accordingly, we find that increasing somatodendritic Tau is sufficient to dysregulate expression of genes in lamin associated domains and transcription factors, collectively leading to an upregulation of stress response pathways and downregulation of cholesterol metabolic genes. These nuclear envelope-related mechanisms suggest that neuronal stress-related somatodendritic Tau missorting can initiate chromatin-related cascades important for early changes in AD and tauopathies.",

      "title": "Anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus",
      "content": "The medial thalamus (MTh) is a critical hub for integrating the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet its cellular and circuit organization remains poorly defined. Here, we combine activity-dependent genetic tagging, whole-brain clearing and light-sheet imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and viral circuit tracing to build a comprehensive anatomical and molecular atlas of nociceptive and opioidergic neurons within the MTh. We show that acute and chronic pain activate distinct, spatially localized microdomains across multiple MTh subnuclei, including the central medial, interanteromedial, mediodorsal, and xiphoid nuclei. Activity-dependent tagging reveals a stable ensemble of nociceptive neurons that remains engaged across acute and chronic pain states, suggesting persistent thalamic encoding of affective nociception. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we find that most nociceptive-activated neurons express Oprm1, and that nearly all Oprm1 neurons are activated by nociceptive stimuli, identifying a pain-active, -opioid receptor-expressing population in MTh (MThMOR). Rabies-based tracing demonstrates that MThMOR neurons receive convergent inputs from nociceptive and inhibitory regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and habenula, while projecting broadly to cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures involved in pain, arousal, and motivation. Enkephalinergic inputs to MTh arise from distinct, non-nociceptive populations, suggesting parallel pathways for nociceptive transmission and endogenous opioid modulation. Together, these findings define the anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus and highlight MThMOR neurons as a cell-type-specific substrate for the development of targeted opioid-based pain therapies.",

      "title": "Phospho-signalling deregulation of the mTOR pathway in fibroblasts from LRRK2 Parkinson s patients",
      "content": "Activating mutations at the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent genetic cause of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Using in-depth mass-spectrometry, here we analysed the impact of LRRK2 mutations on the proteome and phospho-proteome of skin fibroblasts from a large LRRK2 clinical cohort from Spain. The cohort encompassed G2019S LRRK2-associated PD (L2PD) (n=15), G2019S LRRK2 non-manifesting carriers (L2NMCs) (n=13), idiopathic PD (iPD) (n=12), and control subjects (n=14) (total n=54). The proteome analysis revealed 89 differential proteins in G2019S L2PD (58 down/ 31 up) and 168 in G2019S L2NMCs (127 down / 41 up) compared to controls. Most of these proteome changes involved deficits in proteins related to mitochondrial energy and ribosomal protein synthesis. At the phospho-proteome level, we identified 394 differential phospho-sites in G2019S L2PD (188 hyper / 206 hypo), 367 in G2019S L2NMCs (215 hyper / 152 hypo), and 428 in iPD (214 hyper / 214 hypo) compared with controls. These phospho-proteomic changes included hyper-phosphorylated proteins associated with the mTOR and Rho GTPase pathways. Notably, the top hyper-phosphorylated hit in G2019S carriers was pThr37/46 4E-BP1, a key effector of the mTOR pathway controlling protein synthesis, and this protein was also deregulated in iPD. In summary, our study uncovers peripheral deregulation of mTOR phospho-signalling associated with LRRK2 mutations, which is related to deficits in mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins, and affects converging pathways altered in iPD.",

      "title": "Encoding and Decoding of Brain Dynamic Functional Connectivity for ADHD Diagnosis",
      "content": "Recent studies have demonstrated strong associations between the changes in dynamic functional connectivity (FC) and both behavioral and cognitive functions. The sliding window technique is the most widely used method for evaluating dynamic FC; however, it faces two key challenges: distributional shifts across windows and high dimensionality, as FC is computed across windows of the entire time series. To address these issues, we propose BRAINMAP (Bi-level Representation using Attention for INterpretability with Mamba-Aided Prediction) to model the dynamic FC of the brain. BRAINMAP employs the Optimal Transport technique to correct distributional shifts across sliding windows and leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a hybrid approach that integrates an attention mechanism and the Mamba block to effectively capture spatiotemporal features for functional MR images. Finally, we introduce a novel Top-K sliding window feature selection algorithm to induce sparsity in dynamic FC. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our model for diagnosing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using three resting-state fMRI datasets: ADHD-200, UCLA, and CNI-TLC, which comprise a total of 447 subjects with ADHD and 845 typically developing controls. Our architecture outperformed existing state-of-the-art dynamic FC models in ADHD detection, achieving improvements ranging from 3% to 12% across the three datasets. We demonstrate that our proposed model produces robust biomarkers, most notably the connection between the dorsal attention network and the visual network. Using an association study, we further establish the clinical relevance of the identified biomarkers.",

      "title": "Metabolic modelling and time-resolved mapping of glucose oxidative metabolism in rats brain by indirect deuterium detection with 1H-FID-MRSI at 9.4T",
      "content": "Object: The present study exploits newly developed dynamic indirect 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI at 9.4T, combined with a dedicated metabolic model, to enable regional and quantitative characterization of glucose oxidative metabolism flux in the rat brain with minimal metabolic assumptions, by measuring both 2H-labelled Glx turnover and pool size along a controlled 2H-Glc infusion protocol. Materials and Methods: Seven rats underwent dynamic 2D 1H-FID-MRSI during a 2-hour infusion of [6,6'-2H2] glucose. Consecutive 13-min acquisitions quantified Glx-C4 1H-signal decay, converted to 2H-Glx concentrations using baseline metabolite pool sizes. A three-pool kinetic model including 2H-label loss was fitted to regional turnover curves to estimate oxidative flux (Vgt) and pyruvate dilution (Kdil). Model performance and parameter robustness were finally assessed with Monte-Carlo simulations. Results: In vivo 2H-Glx turnover showed a saturated exponential rise (~60 min), with a labelling plateau higher in striatum (1.85 mol/g) than hippocampus (1.55 mol/g). Metabolic modelling provided region-specific oxidative fluxes: Vgt = 0.27 {+/-} 0.07 mol/g/min (hippocampus) and Vgt = 0.40 {+/-} 0.06 mol/g/min (striatum), with consistent Kdil across regions. Simulations confirmed a good model robustness in retrieving Vgt over a large range of experimental conditions. Discussion: This work shows the appropriateness of indirect dynamic 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI for quantitative metabolic flux mapping of cerebral glucose oxidative metabolism.

      "title": "Towards harmonized spectral quantification in MRSI: Comparative analysis of Backward-Linear-Predicted and original 1H-FID-MRSI dephased data",
      "content": "Object: We hypothesized that the inherent acquisition delay (AD) in 1H-FID-MRSI can introduce systematic LCModel quantification biases due to strong spectral dephasing, and that Backward-Linear-Prediction (BLP) reconstruction toward AD = 0 ms can harmonize metabolite estimates across acquisitions with various delays. Materials and Methods: 2D 1H-FID-MRSI were acquired in rats at 14.1T with three AD values (0.71, 0.94, 1.30 ms). Hippocampal metabolites were quantified using LCModel and AD-matched basis sets. Complementary Monte-Carlo simulations (n = 1000) replicated 1H-FID-MRSI spectra at multiple ADs under realistic SNR conditions. BLP was applied to in vivo and simulated FIDs to back-predict missing points up to AD = 0 ms, enabling quantification within a unified basis set framework. Results: In vivo and simulated data showed clear AD-dependent variations for several metabolites (Gln, tCho, tNAA, Ins, Tau), with discrepancies frequently >10% despite AD-specific basis sets. Simulations confirmed metabolite-specific biases increasing with AD. BLP reconstruction preserved quantification consistency up to 0.98 ms of recovered FIDs, reducing inter-AD mismatches in vivo - particularly for Tau, tNAA and tCho - lowering the mean discrepancy from 10.5% to approx. 5%. Discussion: These findings show that AD affects 1H-FID-MRSI quantification in LCModel, whereas BLP reconstruction can harmonize spectra across delays by enabling a virtual AD = 0 ms quantification scheme. This supports BLP as a practical strategy to improve consistency and comparability in MRSI studies.
