      "title": "Neuro-metabolic pathways of high-protein meal reducing food craving",
      "content": "Across species, high-protein foods have been shown to reduce appetite throughout the day. Although higher protein intake alters multiple metabolic responses, the exact neuro-metabolic mechanisms underlying food craving remain unclear. Here, we investigated whether a protein-rich diet modulates plasma tyrosine dynamics, the precursor of dopamine, thereby altering dopaminergic brain activity and reducing food craving in humans. In this within-subject, cross-over study, 30 healthy participants (age, Mean=23.63, SD=3.23 years) were provided with either a high- or low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast. Three and a half hours after breakfast, participants viewed high-or low caloric food images while undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and their subjective food craving was assessed using the validated Food Craving Questionnaire- State version. Through the experimental procedure, plasma tyrosine levels were continuously monitored. Our results show that the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast significantly enhanced plasma tyrosine levels, which were negatively associated with subjective food craving several hours after meal intake. Importantly, we observed significantly stronger midbrain activity following the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, which was associated with greater reduction in subjective food craving. Furthermore, we analyzed brain gradients that characterize spatial patterns of large-scale neural activity, allowing us to examine the entire process underlying dietary choices at the whole-brain level. Compared with the low-protein/carbohydrate breakfast, the high-protein/carbohydrate breakfast reduced whole-brain functional reorganization, indicating lower neural sensitivity to high- versus low-caloric food stimuli. Notably, the degree of this high-protein/carbohydrate induced brain-state shift was related to the reduction in food craving. Together, these results provide strong evidence that high-protein/carbohydrate meals modulate dopaminergic mechanisms and large-scale whole-brain neural reorganization, contributing to reduced food craving throughout the day in humans.",

I started with Python ( thanks google gemini lol) and so far it took me through python 3, fastapi and jinja2. Before I start to deep dive and spend more time learning these I was wondering if this is the right tech stack. It appears the JS, React and Node JS are more popular?

      "title": "Molecular signatures of maladaptive plasticity in the amygdala in a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain",
      "content": "Chronic pain, a complex multidimensional disorder, remains a major health care issue and a therapeutic challenge. Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain condition that results from damage or dysfunction in the nervous system. While mechanisms of neuropathic pain at the peripheral and spinal cord level have been extensively studied, pain mechanisms in the brain remain underexplored. The amygdala, a limbic brain region, has emerged as a critical brain area for the emotional-affective dimension of pain and pain modulation. Amygdala neuroplasticity has been associated with pain states, but exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these states and the transition from acute to chronic pain are not well understood. Here, we used the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain in male rats to investigate changes in gene expression in the amygdala at the chronic pain stage using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Two amygdala nuclei, basolateral (BLA) and central (CeA), were investigated in a hemisphere-dependent manner. We used an integrative approach that focuses on functional significance and cell type specificity of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to nominate mechanistic targets for central regulation of chronic pain. Our integrative transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses identified individual genes (e.g., Cxcl10, Cxcl12, Mbp, Plp1, Mag, Mog, Slc17a6, Gad1, Sst), molecular pathways (e.g., cytokine-mediated signaling pathway), biological processes (e.g., myelination, synaptic transmission), and specific cell types (e.g., oligodendrocytes, glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurons) affected by chronic pain. Our results also provide evidence for the emerging concept of hemispheric lateralization of pain processing in the amygdala. Overall, our study proposes oligodendrocyte dysfunction in the amygdala, neuroimmune signaling in CeA, and glutamatergic neurotransmission in BLA as mechanistic determinants of and potential therapeutic targets for the management of chronic neuropathic pain.",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, we're Deniz and Sherry from Tamarind Bio (<a href=\"https://www.tamarind.bio\">https://www.tamarind.bio</a>). Tamarind is an inference provider for AI drug discovery, serving models like AlphaFold. Biopharma companies use our library of leading open-source models to design new medicines computationally.<p>Here\u2019s a demo: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/luoMApPeglo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/luoMApPeglo</a><p>Two years ago, I was hired at a Stanford lab to run models for my labmates. Some post-doc would ask me to run a set of 1-5 models in sequence with tens of thousands inputs and I would email them back the result after setting up the workflow in the university cluster.<p>At some point, it became unreasonable that all of an organization's computational biology work would go through an undergrad, so we built Tamarind as a single place for all molecular AI tools, usable at massive scale with no technical background needed. Today, we are used by much of the top 20 pharma, dozens of biotechs and tens of thousands of scientists.<p>When we started getting adoption in the big pharma companies, we found that this problem also persisted. I know directors of data science, where half their job could be described as running scripts for other people.<p>Lots of companies have also deprecated their internally built solution to switch over, dealing with GPU infra and onboarding docker containers not being a very exciting problem when the company you work for is trying to cure cancer.<p>Unlike non-specialized inference providers, we build both a programmatic interface for developers along with a scientist-friendly web app, since most of our users are non-technical. Some of them used to extract proteins from animal blood before replacing that process with using AI to generate proteins on Tamarind.<p>Besides grinding out images for each of the models we serve, we\u2019ve designed a standardized schema to be able to share each model\u2019s data format. We\u2019ve built a custom scheduler and queue optimized for horizontal scaling (each inference call takes minutes to hours, and runs on one GPU at a time), while splitting jobs across CPUs and GPUs for optimal timing.<p>As we've grown to handle a substantial portion of the biopharma R&amp;D AI demand on behalf of our customers, we've expanded beyond just offering a library of open source protocols.<p>A common use case we saw from early on was the need to connect multiple models together into pipelines, and having reproducible, consistent protocols to replace physical experiments. Once we became the place to build internal tools for computational science, our users started asking if they could onboard their own models to the platform.<p>From there, we now support fine-tuning, building UIs for arbitrary docker containers, connecting to wet lab data sources and more!<p>Reach out to me at deniz[at]tamarind.bio if you\u2019re interested in our work, we are hiring!

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",
