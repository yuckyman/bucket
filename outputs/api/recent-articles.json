      "title": "Pupil size reveals the perceptual quality and effortless nature of synesthesia",
      "content": "Synesthesia describes cross-modal processes that can generate 'extra' conscious percepts, such as seeing additional color when reading numbers. While existing research focuses on the mechanisms and effects of synesthetic associations, it often overlooks its most distinctive feature: unique sensory phenomenology. Here, we introduce pupillometry as an objective physiological measure of synesthetic color phenomenology. Across 16 grapheme-color synesthetes and two matched control groups, pupil responses tracked the brightness of synesthetic colors under constant physical visual input, scaling with self-reported strength. Synesthetic colors elicited pupil dynamics comparable to real colors, dissociating synesthetes from non-synesthetes. These responses emerged too rapidly to reflect imagery and scaled with reported color brightness, revealing cross-modally caused genuine perceptual processing. Controls required to generate color associations showed greater effort-linked pupil dilation than synesthetes or controls who did not report colors, providing evidence for the effortless nature of synesthesia. Synesthesia thus provides an extraordinarily tractable human model for studying physiologically measurable phenomenology.",

      "title": "A Mesoscale Framework for Psychedelic Drug Action in the Human Brain",
      "content": "The mechanism of psychedelic drug action is a dynamic area of neuroscience, with two major lines of investigation: (1) laboratory studies at the molecular and cellular level, and (2) human neuroimaging studies of functional brain networks. Despite considerable progress, there remains insufficient understanding of the link between molecular/cellular substrates of psychedelics and the whole-brain network effects that result. Here we report a study of psychedelic action that focuses on the intermediate spatial scale of local brain regions (<1cm3). We analyzed the effects of classical psychedelics (dimethyltryptamine [DMT], lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], psilocybin) and non-classical psychedelics (nitrous oxide, ketamine) in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that all five drugs reduced regional homogeneity, that is, they disrupted local synchrony, in small-scale brain regions; this disruption occurred extensively in cortical regions and sparsely in subcortical regions. Dynamic analysis of both regional homogeneity and global functional connectivity showed an inverse pattern, with large-scale functional connectivity being enhanced as local synchrony declined. We then conducted dominance analysis to assess the contribution of various neurotransmitter receptors to changes in regional homogeneity. DMT, LSD, and psilocybin showed the 5-HT receptors as the most dominant association; by contrast, regional homogeneity changes attributable to both nitrous oxide and ketamine were most strongly associated with the NMDA receptor. Both neuronal (including interneurons) and non-neuronal cell types were linked to psychedelic-induced changes in synchrony at the level of local brain regions. These data, across five drugs from two drug classes, provide evidence that a diverse set of molecular and cellular events lead to a common outcome of disrupted synchrony in local brain regions, which in turn mediate drug-specific changes in global functional connectivity.",

      "content": "Social animals are faced with a critical decision when sick: to affiliate or withdraw. The behavioural response during an immune challenge varies by individual and species. However, the social and biological factors leading to variation in this decision during an immune challenge are unknown. Here, we explore the affiliative behavioural phenotype, \"huddlers\" and \"non-huddlers,\" as a social predictor, and microglial activation and peripheral cytokine expression as biological predictors of social-decision making during an immune challenge. To measure social-decision making, we recorded social approach and time spent in proximity to a familiar same-sex conspecific versus a novel object in the social California mouse following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. Behavioural phenotype predicted both the social response to LPS and the relationship between cytokine activity and social behaviour, suggesting that social experience regulates social decision-making during sick versus healthy conditions. Additionally, we found that elevated microglia activity in the dentate gyrus (DG) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) negatively correlated with social behaviour, positioning these regions for future exploration for the role of microglia on social decision-making. Our results identify the predictive power of behavioural phenotypes on social response to sickness and a link between microglia and decision-making during sickness.",

      "title": "Ventral Tegmental Area Glutamatergic Neurons Suppress Hippocampal Sharp-wave Ripples and Induce Head Movements in Mice",
      "content": "Sharp-wave ripples are brief, high-frequency hippocampal oscillations crucial for memory consolidation, occurring predominantly during the non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep. While ripples are generated intrinsically within the hippocampus, growing evidence suggests that their occurrence is modulated by subcortical regions. Whether the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a subcortical region that directly projects to the hippocampus, regulates ripple activity remains unknown. To investigate this, we optogenetically activated VTA neurons during NREM sleep and recorded ripple activity in the dorsal hippocampus via field recording electrodes. Using cell-type specific excitatory opsin expression in the VTA, we found that activation of glutamatergic (vGlut2+) neurons strongly suppressed ripple incidence. In contrast, activation of GABAergic (vGAT+) neurons produced weak suppression, and activation of dopaminergic (DAT+) neurons showed no effect. During ripple suppression by glutamatergic activation, we observed small but consistent head movements. Trial-by-trial analysis revealed no correlation between head movement and ripple suppression. Furthermore, glutamatergic activation during wakefulness also led to head movement, suggesting that ripple suppression and head movement could be dissociated. Overall, our results suggest that VTA vGlut2+ neurons play a role in head movement and that their activation suppresses hippocampal sharp-wave ripples during NREM sleep, offering a potential way to alter memory consolidation.",

      "title": "A dividing cell model for stable propagation and curing of bona fide human sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease prions",
      "content": "Prions are assemblies of misfolded proteins that cause transmissible, progressive neurodegenerative disease in humans and other mammals. Human prion diseases have particular public health and biological significance, both due to their transmissibility between hosts, and the mechanisms they share with many other neurodegenerative conditions. However, their study has been considerably impeded by the absence of a cell-based system capable of reproducibly propagating and quantifying bona fide human prion infectivity, which has been a goal for several decades. Here, we describe the first robust, cell-based assay of human prion infectivity in dividing cells. We found that CAD5 cells expressing human prion protein instead of the endogenous mouse prion protein, replicate human prion infectivity from brain samples of patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) expressing valine at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. Moreover, these cells quantify human prion infectivity with similar sensitivity to the current gold standard animal bioassay, at a fraction of the cost and time, maintain persistent infection that can be cured with an anti-prion treatment, and can be adapted for therapeutic screening. This novel system permits direct cell-based quantification and investigation of human prion infectivity for the first time.",
