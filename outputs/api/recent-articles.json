      "title": "Late-onset severe neutropenia in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis treated with ocrelizumab: case report and literature review",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo describe two cases of recurrent, delayed-onset severe neutropenia several months following ocrelizumab therapy in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).BackgroundA rare adverse effect of ocrelizumab is neutropenia, with late-onset neutropenia (LON) occurring more rarely. Literature guiding management of transient recurrent neutropenia in the setting of anti-CD20 therapy is lacking.MethodsCase 1: 38-year-old female emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Two years later, she developed severe symptomatic LON and required antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Ocrelizumab was held, patient switched to ozanimod, but neutropenia recurred. Due to concerns of MS progression, ocrelizumab was restarted after the patient transitioned to a telehealth setting, with no recurrence of neutropenia at one-year follow-up. Case 2: 35-year-old male emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab was resumed after absolute neutrophil count recovery. Two years later, he developed moderate symptomatic LON during a suspected viral illness. Ocrevus was discontinued at this point. A subsequent episode occurred 3\u202fmonths later during confirmed rhinovirus infection, again resolving promptly.ConclusionThese cases highlight the unpredictable nature of recurrent LON with ocrelizumab and suggest the possibility of immune-mediated marrow suppression, potentially unmasked or worsened by infections, rather than direct drug toxicity, highlighting the need for clearer management guidelines.",

      "title": "Reversible splenial lesion syndrome associated with Graves\u2019 disease and hepatic dysfunction: a case report",
      "content": "BackgroundReversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) has been confirmed to induce severe psychiatric symptoms. This syndrome is a rare clinical condition with an etiology that remains unclear. According to current literature, the primary cause of RESLES may be associated with cytotoxic cerebral edema. First reported in 1999, reversible splenial syndrome may be triggered by bacterial or viral infections, epileptic seizures, metabolic disorders, hyperosmolar cerebral edema, and other factors. In this study, we report the case of RESLES in a patient with Graves\u2019 disease and liver dysfunction.Case presentationThe patient was a 17-year-old female adolescent with persistent headaches, dizziness, and nausea with vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested RESLES as the diagnosis. On admission, the patient presented with elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and positive thyroid-receptor antibodies (TRAb), meeting the diagnostic criteria for Graves\u2019 disease. Concurrently, the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also elevated. After hormone therapy, the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved, and imaging results returned to normal.ConclusionThis study presents a case of a patient with RESLES characterized by Graves\u2019 disease and liver function abnormalities, who was sensitive to anti-thyroid drug (methimazole) and hormone therapy (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) and had a favorable prognosis. This study contributed to expanding the clinical understanding of RESLES and suggests that, in clinical practice, autoimmune hyperthyroidism may be a novel trigger for RESLES, while concurrent liver dysfunction in this context requires further investigation.",

      "title": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis drives stroke-associated pneumonia: mechanisms and targeted therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a central regulator of immune function, with growing research highlighting its association with the development of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). This review provides an overview of current research on the correlation between SAP and alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolism, with a focus on microbial imbalance, changes in key metabolites, and relevant biological mechanisms. Clinical and preclinical studies consistently report a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, an increase in potentially harmful microbial species, reduced SCFAs levels, and elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. These disturbances appear to be associated with SAP progression through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain and microbiota\u2013gut\u2013lung axes by affecting immune regulation and inflammatory responses. The review also examines microbiota-targeted treatment approaches, including dietary modification, antibiotic therapy, probiotics, microbiota-regulating compounds, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and respiratory microbiota transfer. A deeper understanding of how microbial disturbances are correlated with SAP may help explain the increased vulnerability to pulmonary infections following stroke and support the design of more effective, microbiota-based therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Single-channel EEG-based sleep stage classification via hybrid data distillation",
      "content": "Objective. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, more and more researchers have begun developing end-to-end automatic sleep stage classification frameworks. However, these frameworks typically require access to large electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets for training, which imposes a significant computational burden. Furthermore, EEG data contains patient privacy information, and using such data for training raises concerns about privacy infringement. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid data distillation method. We aim to enable single-channel EEG sleep stage classification with less training cost and privacy risk by distilling large real datasets into a tiny, privacy-preserving synthetic set for training from scratch. Approach. We first apply the gradient matching method to optimize the randomly initialized synthetic dataset. The gradient changes in the early stages of model training can quickly reduce the performance gap between the synthetic dataset and the source dataset. Subsequently, to avoid oscillations near the optimal solution during gradient matching, we switch to distribution matching to further optimize the synthetic dataset. This method aligns the data distribution at a global level, enhancing overall consistency. In addition, we adopt a novel mini-batch iteration method to assist the synthetic dataset in learning temporal dependencies. Main results. We validated our framework on three public datasets and achieved robust results. Significance. This study proposes an efficient and robust hybrid data distillation algorithm, providing a feasible approach for implementing sleep stage staging based on privacy protection.",

      "content": "Objective. As an emerging paradigm of brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs), speech BCI has the potential to directly reflect auditory perception and thoughts, offering a promising communication alternative for patients with aphasia. Chinese is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, whereas there is very limited research on speech BCIs for Chinese language. Approach. This paper reports a text-magnetoencephalography (MEG) dataset for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs. It also proposes a multi-modality assisted speech decoding (MASD) algorithm to capture both text and acoustic information embedded in brain signals during speech activities. Main results. Experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of both our text-MEG dataset and our proposed MASD algorithm. Significance. To our knowledge, this is the first study on multi-modality assisted decoding for non-invasive Chinese speech BCIs.",

      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "title": "Software and pipelines for registration and analyses of rodent brain image data in reference atlas space",
      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",
