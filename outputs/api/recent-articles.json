      "title": "Lateralized foraging induces asymmetric corticostriatal plasticity in mice",
      "content": "With practice, animals perform reward-oriented actions faster and with less variability. The dorsal striatum (DS) plays a key role in this process, potentially through opposing changes in cortical input strength to the two main striatal projection neurons (D1- and D2-SPNs). To test this hypothesis, we trained mice in a foraging task requiring them to perform quarter-turns (QTs) in a single direction (counterclockwise, CCW) along the walls of square towers to collect drops of water. As training progressed, the number and speed of CCW QTs increased while the variability of their trajectory decreased. Whisker trimming in well-trained mice altered QTs kinematics, highlighting the role of tactile inputs in guiding these actions. Combining ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DS with glutamate uncaging in the barrel cortex, we mapped the cortical neurons monosynaptically connected to D1- or D2-SPNs and measured the strength of these connections in the contralateral hemispheres, relative to the turn direction. In well-trained mice, compared to naive controls, the contralateral hemisphere showed no major changes in D1- or D2-SPNs connectivity, despite increased excitation of cortical pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the ipsiversive hemisphere exhibited no change in cortical excitability but showed increased cortical connectivity and input strength to SPNs. These findings reveal an unexpected hemispheric asymmetry in corticostriatal connectivity during lateralized foraging, which may reflect a homeostatic process normalizing striatal activity across hemispheres despite unbalanced cortical input.",

      "title": "Real-time Bayesian optimization of deep brain stimulation for personalized cognitive control enhancement",
      "content": "Background: Identifying effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters for psychiatric disorders has historically been a time-consuming and error prone process due to a lack of an objective and rapid readout of target circuit engagement. Cognitive control may have use as a biomarker of treatment efficacy but it has yet to be shown that DBS parameters can be reliably optimized to produce cognitive control improvements in individual subjects. Objective: We sought to leverage a rat model of DBS-driven cognitive control improvements to determine whether state of the art optimization algorithms could consistently identify effective stimulation amplitudes to enhance cognition. Methods: We delivered periods of active and inactive DBS-like stimulation at variable parameters while rats performed a Set-Shifting task that we previously showed to be stimulation-sensitive. We tested both predefined settings of interest and settings that were personalized to individual animals using Bayesian Optimization. Measurements of task performance including reaction time and accuracy were compared between acute, optimized, and traditional settings to evaluate effects on cognitive control. Results: Acute stimulation reduced reaction times without hindering accuracy (N=15), replicating the effects previously observed with chronic stimulation. In a second cohort (N=6), optimization of stimulation amplitude successfully reduced reaction times in all animals with comparable effect size to historically best settings. Conclusion: These findings confirm that optimization techniques can be effective for improving symptomatically-relevant cognitive markers supporting the feasibility of personalized, quantitatively-informed approaches to neuromodulation and target engagement for psychiatric and/or cognitive disorders.",

      "title": "Inducible CreERT2 mouse lines for characterization of retinal bipolar cell subtypes",
      "content": "Bipolar cells relay visual signals from photoreceptor cells to ganglion cells in the retina. Fifteen bipolar cell subtypes have been identified in the mouse retina. These subtypes are classified as ON and OFF bipolar cells based on their response to light stimulus or rod and cone bipolar cells based on their connection to photoreceptor cells. However, the unique structural and functional role of these subtypes in the processing of visual information is not fully known due to the inadequate tools and models available for their characterization. In this study, to trace the lineage and characterize Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4-expressing bipolar cell subtypes in developing and adult mouse retina, we developed inducible Cre lines under the promoter of Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 and crossed them with ChR2EYFP reporter mice. Lineages of cells expressing Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 after Cre induction in the adult and postnatal mouse retina were then characterized. ChR2EYFP expression driven by Vsx1-CreERT2 was detected in type 2, 6, and 7 bipolar cells, Lhx3-CreERT2 in type 1b, 2, and 6 bipolar cells, and Lhx4-CreERT2 in type 2, 3, 4, and 5 bipolar cells as well as cone photoreceptor cells in the adult mouse retina. These bipolar cell subtype-specific inducible Cre mouse lines serve as efficient tools for elucidation of the mechanisms that control bipolar cell subtype development and function in the retina.",

My girlfriend wanted to upload her own pictures to that hub. Tired of having to do it for her, and with her being unwilling to learn terminal commands, I developed <strong>OrbitCopy</strong>. It uses NiceGUI because I was tired of Qt and Tkinter, and I had already used it in another project of mine, so I grew quite fond of it.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>OrbitCopy uses SSH to provide a GUI-based way of copying files and directories. It visualizes the directory structure of both systems side by side and works asynchronously to ensure there are no random freezes. It can store your credentials behind a secure PIN. The credentials are encrypted and, after three failed login attempts, are wiped entirely.</p> <p><strong>Comparison With Other Solutions</strong></p> <p>I did not really look for other solutions. This was more of a learning experience for me, and I found developing it quite relaxing.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Anyone who hates the terminal and/or just wants a visual representation of the directory structure of the target system.</p> <p>If you find bugs or want to expand the tool, feel free to open pull requests or simply fork it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Grefendor/OrbitCopy\">https://github.com/Grefendor/OrbitCopy</a></p> <p>Hope you have nice holidays</p> <p><strong>Grefendor</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Grefendor\"> /u/Grefendor </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzl05e/i_created_orbitcopy_a_gui_interface_to_use_ssh_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pzl05e/i_created_orbitcopy_a_gui_interface_to_use_ssh_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

      "title": "The osm-9 mutant strain is defective in the recovery phase of long-term memory dynamics",
      "content": "Memory by definition is the storage of learned information from experiences where it can be recalled in the future. Memory is essential for organisms of any level, from single celled bacteria to complex mammals like whales in order for them to adapt and survive. The storage of long term memory is known to start in the hippocampus but long-term memory is not simply contained in this one region in the brain but across multiple regions including the cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. This diversity of locations that memory can be located in prompts the question of what molecular components within the nervous system are required to establish and maintain long term memory. To dive into this, we utilize the simple neuroanatomy of C. elegans with only 302 neurons to examine the effects of mutations of specific genes on the success of forming long term memories. Previous work established that C. elegans with defective OSM-9 proteins are unable to sustain an aversion to butanone (an odor that they are innately attracted to) after it is paired once with a negative stimulus. This helped established the importance of OSM-9 proteins for short term memory but how can the OSM-9 protein, a homolog to human TRPV5 and TRPV6 commonly associated with recognizing pain and thermoregulation rather than memory, play a part within the dynamics of space training induced long term memory? Here we show that the loss of the OSM-9 protein affects the dynamics of memory consolidation, which is the process by which short term memory is converted to long term memory. Previously, OSM-9 protein was implicated in the formation of short term memory which was termed adaptation. Here, we examine spaced training induced memory that is resistant to re-feeding and depends on sleep. This study indicates that after spaced training, the OSM-9 protein is required for the conversion of short term memory to long term memory and not acquisition. Furthermore, we confirmed that 30 minutes on food after spaced training, Wild type C. elegans seem to lose their memory but gain it back 120 minutes after, emphasizing the dynamics of memory and revealing that it is not a smoothly continuous process. Our results demonstrate that TRPV containing channels plays a role in stabilizing memory for long term use. Analyzing the specific point in which the OSM-9 protein plays a part in reactivating memory may help pave the way to a more detailed understanding of memory dynamics and the processes involved in recovering memory. Future work includes: identifying where the loss of memory goes, whether its masked or truly disappears can further explain what the OSM-9 protein supports when long term memory is formed; understanding if OSM-9 is directly involved with the process of reviving the memory or is it involved in the development of the C. elegans circuit which allows for this process to occur.",

      "content": "Multisensory integration allows animals to combine cues from different sensory modalities to improve threat detection and drive evasive behaviors. While the zebrafish Tectum is classically viewed as a visual processing center, its role in integrating auditory and visual danger signals remains unclear. Using in vivo calcium imaging in larval zebrafish, we find that brief, high-amplitude auditory stimuli recruit a significant population of tectal neurons, predominantly in deep tectal layers. In addition, combined auditory and visual stimulation robustly increases both neural activity in the zebrafish Tectum and the probability of executing rapid escape maneuvers, especially for low salient stimuli. Interestingly, simultaneous auditory and visual cues engage more tectal neurons than either modality alone. Single neuron analysis reveal a population of neurons that respond to both auditory and visual cues, and importantly, shows that a proportion of those neurons only responds to multisensory stimulation. These results firmly establish the zebrafish Tectum as a multisensory processing area. Notably, the heightened tectal response during multisensory stimulation is strongly correlated with increased activity in hindbrain neurons implicated in escape-like motion events. These results link tectal multisensory integration to premotor circuits that drive behavioral output. Overall, our findings reveal the zebrafish Tectum as a hub for integration os audiovisual threat signals, and suggest a role of tectal multisensory processing in enhancing behavioral escape responses.",

      "title": "Implications of recursive Bayesian Sensory Inference",
      "content": "In this article, we examine how the balance between velocity-based and position-based proprioceptive feedback influences state estimation during motor control. We introduce a computational model of arm state inference grounded in Bayesian sensory integration and compare its behaviour to findings from three classical sensorimotor studies. The model allows us to contrast the predicted behaviour of two proprioceptive configurations: one relying primarily on position signals and another relying primarily on velocity signals, reflecting the distinct contributions of type II and type Ia muscle spindle afferents. Our simulations show that a system with strong reliance on velocity-based feedback tends to represent movement relative to previously estimated positions. In a simulated reaching task with briefly presented offset visual feedback, such an Agent produces systematic endpoint errors even after visual feedback is removed. In contrast, an Agent relying mainly on positional feedback is able to correctly update its inferred hand position after visual feedback is removed, thereby limiting this type of biased endpoint errors. When biased visual feedback remains continuously available, or when muscle vibration is simulated, the two configurations produce very similar behaviour. These results indicate that markedly different assumptions about the weighting of positional and velocity proprioceptive cues can yield similar observable behaviour in some of the often-used experimental setups designed to probe state inference processes. This underscores the importance of carefully considering the composition of proprioceptive signals when building computational models and interpreting human sensorimotor experiments. We highlight the task conditions under which our model predicts clear behavioural differences arising from the relative contribution of velocity versus positional feedback.",
