      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "An Exploration of the Electrocorticogram Signatures Evoked by Ultrasound Thalamus Stimulation Under Isoflurane Anesthesia in Rats",
      "content": "Objective: The transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) on the thalamus can indirectly induce cortical response. Studies have shown that general anesthetic induced unconsciousness is related to interruption of thalamocortical connectivity. However, the neural mechanism of how anesthesia levels influence cortical responses during ultrasound thalamus stimulation has never been explored yet. And it remains unknown what cortical responses signatures are evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation under different anesthesia levels. Methods: We recorded multichannel electrocorticogram (ECoG) evoked by ultrasound thalamus stimulation of rats at various isoflurane concentrations (i.e., 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0% (v/v)). We analyzed ECoG signatures in temporal, spatial, and frequency domains by using the ultrasound-evoked potentials (UEPs), omega complexity (OC), and phase amplitude coupling (PAC), respectively. Results: The pattern of UEPs was influenced by the anesthesia level, and the response amplitude of UEPs increased with the increase in anesthesia level (0.5% vs. 1.0% and 1.5% (v/v), p < 0.05). Also, the OC of stimulated ECoG decreased with the increase in anesthesia level (at the 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05). The TUS promoted the coupling between the amplitude and the phase (at the 1.5% and 2.0% (v/v), p < 0.05), and the modulation index of PAC was anesthesia level-dependent. Conclusion: The cortical response induced by ultrasound thalamus stimulation is related to the anesthesia level. TUS on the thalamus combined with ECoG (TUS-ECoG) may be a potential non-invasive neuromodulation approach for understanding consciousness. Significance: This work supplied further implications on the neuromodulatory mechanisms and evaluative applications of TUS under general anesthesia.",

      "title": "Pulmonary Hypertension Detection From Heart Sound Analysis",
      "content": "The detection of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) from the computer analysis of digitized heart sounds is a low-cost and non-invasive solution for early PH detection and screening. We present an extensive cross-domain evaluation methodology with varying animals (humans and porcine animals) and varying auscultation technologies (phonocardiography and seisomocardiography) evaluated across four methods. We introduce PH-ELM, a resource-efficient PH detection model based on the extreme learning machine that is smaller ($300\\times$ fewer parameters), energy efficient ($532\\times$ fewer watts of power), faster ($36\\times$ faster to train, $44\\times$ faster at inference), and more accurate on out-of-distribution testing (improves median accuracy by 0.09 area under the ROC curve (auROC)) in comparison to a previously best performing deep network. We make four observations from our analysis: (a) digital auscultation is a promising technology for the detection of pulmonary hypertension; (b) seismocardiography (SCG) signals and phonocardiography (PCG) signals are interchangeable to train PH detectors; (c) porcine heart sounds in the training data can be used to evaluate PH from human heart sounds (the PH-ELM model preserves 88 to 95% of the best in-distribution baseline performance); (d) predictive performance of PH detection can be mostly preserved with as few as 10 heartbeats and capturing up to approximately 200 heartbeats per subject can improve performance.",

      "title": "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound Modulates Visual Thalamus in a Nonhuman Primate Model",
      "content": "Objective: The thalamus plays a pivotal role as a neural hub, integrating and distributing visual information to cortical regions responsible for visual processing. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has emerged as a promising non-invasive brain stimulation technology, enabling modulation of neural circuits with high spatial precision. This study investigates the tFUS neuromodulation at visual thalamus and characterizes the resultant effects on interconnected visual areas in a nonhuman primate model. Methods: Experiments were conducted on a rhesus macaque trained in a visual fixation task, combining tFUS stimulation with simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial recordings from area V4, a region closely linked to the thalamus. Ultrasound was delivered through a 128-element random array ultrasound transducer operating at 700 kHz, with the focus steered onto the pulvinar of the thalamus based on neuroanatomical atlas and individual brain model. Results: EEG source imaging revealed localized tFUS-induced activities in the thalamus, midbrain, and visual cortical regions. Critically, tFUS stimulation of the pulvinar can elicit robust neural responses in V4 without visual input, manifested as significant modulations in local field potentials, elevated alpha and gamma power, corroborating the functional thalamocortical connectivity. Furthermore, the tFUS neuromodulatory effects on visually-evoked V4 activities were region-specific within the thalamus and dependent on ultrasound pulse repetition frequency. Conclusion: This work provides direct electrophysiological evidence demonstrating the capability of tFUS in modulating the visual thalamus and its functional impact on interconnected cortical regions in a large mammalian model, paving the way for potential investigations for tFUS treating visual, sensory, and cognitive impairments.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "content": "IntroductionNative and non-native listeners rely on different neural strategies when processing speech in their respective native and non-native languages, encoding distinct features of speech from acoustic to linguistic content in different ways. This study investigated differences in neural responses between native English and Korean speaker when they passively listened to speech in their native and non-native languages using electroencephalography.MethodsThe study employed two approaches to examine neural responses: Temporal Response Functions (TRFs) measure how the brain tracks continuous speech features (i.e., speech envelope, phoneme onset, phonemic surprisal, and semantic dissimilarity), and Phoneme-Related Potentials (PRPs) assess phonemic-level processes.ResultsNon-native speakers showed significantly stronger neural tracking of the speech envelope, but no group differences for higher-level linguistic features within analyses of TRFs. PRP analyses, however, revealed distinct response patterns across phoneme categories, with non-native speakers showing heightened peaks.ConclusionThe results suggest that non-native speakers rely more on bottom-up acoustic cues during passive listening. TRFs and PRPs provide information on neural markers that indicate how speech is processed differently depending on the listener's native language and language experience.",

      "content": "Public speaking anxiety (PSA) is a widespread condition with profound psychological, educational, and occupational consequences. Despite increasing academic attention, few studies have systematically mapped the thematic development of PSA research or anticipated future directions. This study employs a semantically enriched framework integrating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with Word2Vec to analyze 990 peer-reviewed journal articles (1995\u20132024) retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection, spanning SSCI, SCI-Expanded, ESCI, and A&amp;HCI indices. Nine major thematic clusters are identified, covering topics such as mental health distress, physiological reactivity, language apprehension, social phobia, and virtual reality interventions. Thematic evolution across four historical phases reveals growing conceptual convergence and an increasing focus on digital anxiety and assessment technologies. A Sankey diagram illustrates patterns of thematic continuity and transformation, highlighting both enduring topics and emerging lines of inquiry. To predict future research frontiers, two novelty indicators\u2014Cluster Novelty and Topic Novelty\u2014are introduced. Clusters focused on language learning (Topic 4), virtual therapy (Topic 6), and psychometric tools (Topic 8) emerge as the most temporally novel. This study provides a comprehensive, data-driven mapping of PSA research and offers methodological guidance for future interdisciplinary bibliometric analyses.",

Based on SD results, we selected stimuli to create multisensory environments. These were presented in immersive virtual reality (VR) to 27 participants. Emotional responses were assessed via heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and electrodermal activity (EDA).ResultsSD analysis identified cross-modal associations between sensory stimuli and retail zones, allowing refinement of semantic positioning. VR experiments revealed that HRV significantly increased in pleasant environments, indicating enhanced parasympathetic activation. HR and EDA showed no significant correlation with emotional valence, though both displayed trends toward reduction in pleasant conditions.DiscussionOur findings suggest that HRV is a reliable physiological marker of consumers\u2019 approach behavior in multisensory retail environments, whereas HR and EDA are less sensitive.

      "content": "ObjectiveThis pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) training with robotic hand assistance for upper limb rehabilitation, and to explore preliminary neural markers in ischemic stroke patients.MethodsThree post-stroke participants performed MI tasks combined with exoskeleton-assisted movements to facilitate rehabilitation training. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded to assess the neural correlates of MI. Functional outcomes were evaluated using standard assessment tools.ResultsOur results demonstrated significant improvements in motor function across all participants. Additionally, EEG analysis revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the high-alpha band power at motor cortex locations, with individual differences in both the frequency and power of neural activity. However, no significant trends in neural activity were observed across the training sessions.ConclusionThese findings suggest that MI-based BCI training, combined with robotic assistance, offer a promising approach for enhancing upper limb function in ischemic stroke patients.",

      "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "title": "DWMamba: a structure-aware adaptive state space network for image quality improvement",
      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

      "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications.

      "title": "Interhemispheric EEG coherence as a candidate biomarker in gambling disorder: evidence of frontal hyperconnectivity and posterior disconnectivity",
      "content": "BackgroundGambling Disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction marked by impaired decision-making and poor impulse control. We investigated whether resting-state interhemispheric quantitative EEG (qEEG) coherence\u2014a measure of functional connectivity between homologous cortical regions\u2014could serve as a biomarker of GD.MethodsTwenty-nine male patients with GD and 45 healthy male controls underwent resting-state qEEG recording. Coherence was computed for homologous electrode pairs across delta, theta, alpha, and beta bands. Group differences were analyzed using independent-samples t-tests; associations with disorder duration were assessed via age-controlled partial correlations.ResultsConsistent with our hypothesis, GD participants exhibited frontal pole hypercoherence (Fp1\u2013Fp2) across delta, theta, and beta bands, which is likely influenced by prefrontal/orbitofrontal generators. In contrast, GD showed hypocoherence in temporal (T3\u2013T4, T5\u2013T6), central (C3\u2013C4), and parietal (P3\u2013P4) regions across these frequencies. Greater disorder duration was associated with lower beta coherence at F3\u2013F4 and Fp1\u2013Fp2, and higher delta coherence at O1\u2013O2.ConclusionsThese findings reveal a dual pattern of interhemispheric connectivity disruption in GD\u2014hypercoherence at frontal pole sites and hypocoherence in sensorimotor and attentional posterior networks\u2014supporting theoretical models of addiction neurocircuitry. Resting-state qEEG coherence holds promise as a clinically relevant biomarker for GD and may inform the development of neuromodulatory interventions aimed at network rebalancing.",
