      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

However, SNNs require computations across multiple timesteps, resulting in increased latency, heightened energy consumption, and additional memory access overhead. Techniques to reduce SNN latency down to a unit timestep have emerged to realize true superior energy efficiency over ANNs. Nonetheless, this latency reduction often comes at the expense of...",
