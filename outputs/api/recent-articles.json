      "title": "A Framework for Optimizing Human-Machine Interaction in Classification Systems",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05974v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Automated decision systems increasingly rely on human oversight to ensure accuracy in uncertain cases. This paper presents a practical framework for optimizing such human-in-the-loop classification systems using a double-threshold policy. Instead of relying on a single decision cutoff, the system defines two thresholds (a lower and an upper) to automatically accept or reject confident cases while routing ambiguous ones for human review. We formalize this problem as an optimization task that balances system accuracy against human review workload and demonstrate its behavior through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results quantify how different probability score distributions affect the efficiency of human intervention and identify the regions of diminishing returns where additional review yields minimal benefit. The framework provides a general, reproducible method for improving reliability in any decision pipeline requiring selective human validation, including applications in entity resolution, fraud detection, medical triage, and content moderation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05871v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interviews are commonplace in HCI. This paper presents a novel documentary method of interpretation that supports analysis of the topics contained within a collection of transcripts, topics that are endogenous to it and which elaborate participants collective reasoning about issues of relevance to research. We contrast endogenous topic analysis with established qualitative approaches, including content analysis, grounded theory, interpretative phenomenological analysis, and thematic analysis, to draw out the distinctive character of the documentary method of interpretation. Unlike established methods, the DMI does not require that the analyst be proficient in qualitative analysis, or have sound knowledge of underlying theories and methods. The DMI is a members method, not a social science method, that relies on mastery of natural language; a competence most people possess.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05825v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Passive brain-computer interfaces offer a potential source of implicit feedback for alignment of large language models, but most mental state decoding has been done in controlled tasks. This paper investigates whether established EEG classifiers for mental workload and implicit agreement can be transferred to spoken human-AI dialogue. We introduce two conversational paradigms - a Spelling Bee task and a sentence completion task- and an end-to-end pipeline for transcribing, annotating, and aligning word-level conversational events with continuous EEG classifier output. In a pilot study, workload decoding showed interpretable trends during spoken interaction, supporting cross-paradigm transfer. For implicit agreement, we demonstrate continuous application and precise temporal alignment to conversational events, while identifying limitations related to construct transfer and asynchronous application of event-based classifiers. Overall, the results establish feasibility and constraints for integrating passive BCI signals into conversational AI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard has emerged as a widely adopted specification for exchanging structured clinical data across healthcare systems. However, raw FHIR resources are often complex, verbose, and difficult for clinicians and analysts to interpret without specialized tooling. This paper presents a lightweight, browser-based system that improves the accessibility of FHIR data by automatically transforming raw JSON resources into human-readable PDF and Excel reports, along with interactive data visualizations. The system supports both remote retrieval of FHIR resources from server endpoints and the upload of local FHIR JSON files, enabling both online and offline analysis. Using a modular React architecture with jsPDF, xlsx, and Recharts, the tool parses, normalizes, visualizes, and exports FHIR data in an intuitive format. Evaluation results demonstrate that the system enhances interpretability and usability while preserving the semantic integrity of FHIR structures. Limitations and future extensions, including expanded FHIR profile support and clinical validation, are discussed.",

      "title": "SAFE: Secure and Accurate Federated Learning for Privacy-Preserving Brain-Computer Interfaces",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05789v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are widely adopted due to their efficiency and portability; however, their decoding algorithms still face multiple challenges, including inadequate generalization, adversarial vulnerability, and privacy leakage. This paper proposes Secure and Accurate FEderated learning (SAFE), a federated learning-based approach that protects user privacy by keeping data local during model training. SAFE employs local batch-specific normalization to mitigate cross-subject feature distribution shifts and hence improves model generalization. It further enhances adversarial robustness by introducing perturbations in both the input space and the parameter space through federated adversarial training and adversarial weight perturbation. Experiments on five EEG datasets from motor imagery (MI) and event-related potential (ERP) BCI paradigms demonstrated that SAFE consistently outperformed 14 state-of-the-art approaches in both decoding accuracy and adversarial robustness, while ensuring privacy protection. Notably, it even outperformed centralized training approaches that do not consider privacy protection at all. To our knowledge, SAFE is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve high decoding accuracy, strong adversarial robustness, and reliable privacy protection without using any calibration data from the target subject, making it highly desirable for real-world BCIs.",

      "title": "Advancing credit mobility through stakeholder-informed AI design and adoption",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05666v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Transferring from a 2-year to a 4-year college is crucial for socioeconomic mobility, yet students often face challenges ensuring their credits are fully recognized, leading to delays in their academic progress and unexpected costs. Determining whether courses at different institutions are equivalent (i.e., articulation) is essential for successful credit transfer, as it minimizes unused credits and increases the likelihood of bachelor's degree completion. However, establishing articulation agreements remains time- and resource-intensive, as all candidate articulations are reviewed manually. Although recent efforts have explored the use of artificial intelligence to support this work, its use in articulation practice remains limited. Given these challenges and the need for scalable support, this study applies artificial intelligence to suggest articulations between institutions in collaboration with the State University of New York system, one of the largest systems of higher education in the US. To develop our methodology, we first surveyed articulation staff and faculty to assess adoption rates of baseline algorithmic recommendations and gather feedback on perceptions and concerns about these recommendations. Building on these insights, we developed a supervised alignment method that addresses superficial matching and institutional biases in catalog descriptions, achieving a 5.5-fold improvement in accuracy over previous methods. Based on articulation predictions of this method and a 61% average surveyed adoption rate among faculty and staff, these findings project a 12-fold increase in valid credit mobility opportunities that would otherwise remain unrealized. This study suggests that stakeholder-informed design of AI in higher education administration can expand student credit mobility and help reshape current institutional decision-making in course articulation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05651v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Engaging learners in dialogue around controversial issues is essential for examining diverse values and perspectives in pluralistic societies. While prior research has identified productive discussion moves mainly in STEM-oriented contexts, less is known about what constitutes productive discussion in ethical and value-laden discussions. This study investigates productive discussion in AI ethics dilemmas using a dialogue-centric learning analytics approach. We analyze small-group discussions among undergraduate students through a hybrid method that integrates expert-informed coding with data-driven topic modeling. This process identifies 14 discussion moves across five categories, including Elaborating Ideas, Position Taking, Reasoning & Justifications, Emotional Expression, and Discussion Management. We then examine how these moves relate to discussion quality and analyze sequential interaction patterns using Ordered Network Analysis. Results indicate that emotive and experiential arguments and explicit acknowledgment of ambiguity are strong positive predictors of discussion quality, whereas building on ideas is negatively associated. Ordered Network Analysis further reveals that productive discussions are characterized by interactional patterns that connect emotional expressions to evidence-based reasoning. These findings suggest that productive ethical discussion is grounded not only in reasoning and justification but also in the constructive integration of emotional expression.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05516v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As virtual reality (VR) becomes more widely adopted, secure and efficient text entry is an increasingly critical need. In this paper, we identify a vulnerability in a state-of-the-art secure VR text entry method and introduce a novel virtual radial keyboard designed to achieve a balance between security with usability. Keys are arranged alphabetically in a circular layout, with each key selected by controller rotation and dynamically expanding to facilitate precise selection. A randomized rotation mechanism shifts the keyboard after each keystroke, preserving relative key positions while disrupting absolute spatial mappings to protect against inference attacks. We conducted a within-subject study (N=30) comparing our method with the prior secure technique and a standard QWERTY keyboard. Results showed that the radial keyboard significantly improves resistance to keystroke prediction attacks while incurring a tradeoff in entry speed and subjective workload due to the unfamiliar non-QWERTY layout. However, both quantitative trends and qualitative feedback indicate strong potential for performance improvements with practice. We also discuss design implications, possible interface refinements, and directions for future work, including layout variations and visual enhancements.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05450v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study examines the impact of feedback on Electroencephalography (EEG) activity and performance during the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. In a within-subject design, eleven participants completed the test under Feedback and No-Feedback conditions. Using the principles of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) and Ordered Network Analysis (ONA), we extend these network-based models to explore the link between neural dynamics and task outcomes. ENA results showed that feedback is associated with stronger connections between higher frequency EEG bands (Beta and Gamma) and correct responses, while the absence of feedback activated lower frequency bands (Theta and Alpha). ONA further disclosed directional shifts toward higher frequency activity preceding correct answers in the Feedback condition, whereas the No-Feedback condition showed more self-connections in lower bands and a higher occurrence of wrong answers, suggesting less effective reasoning strategies without feedback. Both ENA and ONA revealed statistically significant differences between conditions (p = 0.01, Cohen's d > 2). This study highlights the methodological benefits of integrating EEG with ENA and ONA for network analysis, capturing both temporal and relational dynamics, as well as the practical insight that feedback can foster more effective reasoning processes and improve task performance.",

These activities compile knowledge, provide a context enveloping the solution, and answer questions. With Generative AI, practitioners can go beyond sampling existing media towards instantly generating and remixing new ones. We refer to this convergence as 'protosampling'. Using existing literature we ground a definition for protosampling and operationalize it through Atelier, a canvas-like system that leverages a variety of generative image and video models for visual creation. Atelier: (1) blends the spaces for thinking and creation, where both references and generated assets co-exist in one space, (2) provides various encapsulated technical workflows that focus on the activity at hand, and (3) enables navigating emergence through interactive visualizations, smart search, and collections. Protosampling as a lens reframes creative work to emphasize the process itself and how seemingly disjointed thoughts can tightly interweave into a final solution.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.02606v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Neuronal systems often preserve their characteristic functions and signalling patterns, also referred to as regimes, despite parametric uncertainties and variations. For neural models having uncertain parameters with a known probability distribution, probabilistic robustness analysis (PRA) allows us to understand and quantify under which uncertainty conditions a regime is preserved in expectation. We introduce a new computational framework for the efficient and systematic PRA of dynamical systems in neuroscience and we show its efficacy in analysing well-known neural models that exhibit multiple dynamical regimes: the Hindmarsh-Rose model for single neurons and the Jansen-Rit model for cortical columns. Given a model subject to parametric uncertainty, we employ generalised polynomial chaos to derive mean neural activity signals, which are then used to assess the amount of parametric uncertainty that the system can withstand while preserving the current regime, thereby quantifying the regime's robustness to such uncertainty. To assess persistence of regimes, we propose new metrics, which we apply to recurrence plots obtained from the mean neural activity signals. The overall result is a novel, general computational methodology that combines recurrence plot analysis and systematic persistence analysis to assess how much the uncertain model parameters can vary, with respect to their nominal value, while preserving the nominal regimes in expectation. We summarise the PRA results through probabilistic regime preservation (PRP) plots, which capture the effect of parametric uncertainties on the robustness of dynamical regimes in the considered models.",

      "title": "An outlook on extracellular waveforms produced by the three neuronal compartments",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.05893v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The brain is composed of billions of neurons with virtually endless morphologies and ion channel compositions, resulting in unique extracellular waveforms. Nevertheless, almost all neuronal morphologies can be reduced to a simple architecture made of three principal compartments: 1) the soma and nearby axonal hillock, 2) axonal projections ending in arbors or single synaptic contacts, and 3) dendrites. This review offers a perspective on how these three ubiquitous neuronal compartments can be identified and how they shape the extracellularly recorded waveforms, when spatial considerations are taken into account. This outlook utilizes biophysical modelling to complement existing experimental observations. Modeling has predicted a rich landscape of putative extracellular waveforms based on morphology, channel density, and sequential temporal activation. Recent advances in extracellular in vivo recording, combining low noise with high spatial density of recording sites, have improved the precision of extracellular waveform measurements, particularly in capturing waveforms beyond the classical somatic spikes, and in some cases, combinations originating from different compartments. This review aims to reorganize extracellular waveform heterogeneity by separating signals stemming from three neuronal compartments using three dimensions: amplitude, duration, and spatial extent or footprint. In doing so, we argue for a change of perspective, looking beyond somatic spikes to include spatiality and waveform combinations.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05284v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the brain, neural activity undergoes directed flows between states, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry. At the same time, animals also exhibit irreversible flows between behavioral states. Yet it remains unclear whether -- and how -- irreversibility in the brain relates to irreversibility in behavior. Here, we explore this connection in the hippocampus, where neural activity encodes physical location. We show that hippocampal irreversibility can be quantified using the time-delayed cross-correlations between neurons. As a mouse moves along a virtual track, we find that physical flows through the animal's environment generate neural flows through its cognitive map. Strikingly, this neural irreversibility is explained by a minimal model with only three parameters: the average velocity of the mouse, the variance in this velocity, and the resolution of the neural encoding. Together, these results provide a mechanistic understanding of irreversibility in the hippocampus and shed light on the links between symmetry breaking in the brain and behavior.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.05277v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.",

      "title": "Decoding semantic categories: insights from an fMRI ALE meta analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The human brain organizes conceptual knowledge into semantic categories; however, the extent to which these categories share common or distinct neural representations remains unclear. This study aims to clarify this organizational structure by identifying consistent, modality-controlled activation patterns across several widely used and frequently investigated semantic domains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. By quantifying the distinctiveness and overlap among these patterns, we provide a more precise foundation for understanding the brain\u2019s semantic architecture, as well as for applications such as semantic brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI). Approach. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 fMRI studies covering six semantic categories: animals, tools, food, music, body parts, and pain. Using activation likelihood estimation, we identified convergent activation patterns for each category while controlling for stimulus modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and written). Subsequently, Jaccard-based overlap analyses were performed to quantify the degree of neural commonality and separability across concept-modality pairs, thereby revealing the underlying structure of representational similarity. Main results. Distinct yet partially overlapping activation networks were identified for each semantic category. Tools and animals showed shared activity in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal regions, reflecting common object-based visual processing. In contrast, food-related stimuli primarily recruited limbic and subcortical structures associated with affective and motivational processing. Music and animal sounds overlapped within the superior temporal and insular cortices, whereas body parts and pain engaged occipito-parietal and cingulo-insular networks, respectively. Together, these findings reveal a hierarchically organized and modality-dependent semantic architecture in the human brain. Significance. This meta-analysis offers a quantitative and integrative characterization of how semantic knowledge is distributed and differentiated across cortical systems. By demonstrating how conceptual content and sensory modality jointly shape neural organization, the study refines theoretical models of semantic cognition and provides a methodological basis for evaluating conceptual separability. These insights have direct implications for semantic neural decoding and for the development of BCI systems grounded in meaning-based neural representations.",
