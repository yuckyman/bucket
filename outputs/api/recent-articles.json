      "content": "(1) Background: Essential oils (EOs) have emerged as promising antibacterial agents due to their broad-spectrum activity and low risk of resistance development. Therefore, this review aimed to assess the effectiveness of EOs against Gram-positive ESKAPE pathogens, and to evaluate their safety and toxicity in mammalian cells. (2) Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. (3) Results: Heracleum pyrenaicum exhibited the most potent effect, with a MIC of...",

      "content": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold significant promise as energy-efficient alternatives to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, SNNs require computations across multiple timesteps, resulting in increased latency, heightened energy consumption, and additional memory access overhead. Techniques to reduce SNN latency down to a unit timestep have emerged to realize true superior energy efficiency over ANNs. Nonetheless, this latency reduction often comes at the expense of...",
