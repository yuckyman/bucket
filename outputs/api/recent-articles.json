      "title": "The Neuroprotective Effects of Ocimum gratissimum-Supplemented Diet on Scopolamine-Induced Memory Impairment in Mice Model of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Background: Cognitive decline is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative illness primarily caused by the buildup of amyloid plaque, which is brought on by oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Currently, therapeutic agents are focused on addressing clinical symptoms with associated side effects. This study aims to explore the neuroprotective potential of Ocimum gratissimum, a plant known for its richness in bioactive compounds. By investigating its effects on cognitive health, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature regarding dietary interventions for Alzheimer's disease. Methods: Thirty-six animals were divided into six groups of six mice each: the control group received distilled water intraperitoneally; the scopolamine group received only scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); the three test groups were fed 5%, 10%, and 20% Ocimum gratissimum-supplemented diets while also receiving scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.); and the positive control group received Donepezil (5 mg/kg) followed by the injection of scopolamine (1 mg/kg i.p.). Donepezil was administered orally 30 minutes before the scopolamine injection. All treatments were administered daily for 14 consecutive days. Results: The supplemented diet groups showed significantly improved spatial memory and navigation compared to the scopolamine-only group. Biochemical analyses revealed that O. gratissimum mitigated scopolamine-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, with marked improvements in antioxidant enzyme levels, reduced lipid peroxidation, and modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion: Dietary intervention using Ocimum gratissimum leaf was able to improve spatial memory and protect against memory impairment, suggesting its potential as a neuroprotective agent against Alzheimer's disease-like pathology.",

      "content": "Small vessel disease (SVD) impacts healthy aging of organs across the body, yet its contributions to adverse brain aging remain poorly defined. Here we show thromboinflammation, a core feature of SVD, as a driver of adverse brain aging. We identify cerebrospinal fluid fibrinogen as a marker of brain thromboinflammation and screen neurovascular biosignatures mediating its impact on synaptic vulnerability along the full spectrum of brain aging from cognitively typical, amyloid-negative to cognitively impaired, amyloid-positive older adults. We identified 53 proteins mediating the effect of fibrinogen on synaptic markers in 1,655 donors from three independent cohorts. Single-cell transcriptomic mapping revealed mediator enrichment in neurovascular unit cells. Pathway analysis demonstrated dysregulation of angiogenesis, fibrosis, and immune signaling. Vascular and microglial-enriched biosignatures associated with compromised white matter integrity. These findings implicate thromboinflammation as an early, amyloid-independent pathway to neurodegeneration and tauopathy, establishing vascular health as fundamental to preserving brain healthspan.",

      "title": "Frontal and Parietal Contributions to Proprioception and Motor Skill Learning",
      "content": "Motor skill learning is the process of developing new movements with practice until they can be performed automatically. This necessitates the interaction of high-level cognitive processes with low-level sensorimotor mechanisms. Skill learning involves not only changes in the motor system but also proprioception (position sense). Proprioceptive deficits increase variability and decrease accuracy of movement. The somatosensory cortex, where low-level proprioception is processed, is known to play a role in motor skill learning, but the involvement of higher-level proprioceptive regions is unclear. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been linked to the high-level early stages of motor learning, and indirectly to proprioception. Supramarginal gyrus (SMG), an interface area between motor and sensory cortices, has been linked to higher-order proprioceptive processing. In this study, we asked how activity in DLPFC and SMG influences motor skill learning. Participants learned an upper limb motor skill designed to be spatially complex and dependent on proprioception: tracing a two-dimensional maze as accurately as possible within the desired speed range, using a Kinarm Endpoint robotic manipulandum. Proprioceptive acuity (sensitivity and bias) was assessed before and after continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) was applied to inhibit activity in DLPFC, SMG, or Sham. To measure motor skill, movement accuracy and variability were examined at the trained speed as well as at a faster (more difficult) and a slower (easier) speed. Skill was assessed before and after cTBS, after 40 training trials (early learning) and after another 80 trials (late learning). All three groups showed improvements in movement accuracy and variance, indicating they learned the maze tracing skill. However, the Sham group improved movement variability at the faster speed significantly more than the DLPFC or SMG groups did. This suggests that DLPFC and SMG are important for the more challenging aspects of motor skill learning, consistent with their association with higher-level proprioceptive function.",

      "content": "De novo protein synthesis is required for long-lasting synaptic plasticity and memory, but it comes with a great metabolic cost. In the mammalian brain, it remains unclear which cell types and biological mechanisms are critical for sensing and responding to increased metabolic demand. Here we demonstrate that microglia, resident macrophages of the brain, coordinate metabolic coupling between endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neurons to fuel protein synthesis in active neurons. Increasing metabolic demand via a motor task stimulates microglia to secrete the hypoxia-responsive protein CYR61, increasing glucose transporter expression in brain vasculature. Depleting microglia reduces training-induced metabolic fluxes and neuronal protein synthesis, which can be reproduced by blocking CYR61 signaling. Thus, we define a neuroimmune metabolic circuit required for on-demand protein synthesis in mouse motor cortex.",

      "title": "Extracellular space diffusion modelling identifies distinct functional advantages of archetypical glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse geometries",
      "content": "The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a convoluted compartment of nano- and microscale interconnected ducts. A key step in signaling between neural cells is diffusion of signaling molecules through the ECS, yet, signaling is generally considered solely from the stance of cells and their properties. Where ECS diffusion is addressed, this is commonly done using volume-averaging techniques blind to individual signaling events and ECS geometry. We hypothesized that ECS geometry can shape local diffusion and thereby tune signaling arising from point-sources. To access the scale of individual transmitter release events and synapse geometries, we developed a computational diffusion model, DifFlux, based on super-resolved images of hippocampal ECS in live mouse brain slices and combined this with single molecule Monte Carlo diffusion simulations. Our approach allows us to simulate diffusion of molecules of our choosing in true live ECS geometries. We asked how the ECS shapes local diffusion in dense neuropil and along larger cellular processes in CA1 stratum radiatum. We observed local diffusional anisotropy and directionality imposed by ECS geometry. Further, we identified distinct functional advantages of dendritic spine and somatodendritic synapse ECS geometries, shedding light on the longstanding conundrum of why glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses are so conspicuously morphologically different. Our modelling broadly identifies ECS structure as a direct modulator of extrasynaptic signaling that can operate in parallel to conventional regulation mechanisms.",

      "title": "Natural Scene Coding Consistency in Genetically-Defined Cell Populations",
      "content": "Understanding how genetically-defined cell populations encode visual information remains a fundamental challenge in systems neuroscience. While extensive research has characterized individual cell responses to simple stimuli such as static gratings, the population-level coding principles that govern naturalistic visual processing across cell types remain largely unexplored. We analyzed population responses from 43,018 neurons across 12 genetically-defined cell types in 243 mice from the Allen Brain Observatory, comparing representational geometry between natural scenes and static gratings. We found that inhibitory cell populations (VIP, SST, PV) cluster distinctly in representational space almost independent of anatomical location when responding to natural scenes but not static gratings, suggesting preserved cell-type specific computational functions specific for natural scenes. To assess coding capacity of a population of neurons, we developed Inter-Individual Representational Similarity (IIRS), which measures consistency of neural representations across different individuals in response to an ensemble of stimuli. All inhibitory populations showed significantly higher IIRS for natural scenes compared to static gratings, indicating consistent encoding of naturalistic visual features across individuals comparable to excitatory populations (Cux2, Rorb, Rbp4). Parallel analysis of neural networks trained on natural images (ImageNet) with different random initializations revealed similar patterns: models showed higher cross-initialization similarity for naturalistic stimuli compared to static gratings, suggesting that cross-individual consistency emerges when experimental stimuli engage the features that neural circuits are adapted to extract. These findings establish IIRS as a metric for identifying coding capacity in cell populations and reveal that inhibitory cell populations encode consistent aspects of natural scenes across individuals, indicating these circuits may have evolved specialized tuning for naturalistic visual environments.",

      "title": "Global organisation of structural covariance networks derived from parcellated cortical surface area in atypical populations.",
      "content": "Higher-order features of brain organisation are powerful measures for understanding the relationship between brain and experience. In particular, the global arrangement of structural features of the cortex provides insight into neurodevelopmental processes that underlie individual differences in perception and cognition. Structural covariance networks (SCNs), which capture regional coordination of brain morphometry, are an efficient method to derive global properties of the cortex. However, their interpretation relies on an array of methodological choices that are often inconsistent between studies. Using a hierarchically-clustered version of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, we constructed SCNs of regional cortical surface area for groups with four different conditions -- synaesthesia, autism, early psychosis, and anxiety or depression -- and compared global network properties with those of age- and sex-matched controls. SCNs for synaesthesia and autism showed globally stronger connectivity, with specific increases at moderate cortical distances, as well as lower network complexity. Conversely, the SCN for early psychosis showed a globally lower connectivity and a greater complexity, while depression and anxiety showed few differences compared to controls. The results for autism and depression were replicated across two datasets each. These findings support the notion that synaesthesia and autism share neurodevelopmental mechanisms, while psychosis may involve a diverging process. This study is also an important proof of principle for analysing diverse populations under one methodological framework.",

      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",
