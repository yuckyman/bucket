      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Developer Interaction Patterns with Proactive AI: A Five-Day Field Study",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10253v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current in-IDE AI coding tools typically rely on time-consuming manual prompting and context management, whereas proactive alternatives that anticipate developer needs without explicit invocation remain underexplored. Understanding when humans are receptive to such proactive AI assistance during their daily work remains an open question in human-AI interaction research. We address this gap through a field study of proactive AI assistance in professional developer workflows. We present a five-day in-the-wild study with 15 developers who interacted with a proactive feature of an AI assistant integrated into a production-grade IDE that offers code quality suggestions based on in-IDE developer activity. We examined 229 AI interventions across 5,732 interaction points to understand how proactive suggestions are received across workflow stages, how developers experience them, and their perceived impact. Our findings reveal systematic patterns in human receptivity to proactive suggestions: interventions at workflow boundaries (e.g., post-commit) achieved 52% engagement rates, while mid-task interventions (e.g., on declined edit) were dismissed 62% of the time. Notably, well-timed proactive suggestions required significantly less interpretation time than reactive suggestions (45.4s versus 101.4s, W = 109.00, r = 0.533, p = 0.0016), indicating enhanced cognitive alignment. This study provides actionable implications for designing proactive coding assistants, including how to time interventions, align them with developer context, and strike a balance between AI agency and user control in production IDEs.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.10236v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: AI writing assistants can reduce effort and improve fluency, but they may also weaken writers' sense of authorship. We study this tension with an ownership-aware co-writing editor that offers on-demand, sentence-level suggestions and tests two common design choices: persona-based coaching and style personalization. In an online study (N=176), participants completed three professional writing tasks: an email without AI help, a proposal with generic AI suggestions, and a cover letter with persona-based coaching, while half received suggestions tailored to a brief sample of their prior writing. Across the two AI-assisted tasks, psychological ownership dropped relative to unassisted writing (about 0.85-1.0 points on a 7-point scale), even as cognitive load decreased (about 0.9 points) and quality ratings stayed broadly similar overall. Persona coaching did not prevent the ownership decline. Style personalization partially restored ownership (about +0.43) and increased AI incorporation in text (+5 percentage points). We distill five design patterns: on-demand initiation, micro-suggestions, voice anchoring, audience scaffolds, and point-of-decision provenance, to guide authorship-preserving writing tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.10232v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding complex parameter dependencies is critical for effective configuration and maintenance of software systems across diverse domains - from Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) to cloud infrastructure and database management. However, legacy tabular interfaces create a major bottleneck: engineers cannot easily comprehend how parameters relate across the system, leading to inefficient workflows, costly configuration errors, and reduced system trust - a fundamental program comprehension challenge in configuration-intensive software. This research evaluates whether interactive Sankey diagrams can improve comprehension of parameter dependencies compared to traditional spreadsheet interfaces. We employed a heuristic evaluation using the PURE method with three expert evaluators (UX design, simulation, and software development specialists) to compare a Sankey-based prototype to traditional tabular representations for core engineering tasks. Our key contribution demonstrates that flow-based parameter visualizations significantly reduce cognitive load (51% lower PURE scores) and interaction complexity (56% fewer steps) compared to traditional tables, while making parameter dependencies immediately visible rather than requiring mental reconstruction. By explicitly visualizing parameter relationships, Sankey diagrams address a core software visualization challenge: helping users comprehend complex system configurations without requiring deep tool-specific knowledge. While demonstrated through CAE software, this research contributes to program comprehension and software visualization by showing that dependency-aware visualizations can significantly improve understanding of configuration-intensive systems. The findings have implications for any software domain where comprehending complex parameter relationships is essential for effective system use and maintenance.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.10018v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While high-quality technology support can assist older adults in using digital applications, many struggle to articulate their issues due to unfamiliarity with technical terminology and age-related cognitive changes. This study examines these communication challenges and explores AI-based approaches to mitigate them. We conducted a diary study with English-speaking, community-dwelling older adults to collect asynchronous, technology-related queries and used reflexive thematic analysis to identify communication barriers. To address these barriers, we evaluated how foundation models can paraphrase older adults' queries to improve solution accuracy. Two controlled experiments followed: one with younger adults evaluating AI-rephrased queries and another with older adults evaluating AI-generated solutions. We also developed a pipeline using large language models to generate the first synthetic dataset of how older adults request tech support (OATS). We identified four key communication challenges: verbosity, incompleteness, over-specification, and under-specification. Our prompt-chaining approach using the large language model, GPT-4o, elicited contextual details, paraphrased the original query, and generated a solution. AI-rephrased queries significantly improved solution accuracy (69% vs. 46%) and Google search results (69% vs. 35%). Younger adults better understood AI-rephrased queries (93.7% vs. 65.8%) and reported greater confidence and ease. Older adults reported high perceived ability to answer contextual questions (89.8%) and follow solutions (94.7%), with high confidence and ease. OATS demonstrated strong fidelity and face validity. This work shows how foundation models can enhance technology support for older adults by addressing age-related communication barriers. The OATS dataset offers a scalable resource for developing equitable AI systems that better serve aging populations.",

Current centralized models require users to transmit sensitive browsing data to external services, which limits user control. In this paper, we present a browser extension that provides a viable in-browser alternative. We introduce a hybrid architecture that functions entirely on the client side, combining two components: (1) an adaptive probabilistic model that learns a user's behavioral policy from direct feedback, and (2) a Small Language Model (SLM), running in the browser, which is grounded by the probabilistic model to generate context-aware suggestions. To evaluate this approach, we conducted a three-week longitudinal user study with 18 participants. Our results show that this privacy-preserving approach is highly effective at adapting to individual user behavior, leading to measurably improved search efficiency. This work demonstrates that sophisticated AI assistance is achievable without compromising user privacy or data control.",

We investigate how user politeness behaviour shapes conversational outcomes in a cooking-assistance setting. First, we annotated 30 dialogues, identifying four distinct user clusters ranging from Hyperpolite to Hyperefficient. We then scaled up to 18,000 simulated conversations across five politeness profiles (including impolite) and three open-weight models. Results show that politeness is not only cosmetic: it systematically affects response length, informational gain, and efficiency. Engagement-seeking prompts produced up to 90% longer replies and 38% more information nuggets than hyper-efficient prompts, but at markedly lower density. Impolite inputs yielded verbose but less efficient answers, with up to 48% fewer nuggets per watt-hour compared to polite input. These findings highlight politeness as both a fairness and sustainability issue: conversational styles can advantage or disadvantage users, and \"polite\" requests may carry hidden energy costs. We discuss implications for inclusive and resource-aware design of information agents.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09896v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visual generative AI models are trained using a one-size-fits-all measure of aesthetic appeal. However, what is deemed \"aesthetic\" is inextricably linked to personal taste and cultural values, raising the question of whose taste is represented in visual generative AI models. In this work, we study an aesthetic evaluation model--LAION Aesthetic Predictor (LAP)--that is widely used to curate datasets to train visual generative image models, like Stable Diffusion, and evaluate the quality of AI-generated images. To understand what LAP measures, we audited the model across three datasets. First, we examined the impact of aesthetic filtering on the LAION-Aesthetics Dataset (approximately 1.2B images), which was curated from LAION-5B using LAP. We find that the LAP disproportionally filters in images with captions mentioning women, while filtering out images with captions mentioning men or LGBTQ+ people. Then, we used LAP to score approximately 330k images across two art datasets, finding the model rates realistic images of landscapes, cityscapes, and portraits from western and Japanese artists most highly. In doing so, the algorithmic gaze of this aesthetic evaluation model reinforces the imperial and male gazes found within western art history. In order to understand where these biases may have originated, we performed a digital ethnography of public materials related to the creation of LAP. We find that the development of LAP reflects the biases we found in our audits, such as the aesthetic scores used to train LAP primarily coming from English-speaking photographers and western AI-enthusiasts. In response, we discuss how aesthetic evaluation can perpetuate representational harms and call on AI developers to shift away from prescriptive measures of \"aesthetics\" toward more pluralistic evaluation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.09887v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Contemporary materials science research is heavily conducted in silico, involving massive simulations of the atomic-scale evolution of materials. Cataloging basic patterns in the atomic displacements is key to understanding and predicting the evolution of physical properties. However, the combinatorial complexity of the space of possible transitions coupled with the overwhelming amount of data being produced by high-throughput simulations make such an analysis extremely challenging and time-consuming for domain experts. The development of visual analytics systems that facilitate the exploration of simulation data is an active field of research. While these systems excel in identifying temporal regions of interest, they treat each timestep of a simulation as an independent event without considering the behavior of the atomic displacements between timesteps. We address this gap by introducing LAMDA, a visual analytics system that allows domain experts to quickly and systematically explore state-to-state transitions. In LAMDA, transitions are hierarchically categorized, providing a basis for cataloging displacement behavior, as well as enabling the analysis of simulations at different resolutions, ranging from very broad qualitative classes of transitions to very narrow definitions of unit processes. LAMDA supports navigating the hierarchy of transitions, enabling scientists to visualize the commonalities between different transitions in each class in terms of invariant features characterizing local atomic environments, and LAMDA simplifies the analysis by capturing user inputs through annotations. We evaluate our system through a case study and report on findings from our domain experts.",

      "title": "Who Owns My AI Twin? Data Ownership in a New World of Simulated Identities",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.09877v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The emergence of AI twins, digital replicas that encapsulate an individual's knowledge, memories, psychological traits, and behavioral patterns, raises novel legal and ethical challenges for data governance and personal identity. Built from personal data, these systems require a rethinking of what it means to exercise dominion over one's data and to maintain personal autonomy in an AI-mediated environment. This article argues that natural persons should be recognized as the moral and legal owners of their AI twins, which function as intimate extensions of the self rather than as proprietary technological artifacts. It critiques prevailing legal frameworks that prioritize technological infrastructure and platform control over data and individual autonomy, exposing their structural limitations. In response, the article advances a human-centric model of data governance grounded in individual dominion and a private-by-default principle. This approach proposes a reimagined social contract for AI-driven identities that strengthens personal agency, promotes equitable data stewardship, and better aligns legal norms with the socio-technical realities of AI twins.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.10515v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Acute stress alters cognitive performance, yet competing models make divergent predictions regarding the mechanisms, scope, and temporal dynamics of these effects. This large-scale randomized controlled trial tested predications from three influential stress-effect models using a broad cognitive task battery embedded within a psychopharmacological stress paradigm. Across 606 testing sessions, 303 healthy male participants completed both the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST) and its non-stress control condition. To independently manipulate acute stress and stress hormone availability, participants were additionally randomized to receive atomoxetine (40 mg; to prolong norepinephrine availability), hydrocortisone (10 mg; to increase cortisol availability), or placebo. Cognitive performance was assessed over 80-minutes (post-stress) using tasks targeting visual perception (rapid serial visual presentation), response inhibition (stop-signal), and cognitive flexibility (dual and switch tasks). MAST exposure selectively impaired response inhibition, reflected in shorter stop-signal delays, lower probabilities of successful stopping and prolonged stop-signal reaction times, particularly during later testing phases (40-80 minutes post-stress). MAST exposure did not affect visual perception or task-switching performance but buffered time-related declines in processing efficiency at the expense of task prioritization in the dual task. Pharmacological manipulation of norepinephrine or cortisol availability was effective but did not moderate cognitive stress effects. Overall, this pattern of task-specific impairment alongside stabilized processing efficiency cannot be fully explained by any tested model, highlighting the need to refine existing models and adopt more integrative approaches to advance our mechanistic understanding of cognitive stress-effects in laboratory and real-world contexts.",

      "title": "Convex Efficient Coding",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10482v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Why do neurons encode information the way they do? Normative answers to this question model neural activity as the solution to an optimisation problem; for example, the celebrated efficient coding hypothesis frames neural activity as the optimal encoding of information under efficiency constraints. Successful normative theories have varied dramatically in complexity, from simple linear models (Atick & Redlich '90), to complex deep neural networks (Lindsay '21). What complex models gain in flexibility, they lose in tractability and often understandability. Here, we split the difference by constructing a set of tractable but flexible normative representational theories. Instead of optimising the neural activities directly, following Sengupta et al. '18, we optimise the representational similarity, a matrix formed from the dot products of each pair of neural responses. Using this, we show that a large family of interesting optimisation problems are convex. This family includes problems corresponding to linear and some non-linear neural networks, and problems from the literature not previously recognised as convex, such as modified versions of semi-nonnegative matrix factorisation or nonnegative sparse coding. We put these findings to work in three ways. First, we provide the first necessary and sufficient identifiability result for a form of semi-nonnegative matrix factorisation. Second, we show that if neural tunings are `different enough' then they are uniquely linked to the optimal representational similarity, partially justifying the use of single neuron tuning analysis in neuroscience. Finally, we use the tractable nonlinearity of some of our problems to explain why dense retinal codes, but not sparse cortical codes, optimally split the coding of a single variable into ON & OFF channels. In sum, we identify a space of convex problems, and use them to derive neural coding results.",

      "title": "Reshaping Neural Representation via Associative, Presynaptic Short-Term Plasticity",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10397v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) is traditionally viewed as a purely presynaptic filter of incoming spike trains, independent of postsynaptic activity. Recent experiments, however, reveal an associative form of STP in which presynaptic release probability changes alongside long-term potentiation, implying a richer computational role for presynaptic plasticity. Here we develop a normative theory of associative STP using an information-theoretic framework. Extending Fisher-information-based learning to Tsodyks-Markram synapses, we derive analytic update rules for baseline synaptic strength and release probability that maximize encoded stimulus information under resource constraints. The learning rules separate into a conventional postsynaptic term tracking local firing and a distinct presynaptic term with a phase-advanced structure that selectively detects stimulus onset; critically, differences between plasticity of baseline strength and release probability arise within this presynaptic component. For stimulus variations slower than the EPSP time constant, onset sensitivity biases optimal connectivity toward anti-causal associations, strengthening synapses from neurons activated later to those activated earlier. In recurrent circuits, these rules yield ramp-like sustained representations and reverse replay after drive removal. Linear-response analysis further shows that STP confers frequency-dependent phase selectivity on presynaptic drive and that constraints on total release probability systematically tune temporal asymmetry. Together, our results provide a principled account of associative STP and identify presynaptic plasticity of release probability as a substrate for rapidly reconfigurable temporal coding.",

      "title": "How Intrinsic Motivation Underlies Embodied Open-Ended Behavior",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.10276v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Although most theories posit that natural behavior can be explained as maximizing some form of extrinsic reward, often called utility, some behaviors appear to be reward independent. For instance, spontaneous motor babbling in human newborns and curiosity in little kids and other animals seem to elude a simple explanation in terms of extrinsic reward maximization. Rooted in these observations, intrinsic motivation has emerged as a potentially major driver of behavior. However, only recently have several quantitative and foundational theories of intrinsic motivation been put forward. We first provide a general framework to understand behavior as being organized hierarchically: objective--intrinsic reward, or motivation--drives, goals and extrinsic reward. We next review the main formalizations of intrinsic motivation, including empowerment, the free energy principle, information-gain maximization, and the maximum occupancy principle. These theories produce complex behavior by promoting, in various ways, entropic action-state paths. The presence of a single intrinsic motivation objective breaks infinite regress, as drives and goals act only temporarily to serve the objective. Extrinsic rewards, such as sugar or protein, are just a means to achieve the objective. Bounded cognition and embodiment impose constraints and boundary conditions for the intrinsic motivation objective. By virtue of their capability to generate complex behavior in a task-agnostic manner, theories of intrinsic motivation promise to become successful generative models of open-ended, embodied behavior.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.10221v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Learning, inference, and emergence in biological and artificial systems are often studied within disparate theoretical frameworks, ranging from energy-based models to recurrent and attention-based architectures. Here we develop a unified dynamical field theory in which learning and inference are governed by a minimal stochastic dynamical equation admitting a Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--de Dominicis formulation. Within this framework, inference corresponds to saddle-point trajectories of the associated action, while fluctuation-induced loop corrections render collective modes dynamically emergent and generate nontrivial dynamical time scales. A central result of this work is that cognitive function is controlled not by microscopic units or precise activity patterns, but by the collective organization of dynamical time scales. We introduce the \\emph{time-scale density of states} (TDOS) as a compact diagnostic that characterizes the distribution of collective relaxation modes governing inference dynamics. Learning and homeostatic regulation are naturally interpreted as processes that reshape the TDOS, selectively generating slow collective modes that support stable inference, memory, and context-dependent computation despite stochasticity and structural irregularity. This framework unifies energy-based models, recurrent neural networks, transformer architectures, and biologically motivated homeostatic dynamics within a single physical description, and provides a principled route toward understanding cognition as an emergent dynamical phenomenon.",
