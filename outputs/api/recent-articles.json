      "title": "A study on the dreams of Miao and Han college students in Guizhou Province.",
      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "content": "Animals must integrate sensory information, ignore behaviorally irrelevant stimuli, and respond to behaviorally relevant stimuli to find food, find mates, avoid predators, and ultimately survive. In mammals, these goal-directed behaviors require the coordinated activity of many brain regions, including sensory and prefrontal cortices as well as neuromodulatory brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus (LC), which is the brain's primary source of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine resulting from LC activity and arousal indexed by pupil size exert strong influences on goal-directed behavior. We explored the relationships between pupil size, cortical noradrenergic dynamics, and behavior in a tactile signal detection task. We monitored pupil dynamics and fluorescent GRAB_NE signals in somatosensory and prefrontal cortices simultaneously during task execution and found that pupil size and synchronization of GRAB_NE signals at baseline were strong predictors of whether animals chose to respond but not baseline cortical GRABNE levels. We also employed a generalized linear model - hidden Markov model (GLM-HMM) framework to identify distinct, stable behavioral states throughout the task that optimally account for task performance. We found distinct psychometric curves, task-evoked pupil dynamics, and cortical NE dynamics across these behavioral states.",

TimeTracer is my attempt to combine record/replay with a practical debugging workflow (API + DB/cache calls) and a lightweight dashboard/timeline that helps you inspect what happened during a request.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s New in v1.3 / v1.4</strong></p> <p>- Django support (Django 3.2+ and 4.x, supports both sync + async views)</p> <p>- pytest integration (zero-config fixture like timetracer_replay to replay cassettes inside tests)</p> <p>- aiohttp support (now supports httpx, requests, and aiohttp)</p> <p>- Dashboard + timeline improvements for faster debugging</p> <p><strong>Install:</strong> pip install timetracer</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/usv240/timetracer\">https://github.com/usv240/timetracer</a></p> <p>Previous post (original launch)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qflvmi/i_built_timetracer_recordreplay_api_calls_locally/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qflvmi/i_built_timetracer_recordreplay_api_calls_locally/</a></p> <p>Contributions welcome, if anyone is interested in helping (features, tests, docs, or new integrations), I\u2019d love the support.</p> <p><strong>Looking for feedback:</strong></p> <p>If you use Django/pytest, does this workflow make sense?

      "title": "Levels of shared autonomy in brain-robot interfaces: enabling multi-robot multi-human collaboration for activities of daily living",
      "content": "Individuals with ALS and other severe motor impairments often rely on caregivers for daily tasks, which limits their independence and sense of control. Brain-robot interfaces (BRIs) have the potential to restore autonomy, but many existing systems are task-specific and highly automated, which reduces the users' sense of empowerment and limits opportunities to exercise autonomy. In particular, shared autonomy approaches hold promise for overcoming current BRI limitations, by balancing user control with increased robot capabilities. In this work, we introduce a collaborative BRI that integrates non-invasive EEG, EMG, and eye tracking to enable multi-user, multi-robot interaction in a shared kitchen environment with mobile manipulators. Our system modulates assistance through three levels of autonomy\u2014Assisted Teleoperation, Shared Autonomy, and Full Automation\u2014allowing users to retain meaningful control over task execution while reducing effort for routine operations. We conducted a controlled user study comparing autonomy conditions, evaluating performance, workload, ease of use, and agency. Our results show that, while Full Automation was generally preferred by users due to lower workload and higher usability, Shared Autonomy provided higher reliability and preserved user agency, especially in the presence of noisy EEG decoding. Although there was significant individual variability in EEG decoding performance, our post-hoc analysis revealed the potential benefits of customizing pipelines for each user. Finally, we note that our findings are specific to the multi-modal configuration tested and should not be interpreted as a universal claim about the superiority of any autonomy level, and, furthermore, our user study was limited by the use of healthy adults rather than target population (e.g., individuals with ALS), gender imbalance, and a relatively small sample size, which may affect generalizability.
