      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Looking at a new position, with a mission I do care about, but just got their take-home assignment and I am having some 2nd thoughts. I'm mostly a low-level engineer, HPC modeling and simulation and signal processing and the employer knows this. And this sort of thing isn't as the position was described.</p> <p>I assume this is their standard question, regardless of the candidate: </p> <hr /> <p>Please write code to download the current dataset, store the data server-side, create APIs that can retrieve the server-side stored data, and provide a UI to analyze it for items such as word count per department, historical changes over time, and a checksum for each department.</p> <p>Only implement analysis that would provide meaningful information to the user.</p> <p>Please add at least one custom metric that you believe may help inform decisions more effectively.</p> <hr /> <p>Without environment setup, they designed this to take under 6 hours. I can see it taking that long for someone who does this sort of thing every day currently, but with my background, this is completely different. </p> <p>Just looking to see if I am off-base in my assessment that this is way more than 6 hours of work or if they simply expect me to shove it into an LLM and go from there. Which is probably what I am going to do, since I need to learn a lot of new tech to do it regardless.</p> <p>--edit--</p> <p>Thanks for the feedback. Definitely feels like a lot and my inner cynic definitely leans towards them trying to take advantage of some free work. That being said, it's a company and gig I'd really like to land, so probably going to take a stab at it. Definitely going to use some LLMs to get the ball rolling, since I never used Django. My experience is almost all low-level C/C++ dev, so this is a new path for me (and one that I want to undertake). Going to probably put some mornings into it. </p> <p>First: Getting a good dev environment set up for it and getting the ingestion pipeline work with it. Will most likely just use sqlLite for the quick backend. It's ingesting most json documents, so I don't think I am going to have to do a bunch of data modeling (especially for a quick project - will make notes for the following interview discussions though).</p> <p>Morning 2: Get the personal apis up and running and maybe start a very barebones UI for it (I hate doing UI work - doing it daily got me to leave a former job).</p> <p>Morning 3: Do a bit of clean up and maybe some new metric to put in.</p> <p>I dislike using LLMs for generating code - so not thrilled about it - I know there will be massive holes in my understanding - but worst case, it will be an interesting learning experience for it. </p> <p>Thanks again for all the feedback, really appreciate it. Any further advice is appreciated as well - what type of stumbling blocks am I likely to run into, things to watch out for, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_Nomadic__\"> /u/_Nomadic__ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p2wgpx/looking_for_a_sanity_check_on_an_interview/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p2wgpx/looking_for_a_sanity_check_on_an_interview/\">[comments]</a></span>",
