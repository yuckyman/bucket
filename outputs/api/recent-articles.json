      "title": "The Virtual Brain Ontology: A Digital Knowledge Framework for Reproducible Brain Network Modeling",
      "content": "Computational models of brain network dynamics offer mechanistic insights into brain function and disease, and are utilized for hypothesis generation, data interpretation, and the creation of personalized digital brain twins. However, results remain difficult to reproduce and compare because equations, parameters, networks, and numerical settings are reported inconsistently across the literature, and shared code is often not fully documented, standardized, or executable. We introduce *The Virtual Brain Ontology* (TVB-O), a semantic knowledge base, minimal metadata standard, and Python toolbox that simplifies the description, execution, and sharing of network simulations. TVB-O offers 1) a common vocabulary and ontology for core concepts and axioms representing current domain knowledge for simulating brain network dynamics, 2) a minimal, human- and machine-readable metadata specification for the information needed to reproduce an experiment, 3) a curated database of published models, brain networks, and study configurations, and 4) software that generates executable code for various simulation platforms and programming languages, including The Virtual Brain, Jax, or Julia. FAIR metadata and provenance-aware reports can be exported from TVB-O's model specification. It hereby enables a flexible framework for adopting new models and enhances reproducibility, comparability, and portability across simulators, while making assumptions explicit and linking models to biomedical knowledge and observation pathways. By reducing technical barriers and standardizing workflows, TVB-O broadens access to computational neuroscience and establishes a foundation for transparent, shareable \"digital brain twins\" that integrate with clinical pipelines and large-scale data resources.",

      "title": "Independent Basal Ganglia Neural Populations Encode Speech Production and Ambient-Noise Levels",
      "content": "The function of the basal ganglia (BG), a set of nuclei deep in the brain, is still under debate despite their clinical relevance. Lines of evidence from non-human primate and human experiments suggest that one key causal contribution of the adult primate BG is invigoration of movement according to environmental and energetic constraints. Previous studies have come to this conclusion using primarily limb motor control tasks. We hypothesized BG are also important for invigorating the respiratory, vocal, and articulatory motor systems during speech production. To test this, we used a rare clinical opportunity to record local field potentials-broadband gamma activity (LFP-BGA) and single unit (SU) activity from human basal ganglia during deep brain stimulation implant surgeries. Participants repeated sentences aloud in the operating room. We modulated environmental and energetic constraints of speech production by inducing the Lombard Effect, wherein people reliably increase the intensity of their voice in the presence of background noise. Participants increased voice intensity, pitch, vowel space size, and respiratory depth in the presence of ambient noise. ~40% of LFP and SU sites were modulated by speech production. Comparing globus pallidus (GP) LFP-BGA, herein reported for the first time during speech, to subthalamic nucleus (STN) LFP-BGA revealed GP activated after STN. STN was more coincident with the speech preparatory period and GP more coincident with speech onset, suggesting differential roles in speech production. We found only weak evidence that STN or GP activity encodes the level of produced speech intensity. Instead, we found that LFP-BGA and SU-FR robustly track the ambient background noise levels. Linear decoding from SU-firing rate revealed we could infer the background noise levels with >75% accuracy in any given time point in the trial, including baseline. Importantly, the ambient-noise-modulated sites were an independent population from speech-modulated sites. We conclude that human BG encode the energetic constraints of communication. We theorize that the code is leveraged in downstream BG-cortical loop nodes to invigorate speech oro-motor gestures and co-speech manual limb gestures, both of which respond to ambient noise levels to maintain high-fidelity communication.",

      "title": "Identity Domains Reveal How Life Experiences and the Microbiome Shape Individuality and Uncover the Presence of Social Memory in Drosophila",
      "content": "Personality is comprised of enduring traits that shape behavior across contexts and over time. Yet outside humans, research often equates individuality with personality, focusing on how one animal differs from another in each behavior. This overlooks the latent space that spans an animal's behavioral repertoire, how it is shaped by innate tendencies and prior experiences, and how it differs from transient factors. Here, we bridge this gap by integrating a data-driven framework with unbiased trait interpretation via large language models, revealing how social, sexual, and physiological conditions systematically alter the expression of personality-like traits in Drosophila melanogaster. This approach yielded four identities: space-use (exploration), time-use (social investment), avoidance, and aggression. Large language models produced strong consensus on the interpretation of some of these axes and divergence on others. These dimensions proved stable within individuals yet shifted predictably following mating, isolation, and microbiome manipulation, often in sex dependent ways. Notably, flies behaved differently toward familiar and unfamiliar peers, revealing a capacity for social memory. These findings bridge temperament and personality, showing how life history reshapes baseline tendencies into individualized profiles within constrained dimensions. They establish Drosophila as a tractable system for uncovering the biological logic of personality and advancing cross-species principles for individuality research.",

      "title": "A novel method to sort and enrich sensory neurons",
      "content": "Peripheral sensory neurons, residing in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), relay sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Although single-cell transcriptomic studies have identified over 20 distinct sensory neuron subtypes, functional analysis and assessment of subtype-specific pathological changes remain difficult. Effective isolation and enrichment of sensory neurons are challenging yet essential for functional studies. Therefore, we used single-cell transcriptomic data from DRG to identify a panel of neuronal surface markers, including Nrxn2 and Pirt. Using these markers, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) panel for neuronal enrichment and analysis that does not rely on transgenic mouse strains and can be broadly applied. The panel was validated by microscopy and single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing, which also revealed broad representation of neuronal subtypes. Expression of these markers in human DRG underscores the translational value of this isolation method for sensory and pain studies. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for isolating DRG neurons, advancing research on sensory neuron function and pain biology, and facilitating neuroimmune studies.",

      "title": "Immature C. elegans motor neurons control early embryo behavior via both synaptic and non-synaptic GABA release",
      "content": "Pre-natal brain activity has long lasting effects on subsequent neurodevelopment. It is unclear if early brain activity is dominated by cell intrinsic, synaptic, or non-synaptic mechanisms. We address this question by analyzing C. elegans embryo behavior in snf-11 mutants, which lack a plasma membrane GABA re-uptake pump (orthologous to GAT1). At 510-570 minutes post-fertilization, embryo motion was transiently and potently inhibited in snf-11 GAT1 mutants, which precedes formation of most nerve ring synapses. This transient motion inhibition requires GABA synthesis in DD motor neurons and UNC-49 GABAA receptors in body muscles. When motion inhibition occurs, DD neurons have not yet completed neurite outgrowth. Genetic analysis suggests that motion inhibition was mediated by both synaptic and tonic GABA release from DD motor neurons. These results suggest that DD neurons control embryo behavior prior to completing their developmental maturation.",

      "title": "Convergent and divergent spatial topographies of individualized brain functional networks and their developmental origins",
      "content": "The human brain is intrinsically organized into canonical functional networks with distinct spatial topographies. While precision functional mapping delineates individualized topographies of single networks, the spatial coordination among networks and its developmental origin remains largely unknown. Here, we propose functional topography covariance analysis (FOCA), a novel framework that quantifies convergent and divergent spatial alignments across individualized functional networks and further delineates their internetwork relationships, neurobiological basis, ontogenetic layouts, and cognitive outcomes. Across two well-established task-free functional MRI (fMRI) datasets encompassing both conventional and densely sampled scans, FOCA consistently revealed self-clustered hierarchies in the coordination of functional topographies, closely aligned with existing functional gradients and characterized by convergent couplings within primary systems and divergent couplings in higher-order systems. Such pattern was well predicted by fundamental neurobiological attributes, especially aerobic glycolysis. In a large public neonatal cohort, FOCA matrix exhibited adult-inverted hierarchical couplings and marked changes in auditory and action-mode networks, primarily driven by prominent redistributions of negative couplings. Moreover, neonatal FOCA profiles in the primary visual system significantly predicted neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months. Finally, compared with conventional functional connectivity (FC), FOCA proved more robust to global signals and more sensitive to the maturation of negative couplings. These findings highlight the critical role of negative connectivity in brain functional reorganization and advance our understanding of the cooperative and competitive relationships among functional systems and their developmental origins.",
