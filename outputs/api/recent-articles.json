      "title": "AI-assisted MRI segmentation analysis of brain region volume alterations in Parkinson\u2019s disease",
      "content": "ObjectivesBy employing deep learning-based automatic whole-brain region segmentation technology, we aim to investigate the cross-sectional associations between regional brain volumes and disease duration in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).MethodsA retrospective study design was implemented on 83 patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD who had complete clinical and imaging data. Cranial magnetic resonance images (MRI) were imported into the uAI platform for automated regional segmentation of brain tissue. Volumetric data from five major brain regions and 80 subregions were extracted to explore their potential associations with disease progression in PD patients. Statistical analysis was conducted using a multiple linear regression model within the framework of linear regression analysis, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05.ResultsCross-sectional analysis revealed that in PD patients, volume ratios of multiple brain regions\u2014including the bilateral precentral gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, bilateral superior and inferior parietal lobules, bilateral precuneus, right cuneus, right lingual gyrus, bilateral lateral occipital gyrus, and right globus pallidus\u2014were negatively associated with disease duration (p < 0.05). In contrast, the right hippocampus, right inferior temporal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus showed positive correlations (p < 0.05). The combined volume ratios of these brain regions also decreased with longer disease duration (p < 0.05). Furthermore, absolute volume differences in the hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, isthmus of the cingulate gyrus, and cerebellar white matter increased as the disease progressed (p < 0.05).ConclusionIn PD patients, volume ratios and absolute volume differences in specific brain subregions associated with lateralized intracranial changes may serve as potential biomarkers for assessing brain tissue alterations during disease progression.",

      "title": "Supporting autistic adults with complex communication needs in making their voices heard: examining an adaptation of the Autism Voices framework",
      "content": "IntroductionAutistic adults with speech, language and/or cognitive challenges are often excluded from research, particularly from studies examining first-person perspectives, as these generally require that participants have strong speech, language, and cognitive skills. The current pilot study extends previous work and examines whether the Autism Voices framework can be adapted for use with a pre-existing interview the Camberwell Assessment of Need for Adults with Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities-Research version (CANDID-R).MethodsEleven young autistic adults with complex communication needs completed the CANDID-R interview using visual supports. These visual supports were provided to assist participants\u2019 comprehension of interview questions and to support them in answering the interview questions. Participants\u2019 caregivers also completed the interview and their answers to specific validation questions were compared to those of their adult children. Additionally, behavioral observations were also completed.ResultsThe findings from this pilot study indicate that our adaptation of the Autism Voices framework was, at least partially successful in supporting participants in answering the interview questions. Additionally, behavioral observations indicate that the visual supports helped participants remain engaged throughout the interview. However, results also indicate that further adaptations, which we discuss, will be required.ConclusionAutistic people with complex communication needs must be included in research about the lived experiences of autistic people. Building on previous work, we show that, with dedication and imagination, equitable and inclusive research is possible.",

      "title": "Cross-modal neuroplasticity in partial hearing loss: a mini-review",
      "content": "Sensory loss induces adaptive neural changes in the remaining non-deprived senses, known as cross-modal plasticity. Recent proposals of cross-modal plasticity suggest that it is a top-down, dynamic phenomenon that can occur through the lifespan and is initiated whether sensory loss is total (as in blindness or deafness) or more subtle (mild-to-moderate partial sensory loss). However, it is unclear whether adaptive plasticity differs between total and partial loss, because there is less research on the latter condition. Here we reviewed neuroimaging research on cross-modal plasticity in adult humans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss and compared it to three claims derived from deafness research. First, cross-modal plasticity is thought to involve both intra-modal strengthening of remaining senses and cross-modal recruitment of deprived cortical areas, but we were unable to identify strong evidence of cross-modal recruitment in adults with partial hearing loss. Second, cross-modal plasticity is believed to arise through top-down connections and implicates cognitive function, which agreed with our findings. Third, cross-modal plasticity is believed to enhance perception in the non-deprived senses. No study in our review supported this claim, but it is possible that cross-modal plasticity in partial hearing loss results in stronger modulation of auditory function by intact senses. In addition, many study outcomes in humans with partial loss were inconsistent. Overall, it may be premature to conclude that cross-modal plasticity operates the same for partial and total forms of sensory loss in humans, and we provide several recommendations for testing these claims in future research.",

      "title": "Review of deep learning models with Spiking Neural Networks for modeling and analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data",
      "content": "Medical imaging has become an essential tool for identifying and treating neurological conditions. Traditional deep learning (DL) models have made tremendous advances in neuroimaging analysis; however, they face difficulties when modeling complicated spatiotemporal brain data. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which are inspired by real neurons, provide a promising option for efficiently processing spatiotemporal data. This review discusses current improvements in using SNNs for multimodal neuroimaging analysis. Quantitative and thematic analyses were conducted on 21 selected publications to assess trends, research topics, and geographical contributions. Results show that SNNs outperform traditional DL approaches in classification, feature extraction, and prediction tasks, especially when combining multiple modalities. Despite their potential, challenges of multimodal data fusion, computational demands, and limited large-scale datasets persist. We discussed the growth of SNNs in analysis, prediction, and diagnosis of neurological data, along with the emphasis on future direction and improvements for more efficient and clinically applicable models.",

      "title": "Influence of context on extinguished appetitive conditioning in male and female rats.",
      "content": "Extinction is fundamental to adaptive behavior in that it allows organisms to alter previously conditioned behaviors based on the prevailing environmental contingencies. Extinguished responses, however, will renew when the conditioned stimulus is presented outside the extinction context. There has been some suggestion that renewal after extinction of appetitive conditioning is a sex-specific process, with only male rats showing renewal (e.g., Anderson & Petrovich, 2015, 2017, 2018). The purpose of the present experiments was to revisit the role of sex in appetitive renewal, in part because an earlier literature demonstrated renewal in experiments with only female rats (e.g., Brooks & Bouton, 1994). In three experiments, rats underwent appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in Context A, followed by extinction in Context B, and then within-subject renewal testing in both B and A. In Experiment 1a, renewal was present for both male and female rats. In Experiment 1b, the procedure included exposures to Context A during the extinction phase. Once again, renewal was observed in female rats. In Experiment 2, we assessed if cycling hormones contribute to renewal in female rats. To do so we compared intact female rats with ovariectomized female rats, and observed robust renewal in both groups. Our results support the notion that renewal is a general behavioral phenomenon, and is one reason why behavior change may be difficult to sustain (Bouton, 2014).

      "title": "Gonadectomy maintains goal-directed responding in female rats and accelerates habit formation in male rats.",
      "content": "We have previously demonstrated that gonadally intact female rats become habitual following around 120 response\u2013outcome (R-Os) exposures during operant training. This rapid development of habit does not occur in gonadally intact male rats, which remain goal-directed up to at least 320 R-Os. The present study sought to examine the effect of removing gonadal hormones on the acquisition and expression of goal-directed and habitual behaviors separately in both male and female rats. To accomplish this, separate experimental groups of adult Long-Evans rats were utilized, including intact and ovariectomized (OVX) females, as well as intact and castrated (CAST) males. All groups were trained to 240 R-Os, and one half of each experimental group was subjected to a reinforcer devaluation procedure, while the remaining half served as nondevalued controls. An extinction test was then used to determine habitual versus goal-directed behavior. Results found intact females trained to 240 R-Os showed habit and intact males trained to 240 R-Os showed goal-directed behavior. Results also found that ovariectomy disrupts habit in female rats, keeping them goal-directed at 240 R-Os, while castration in male rats produced habitual responding at 240 R-Os, thus effectively reversing the sex differences observed in intact rats at 240 R-Os. An additional experiment was done in OVX and CAST males trained to 160 R-Os to determine if gonadectomy altered goal/habit behavior earlier in instrumental learning. Results showed that both OVX females and CAST males were goal-directed at 160 R-Os. Overall, these results indicate the lack of ovarian hormones effectively delays habit in female rats, and lack of testicular hormones produces earlier habit in males.

      "title": "Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.10467v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.",

      "title": "Navigating the Ethics of Internet Measurement: Researchers' Perspectives from a Case Study in the EU",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.10408v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Internet measurement research is essential for understanding, improving, and securing Internet infrastructure. However, its methods often involve large-scale data collection and user observation, raising complex ethical questions. While recent research has identified ethical challenges in Internet measurement research and laid out best practices, little is known about how researchers actually make ethical decisions in their research practice. To understand how these practices take shape day-to-day from the perspective of Internet measurement researchers, we interviewed 16 researchers from an Internet measurement research group in the EU. Through thematic analysis, we find that researchers deal with five main ethical challenges: privacy and consent issues, the possibility of unintended harm, balancing transparency with security and accountability, uncertain ethical boundaries, and hurdles in the ethics review process. Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research. We also highlight the invisible labor of Internet measurement researchers and describe their ethics practices as craft knowledge, both of which are crucial in upholding responsible research practices in the Internet measurement community.",

      "title": "Moral Change or Noise? On Problems of Aligning AI With Temporally Unstable Human Feedback",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.10032v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Alignment methods in moral domains seek to elicit moral preferences of human stakeholders and incorporate them into AI. This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for \"legitimate\" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting \"response instability\"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing \"model instability\"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training. These findings raise fundamental normative and technical challenges relevant to AI alignment, highlighting the need to better understand the object of alignment (what to align to) when user preferences change significantly over time.",
