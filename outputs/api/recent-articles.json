      "title": "Model-based separation of visual and oculomotor signals in marmoset lateral intraparietal area",
      "content": "The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) integrates visual information with task demands to guide saccadic eye movements. Most prior studies have relied on imposed prolonged delays to separate sensory and motor activity, whereas natural behavior involves rapid sensory-motor transformations. To examine LIP function during more naturalistic oculomotor behavior, we recorded multi-unit activity from LIP in two marmosets performing a task requiring rapid selection of salient visual stimuli. Because sensory and motor signals temporally overlap in such fast tasks, we used a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that separately captured visually driven and oculomotor-related components. The model explained substantial neural variance during correct and missed saccades, as well as spontaneous eye movements, and revealed heterogeneous sensory and motor encoding across recorded neural units. Our approach demonstrated that the origins of neural activity can be segregated without relying on imposed delays, and showed the presence of a strong post-saccadic motor signal in LIP.",

      "title": "Advancing High-Resolution 7T Diffusion MRI: Evaluating Phase-Encoding Correction Strategies for Distortion Correction from Basic to Four-Way Acquisitions",
      "content": "Purpose: High-resolution 7T diffusion MRI (dMRI) is limited by image artifacts that compromise anatomical accuracy. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate phase-encoding (PE) acquisition and correction strategies to determine which methods best mitigate geometric distortions and improve data reproducibility. Methods: Five healthy adults were each scanned twice on a 7T MRI scanner (0.9 mm isotropic resolution), using a highly oversampled dMRI protocol with four PE directions (AP, PA, RL, LR). From this dataset, we created and processed eleven time-equivalent, 10-minute acquisitions, ranging from uncorrected single-PE data to comprehensive 4-way PE schemes. These strategies were quantitatively compared on their geometric alignment with T1-weighted images and on the scan-rescan reproducibility of DTI-derived metrics. Results: (1) All distortion-corrected schemes significantly improved geometric accuracy over uncorrected data; (2) Strategies correcting with a full set of reversed-PE (2-way) diffusion weighted images (DWIs) outperformed the common approach of using only a single reversed b=0 image; and (3) a 4-way PE acquisition consistently provided the highest image fidelity and reproducibility. The optimized acquisition enabled high-quality reconstruction of both long-range and fine-scale superficial white matter pathways. Conclusion: For high-resolution 7T dMRI, multi-PE acquisition is essential to achieve accurate geometry and stable microstructural estimates (i.e., less residual EPI distortion and better scan-rescan agreement). A 4-way PE scheme provides the most accurate and reproducible results for microstructural and connectivity modeling. Data statement: Data will be made available in BIDS format in openneuro sharing platform upon acceptance of the manuscript. To be updated with DOI.",

      "title": "Anterior thalamic nucleus inputs to the retrosplenial cortex are unperturbed in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive function. Although research has traditionally focused on the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, other regions important for memory and spatial navigation, such as the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), are also affected. The RSC is an important brain region for both memory and spatial navigation, and displays dysfunction in humans during prodromal phases of AD. The ATN provide a major input to RSC, with loss of this input to RSC causing a dramatic reduction in the expression of the immediate early gene product c-Fos. The ATN to RSC connection may thus present a new target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Here, we set out to determine whether AD-like pathology perturbed projections from ATN to RSC using the hAPP-J20 amyloidopathy mouse model, using optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs combined with ex vivo patch clamp electrophysiology. We found that RSC displayed an age-dependent decline in basal c-Fos activity, with no additional effect of amyloid pathology on c-Fos expression. At all time points (3, 6 and 9 months) measured, we found no evidence of impairments in the synaptic strength or efficacy of the ATN projections to either granular or dysgranular subdivisions of RSC. We conclude that, in the hAPP-J20 mouse model, this pathway is unaffected by amyloid-{beta} overexpression.",

      "title": "Molecular dynamics of the pathogenic KCNQ2 variant G256W reveal mechanisms of channel dysfunction in epileptic encephalopathy",
      "content": "Brain voltage-gated potassium channels containing the subunit KCNQ2 are essential for regulating electrical signals contributing to sensation, learning, memory, and motor control. De novo KCNQ2 variants are among the more common Mendelian causes of early life epilepsy and neurodevelopmental impairment. Some patients with KCNQ2 variants are affected with KCNQ2 developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (KCNQ2 DEE) characterized by seizures and developmental delays. Children with KCNQ2 DEE exhibit a range of impairment patterns that appear to be correlated with specific consequences of the variant for protein function. Here, we used all-atom molecular dynamics to analyze a pathogenic missense variant KCNQ2 G256W, located in the pore turret. G256W subunit simulations showed migration of the hydrophobic W256 sidechain towards the lipid membrane. This movement affected turret structure and mobility prominently involving K255. We identified novel hydrogen bonding interactions in the wild type KCNQ2 turret region which formed a network that extended to the selectivity filter and identified N258, H260P, and K283 as key residues. Simulations comparing WT and G256W tetrameric channels exhibited more conformationally unstable ion selectivity filters for G256W. We analyzed how different stoichiometries of wild type and G256W subunits, as expected in heterozygous individuals, impacted dynamics and compared the G256W results to three additional variants of the turret-selectivity filter network. Our results provide additional support for an integral role of the KCNQ2 turret selectivity filter stability. The majority of severe KCNQ2 DEE variants are clustered near the selectivity filter in the pore domain. Our study provides insights that may be broadly applicable to this clinically important allele subgroup.",

      "title": "Human Mediodorsal Thalamus in Seizure Propagation",
      "content": "Background: How different thalamic sites are recruited during seizure propagation remains poorly understood. Simultaneous recordings from multiple thalamic sites in patients with focal seizures provide a rare opportunity to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of thalamic involvement during human epilepsy. Objective: To characterize the recruitment patterns of mediodorsal (MD) thalamic subregion during seizures and their generalization to the contralateral hemisphere. Methods: We analyzed 119 seizures from 23 patients (12 male, age range: 20-57y) undergoing multisite thalamic recordings. In accordance with current clinical standards, we determined the spatial and temporal features of thalamic seizure activity by visually reviewing intracranial EEG recordings from different seizure types in each individual patient. Results: The procedure of multisite thalamic recordings had no complications. In total, we captured seizures originating from temporal lobes (63%), orbitofrontal (11%), frontotemporal (8%), occipital (8%), lateral frontal (4%), parietal (3%), and cingulate (2%) regions. Seizures were focal (76% in 21 patients), focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC, 9% in nine patients), or only electrographic (15% in six patients). Thalamic engagement was seen in 100% of patients occurring typically early during seizure evolution (83% within 15 seconds of seizure onset). Majority of FBTC seizures (73%) had faster thalamic recruitment, often within the first 5 seconds. The pulvinar (PLV) subregion was the most common first-activated thalamic site, particularly in temporal lobe seizures. Although the MD was involved in most seizures (88.2%), it was rarely the initial or sole thalamic structure engaged and more often followed anterior (ANT) and/or PLV sites. Contralateral propagation occurred in 66% of seizures and was strongly linked to MD involvement: the ipsilateral and contralateral MDs were engaged in about 95% of these cases. When ipsilateral MD engagement was absent, contralateral spread of seizures was uncommon. In majority of seizures (60%) that generalized to the contralateral hemisphere, the ipsilateral MD was involved before or simultaneously with the contralateral cortical sites. Importantly, seizures that first activated the MD originated mainly from the medial temporal lobes, whereas those spreading primarily to the contralateral cortex were mostly neocortical in onset. Conclusions: The thalamic MD subregion was often involved after the other thalamic sites, but the MD sites, along with the massa intermedia connecting the two thalami, were significantly involved when seizures spread to contralateral hemisphere. Our findings suggest that a single thalamic lead capturing both MD subregions may yield important clinical information about laterality, origin, and generalization of seizures.",

      "content": "The complexity of the brain is increasingly mirrored by the complexity of the neuroscientific literature, yet no individual mind can fully grasp the diversity of scales, methodologies and model organisms. Where human experts flag, the latest AI models excel: large language models can seamlessly integrate knowledge across scientific domains. Here we show how large language models can systematically and quantitatively synthesise literature-wide neuroscientific knowledge about the cognitive operations and dysfunctions associated with each brain region. Meta-analysis of AI experts reveals structurefunction mappings to which existing meta-analytic frameworks are blind, demonstrated by lesions and direct intracranial stimulation. It also unlocks the possibility of extending quantitative literature metaanalysis and decoding of brain maps to other model organisms beyond human. As proof of concept, we integrate LLM meta-analysis with species-specific transcriptomics in human, macaque, and mouse, to discover an evolutionarily conserved molecular circuit for cognition. Altogether, meta-analysis of AI experts can fundamentally catalyze neuroscientific discovery by overcoming the barrier of data aggregation from heterogeneous studies, finally bringing together a scattered literature to identify emergent patterns and latent insights across disparate subfields, modalities, and species.",

      "title": "GABA co-release guides the functional maturation of glycinergicsynapses in an auditory sound localization circuit.",
      "content": "In the mammalian brainstem and spinal cord, glycine is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter. However, during development, many glycinergic neurons also co-release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Although the acute effects of GABA co-release on immature synaptic transmission have been increasingly characterized, its role in synapse maturation and circuit formation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the developmental roles of GABA co-release at glycinergic synapses from the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) to the lateral superior olive (LSO), an auditory pathway essential for binaural integration and sound localization. During the first two postnatal weeks, MNTB-LSO synapses co-release GABA and undergo pronounced synaptic and circuit refinement. Using conditional knockout mice with severely diminished GABA co-release from MNTB neurons, we found that key aspects of circuit refinement, including synaptic silencing and strengthening, occurred normally. However, a disruption of GABA co-release resulted in significantly larger quantal amplitudes and a reduced readily releasable vesicle pool, impairing the high fidelity and temporal precision of synaptic transmission, which are essential for accurate binaural processing. These results reveal a critical developmental role for GABA co-release in shaping the functional synaptic architecture of glycinergic synapses involved in sound localization.",

      "title": "Top-down control of sustained attention by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)- locus coeruleus (LC) circuit during the rodent continuous performance task (rCPT)",
      "content": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in attention by exerting top-down control to allocate cognitive resources toward behaviorally relevant stimuli based on learned context and expectations. mPFC neurons project to multiple cortical and subcortical regions, including the locus coeruleus (LC), the brain's primary source of norepinephrine (NE). The mPFC also receives inputs from the LC, which release NE to modulate mPFC neuronal activity and downstream cellular signaling. While enhanced functional connectivity between the mPFC and LC in mice during sustained attention tasks suggest an important role for the mPFC-LC circuit, functional evidence directly implicating this circuit in attention is lacking. Here, we investigated the role of the mPFC-LC circuit in attention by comparing selective chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons that project to the LC (mPFC-LC projectors) to non-specific chemogenetic manipulation of mPFC neurons. Selective activation of mPFC-LC projectors in mice performing the rodent continuous performance test (rCPT), a translational sustained attention task, robustly improves attentional performance by enhancing discrimination while non-selective activation of mPFC neurons increases attentional performance by increasing responsiveness and impulsivity. Behavioral effects of mPFC-LC projector activation were mediated by recruitment of a microcircuit involving LC-NE neurons and glutamate and GABA peri-LC neurons. while effects of non-selective activation of mPFC neurons were mediated by engaging downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as the LC/peri-LC region.",

      "title": "Neonatal morphine and HIV synergy induce persistent neuroimmune and anxiety-related transcriptional states",
      "content": "Background: Early life opioid exposure can disrupt neurodevelopment and heighten vulnerability to anxiety and affective disorders, particularly in individuals with HIV. Methods: Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we profiled adolescent brains from wild-type and HIV1 transgenic (Tg26) mice exposed to morphine during postnatal days 2 to 7. Results: Morphine exposure in Tg26 mice resulted in a highly dysregulated microglial phenotype, characterized by the ectopic upregulation of genes encoding neuronpeptides (Avp, Hcrt, and Pmch), while simultaneously showing a reduction in both inflammatory and homeostatic markers (Map3k6, Lgals3, Ccl3). Microglia also showed enhanced expression of dynorphin (Pdyn) and {kappa}-opioid receptor (Oprk1) signaling modules implicated in dysphoria and stress-induced negative effects. Furthermore, transcriptomic mapping revealed cell-type-specific neuronal adaptations: cholinergic neurons upregulated genes linked to anxiety and arousal (Avp, Oxt), GABAergic neurons upregulated genes linked to condition and aversive behavior, whereas glutamatergic neurons enriched for transcripts associated with thigmotaxis and fear behaviors. Conclusions: Together, these findings demonstrate that brief neonatal morphine exposure in an HIV-inflamed milieu induces persistent, cell-type-specific neuroimmune and neurotransmitter reprogramming that engages the dynorphin KOR pathway and predisposes to anxiety- and aversion-related behaviors.",

      "title": "Dual-targeting snRNA gene therapy rescues STMN2 and UNC13A splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the selective deterioration of motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). A key driver of this pathogenesis is nuclear loss of ALS-associated protein TDP-43, leading to mis-splicing of TDP-43 targets including important neuronal genes STMN2 and UNC13A. Here, we have developed a gene therapy strategy for ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies, to correct mis-splicing of both STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons using small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) encoded from a single vector. We identified promoter sequence elements to increase therapeutic snRNA expression by 10-fold, then further optimized the expression cassette with combinatorial snRNA targeting to rescue multiple cryptic splicing targets. The engineered snRNAs restored normal pre-mRNA processing of both STMN2 and UNC13A transcripts despite TDP-43 loss of function, rescuing stathmin-2 protein levels in iPSC derived motor neurons, restoring their axonal regeneration capacity to wild-type levels. In addition, adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of the snRNAs to the murine central nervous system in the constitutive cryptic splicing model Stmn2Hum{Delta}GU fully restored cortical Stmn2 pre-mRNA processing, highlighting the utility of snRNAs as a therapeutic modality in vivo. Together, this study demonstrates that snRNAs are a promising and versatile therapeutic strategy for the simultaneous correction of multiple aberrant transcripts affected by cryptic splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies.",
