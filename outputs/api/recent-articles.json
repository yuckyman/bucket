      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "Object Ownership Processing in Peripersonal Space: An Electroencephalographic Study",
      "content": "A fundamental aspect of interacting with objects in the environment is the ability to distinguish between objects that can be directly acted upon in the peripersonal space (PPS) and those out of immediate reach in the extrapersonal space (EPS). Performing appropriate actions also requires integrating social conceptual information related to who owns a particular object. While prior research has demonstrated that spatial and social factors influence object processing, how these factors are integrated is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, the present study explored the neurophysiological correlates of object ownership processing when objects were located in either the PPS or EPS. Facing a virtual character, 28 participants estimated the reachability of self-owned or other-owned objects, placed at different distances. The analysis confirmed that self-owned objects are processed faster when located in PPS, and other-owned objects are processed faster when located in EPS. EEG signals analysis revealed that early ERP components, such as the N1 and anterior N2, were modulated solely by objects' spatial location. In contrast, later components, including the P3 and anterior N400, were influenced by object ownership, although depending on object's location in space. These results suggest an early perceptual prioritization of objects in the PPS and a prioritization of objects that engages the self at a postperceptual stage. Overall, the findings provide new insights into how objects are processed depending on their spatial and social properties, and confirm that virtual reality represents a promising tool to probe neural mechanisms supporting perception and action in social contexts.",

      "title": "Neural Signatures of Recollection Are Sensitive to Memory Quality and Specific Event Features",
      "content": "Episodic memories reflect a bound representation of multimodal features that can be recollected with varying levels of precision. Recent fMRI investigations have demonstrated that the precision and content of information retrieved from memory engage a network of posterior medial-temporal and parietal regions co-activated with the hippocampus. Yet, comparatively, little is known about how memory content and precision affect common neural signatures of memory captured by EEG, where recollection has been associated with changes in ERP and oscillatory measures of neural activity. Here, we used a multifeature paradigm previously reported [Cooper, R. A., & Ritchey, M. Cortico-hippocampal network connections support the multidimensional quality of episodic memory. eLife, 8, e45591, 2019] with continuous measures of memory, in conjunction with scalp EEG, to characterize the content and quality of information that drives ERP and oscillatory markers of episodic memory. A common signature of memory retrieval in the left posterior regions, called the late positive component, was sensitive to overall memory quality and also to precision of recollection for spatial features. The analysis of oscillatory markers during recollection revealed that alpha/beta desynchronization was modulated by overall memory quality and also by individual features in memory. Importantly, we found evidence of a relationship between these two neural markers of memory retrieval, suggesting that they may represent complementary aspects of the recollection experience. These findings demonstrate how time-sensitive and dynamic processes identified with EEG correspond to overall episodic recollection and also to the retrieval of precise features in memory.",

      "title": "Transient and Sustained Neuromagnetic Representation of Consonance and Dissonance in Harmonic Sequences",
      "content": "The perception of musical consonance/dissonance (C/D) relies on basic properties of the auditory system, and prior investigations have shown that C/D sounds elicit strongly divergent neurophysiological activity in human auditory cortex. However, studies are missing that assess transient (P1, N1, P2) and sustained cortical C/D representations within a harmonic context, together with the corresponding patterns of neural adaptation. The present magnetoencephalography experiment applied spatio-temporal source analysis to study the early transient and sustained neuromagnetic processing of C/D at the start and within brief harmonic sequences. A total of n = 40 adult listeners (among them numerous amateur musicians) participated in the experiment; the harmonic sequences comprised different blends of C/D dyads with balanced probabilities, in an effort to access simple C/D relations and neural adaptation at an early stage of the processing hierarchy. Consistent with earlier findings, the transient cortical activity was found to reflect vertical (i.e., absolute) C/D aspects in response to the sequence's first dyad, but it mirrored more horizontal aspects (i.e., C/D relations) at the subsequent dyad transitions; moreover, the neuromagnetic responses (particularly, the N1 and P2 waves) exhibited adaptation with different time constants, parts of which pertained to C/D-associated processing. Surprisingly, only few observations appeared to be influenced by the listener's musical expertise, likely due to the high overall level of musicality in our sample. In summary, our data indicate that early neuromagnetic activity reflects not only vertical, but also horizontal, aspects of C/D perception, together with corresponding adaptive mechanisms.",

      "title": "A mean-field model of neural networks with PV and SOM interneurons reveals connectivity-based mechanisms of gamma oscillations",
      "content": "Classic theoretical models of cortical oscillations are based on the interactions between two populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Nevertheless, experimental studies and network simulations suggest that interneuron subclasses such as parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) exert distinct control over oscillatory dynamics. Yet, we lack a theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying oscillations in E-PV-SOM circuits and of the differences with respect to the classical mechanisms for oscillations in simpler E-I networks. Here, we derive a biologically realistic mean-field model of a canonical three-population E-PV-SOM circuit. This model robustly generates oscillations whose features are consistent with experimental observations, including the relative timing of PV and SOM activity and the effects of optogenetic perturbations. By reducing the model to a linear analytical form, we demonstrate that gamma oscillations emerge directly from the cell-specific connectivity of the three-population circuit. This connectivity motif alone accounts for experimentally observed phase relationships, with PV activity consistently leading that of SOM neurons. Together, this mean field model identifies a distinct structural mechanism giving rise to oscillations in canonical E-PV-SOM circuits and provides theoretical primitives for constructing large-scale, cell-type-specific models of cortical dynamics.",

      "title": "Systemic infections alter cortical transcriptional signatures in Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by neuroinflammation, yet the impact of concurrent systemic infections on the AD brain remains poorly understood. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the central nervous system response to systemic infections in AD by analyzing RNA sequencing data generated in the prefrontal cortex from 202 post-mortem donors (113 AD, 89 controls), where we stratified by the presence of a respiratory infection at the time of death. We identified 763 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AD and controls without infection, which were enriched for oxidative phosphorylation and neurodegenerative pathways. In contrast, 122 DEGs distinguished AD from controls during infection, with 57 genes uniquely altered in AD in the presence of infection, including MAPK4, VAV3, and POU3F4, implicating infection-dependent mechanisms of vascular and immune regulation. Pathway activity analysis revealed that infection in AD suppresses some immune and vascular pathways, while enhancing transcriptional and developmental programs. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis uncovered three key modules: one module strongly associated with AD, enriched for aging and signal transduction; one module linked to both AD and infection, highlighting cytoskeletal remodelling and host-pathogen interactions; and one module specific to infection, enriched in astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells, implicating blood-brain-barrier dysfunction. These findings suggest that systemic respiratory infections reshape transcriptional programs in the AD brain, dampening immune effector pathways and engaging vascular and host-pathogen processes in blood-brain-barrier-associated cell types. Our results highlight the complex interplay between systemic infection, neuroinflammation, and vascular responses in AD.",

      "title": "Prenatal Cannabinoids Produce Sex Specific Changes in Risk Assessment and Shared Increases in Repetitive Behavior in Adult Offspring",
      "content": "The widespread perception of cannabinoids as harmless remedies has led to increasing use of both cannabidiol (CBD) and delta9--tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during pregnancy, yet their long term impact on offspring behavior remains incompletely characterized. To directly compare these compounds, pregnant mice received daily CBD or THC (3 mg/kg, gestational days 5-18) and adult progeny of both sexes were evaluated (P90-120). To capture complementary dimensions of emotional and defensive responding, we employed the elevated plus maze (EPM) to quantify anxiety related measures and ethological risk assessment postures (e.g., stretch attend) and the marble burying (MB) test to index repetitive/defensive behavior; together these assays provide convergent but distinct readouts that increase sensitivity to cannabinoid induced effects. In the EPM, prenatal CBD exposure selectively increased stretch-attend postures in females, indicating heightened risk assessment; males were unaffected, and THC produced no comparable effect. Classical EPM indices-time in open or closed arms, preference for open-arms, and total distance traveled-were unchanged across groups, except that THC-exposed females exhibited hyperlocomotion. In contrast, marble burying was increased in both sexes following prenatal exposure to either CBD or THC, indicating a shared enhancement of repetitive/defensive responses. These results show that prenatal cannabinoid exposure yields enduring, sex dependent alterations in adult behavior, with CBD selectively heightening female risk assessment and both cannabinoids increasing repetitive behavior across sexes, challenging the notion that CBD is a benign alternative to THC during gestation.",

      "title": "LRRK2 G2019S disrupts GABAergic signaling and shifts excitatory/inhibitory balance in the striatum",
      "content": "The excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance within neural circuits is essential for proper brain function, and its disruption is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson disease (PD), widespread alterations in the basal ganglia circuitry lead to an E/I imbalance in the striatum, contributing to excitotoxicity. Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has recently emerged as a key contributor to both familial and sporadic forms of PD, with the pathogenic Gly2019Ser (G2019S) mutation representing one of the most frequently observed variants. This mutation is known to exacerbate excitotoxicity by impairing glutamate reuptake mechanisms, particularly through dysregulation of EAAT2 activity and its membrane localization. In contrast, the role of LRRK2 in GABAergic transmission remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a clear modulation of inhibitory signaling by LRRK2 through a comprehensive approach combining mouse striatal slices and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LRRK2 G2019S induces a significant reduction in GABA- evoked current amplitudes. Moreover, we identified an altered distribution of receptor isoforms in pathological tissue, affecting both tonic and phasic GABA currents. Specifically, synaptic GABAA receptors containing the {gamma}2 subunit were functionally modulated by LRRK2 G2019S. The reduced availability of gephyrin in the presence of the G2019S variant may impair the gephyrin- GABAA receptor complex, leading to decreased receptor surface expression and further shifting the glutamate/GABA current ratio toward excitatory dominance. This is supported by the increased activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors observed in the pathological striatum. Overall, our findings highlight a previously underappreciated role of LRRK2 G2019S in impairing GABAergic transmission and disrupting the E/I balance. These insights point to novel circuit-level mechanisms underlying LRRK2-linked PD and suggest new avenues for the development of disease-modifying therapies targeting inhibitory dysfunction.",

      "title": "Normative models of individualized functional brain networks reveal language network expansion in autism",
      "content": "Autism spectrum disorder is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder, hindering mechanistic insights and the identification of biomarkers for clinical diagnosis. Recently, precision functional mapping has been developed to identify abnormalities in brain network topologies associated with various psychiatric disorders, yet its application in autism remains limited. Here, we utilized precision functional mapping and a large, multisite neuroimaging dataset (N = 1,182) to construct individualized functional networks in individuals with autism. We developed normative models using network surface area from healthy controls (n = 628) to characterize typical brain network organization across age, allowing for the quantification of individual-specific deviations in individuals with autism (n = 554). We found widespread and heterogeneous deviations from the normative model, with the language network emerging as the most significantly altered region, thereby emerging as an epicenter of functional disruption in autism. Individuals with autism were clustered into three subtypes involving distinct functional network topologies, associated with behavioral profiles marked by impairments in perception, language processing, or socio-emotional functioning. We further linked these atypical brain features to cortical gene expression patterns, revealing enriched pathways related to neurodevelopment, language, and signaling processes. Together, these findings reveal autism-specific deviations in individualized functional brain networks, offering potential clinical relevance for understanding and stratifying autism.",

      "title": "Cortico-cerebellar effective connectivity during adapting to vs ignoring delayed visual movement feedback",
      "content": "We modelled hemodynamic responses acquired during a virtual reality based hand-target matching task with conditions in which delayed visual movement feedback was behaviorally relevant (requiring visuomotor adaptation) vs irrelevant (i.e., needed to be ignored). We had observed increased hemodynamic responses in the cerebellum, V5, and intraparietal sulcus linked to delay-dependent adaptation. Here, we used dynamic causal modeling to test if these regional activity changes could be explained in terms of network interactions among those nodes. We found a strong excitatory influence of the right cerebellum on the bilateral V5, which increased during the visuomotor adaptation > no adaptation tasks. Furthermore, there was an increased mutual excitation among the cerebellar hemispheres, and an inhibition of the cerebella by the V5, during visuomotor adaptation. These results are consistent with the idea that the cerebellum implements forward models predicting the sensory consequences of actions, and communicates these predictions to other regions of the visuomotor control hierarchy.",
