      "title": "Vectorial boundary representation of 3D layout in human visual cortex",
      "content": "Human spatial navigation relies on the brains ability to visually represent the 3D layout of the environment. To understand how the brain encodes the layout information, it is crucial to identify the key features of environmental layout and how they are processed in the human brain. The vector coding principle, which highlight the role of boundary distance and orientation, provides a theoretical framework supported by physiological evidence from rodents. In this study, we developed a reconstruction approach to quantitatively estimate 3D layout information from natural indoor scene images. This approach enabled analyses of fMRI data from the large-scale Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) using vector-based models of 3D layout. To validate the NSD-based results and examine task-related dynamics, we further conducted fMRI and MEG experiments with navigation-related and non-navigational tasks. Controlling for low-, mid-, and high-level visual and semantic features of natural indoor scenes, we found a spatiotemporal dissociation between boundary distance and orientation representations in the human brain. Relative distance was encoded in the early visual cortex during early processing in a task-invariant manner, whereas orientation was represented in scene-selective higher visual areas during later processing and was modulated by navigation-related tasks. Importantly, task modulation manifested as feedback-induced enhancement of orientation coding in the early visual cortex. Together, these findings provide a novel perspective on how the human brain represents navigation-relevant information about the immediate surrounding environment, advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms that link perception to action in spatial navigation.",

      "title": "An integrative computational approach for obstacle avoidance during action selection",
      "content": "Action selection in cluttered environments, where individuals must simultaneously pursue goals and avoid obstacles, presents a significant challenge for the brain. To understand the underlying mechanisms of action selection in such contexts, we propose a computational model that extends stochastic optimal control theory through a novel framework for obstacle avoidance. The model decomposes action selection as a weighted combination of individual control policies, each generated for either target approach or obstacle avoidance. By integrating value information from goals, obstacles, and actions into a unified measure of \"relative desirability\", the model dynamically determines the contribution of each policy to the overall action selection process. We evaluated the framework using simulated target-reaching tasks in cluttered environments based on previous human studies. The results showed that the model captures key features of human motor behavior, including the influence of obstacle properties on movement trajectories and the transient tendency to initiate movements toward obstacles before avoidance. This work offers new insights into the dynamic interaction between approach and avoidance behaviors, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding action selection in complex and naturalistic settings.",

      "title": "Active vision modulates early cortical stages of visual processing: Evidence from MEG and eye-tracking",
      "content": "It has been hypothesized that the visual system anticipates upcoming visual input contingent on the execution of saccadic eye movements. In line with this idea, it has been shown that changes in visual input across saccades elicit stronger post-saccadic fixation-locked neural responses compared to no-change conditions; an effect known as the preview effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that this preview effect depends on active vision and cannot be explained by either classical or spatiotopic adaptation. In a gaze-contingent experiment, in which participants were cued to make saccades to object stimuli, we concurrently recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking data. The source-localized MEG signal was deconvolved with stimulus onset and eye movement events in order to account for systematic variation in gaze behavior related to the no-change (valid preview) and change (invalid preview) conditions. Crucially, preview effects in the primary visual and in ventral-occipital cortices were markedly larger when participants made saccades compared to replay blocks in which we simulated the visual consequences of saccades absent saccade execution, demonstrating that the preview effect cannot be simply explained by classic adaptation. A further control condition ruled out spatiotopic adaptation. Our results show that early visual cortical areas which are not known to exhibit saccadic remapping neurons still show signs of sequential neural history effects across saccades. Previous research might have overlooked this influence of active vision because of the lack of an invalid preview condition which breaks the correspondence between pre-saccadic extrafoveal and post-saccadic foveal stimulation.",

      "title": "Show HN: Kalendis \u2013 Scheduling API (keep your UI, we handle timezones/DST)",
      "content": "<p>Kalendis is an API-first scheduling backend. You keep your UI; we handle the gnarly parts (recurrence, time zones, DST, conflict-safe bookings).<p>What it does: \u2022 MCP tool: generates typed clients and API route handlers (Next.js/Express/Fastify/Nest) so you can scaffold calls straight from your IDE/agent tooling. \u2022 Availability engine: recurring rules + one-off exceptions/blackouts, returned in a clean, queryable shape. \u2022 Bookings: conflict-safe endpoints for creating/updating/canceling slots.<p>Why we built it: We kept rebuilding the same \"hard parts\" of scheduling: time zones/DST edge cases, recurring availability, conflict-aware booking, etc.\nWe wanted a boring, reliable backend so we could ship product features without adopting a hosted scheduling UI.<p>How it's helped: We stopped re-implementing DST/recurrence math and shipped booking flows faster. One small team (just 2 developers) built a robust booking platform for their business using Kalendis\u2014they kept full control of their UX without spending lots of cycles on scheduling infrastructure. The MCP generator cut the glue code: drop in a typed client or route, call the API, move on.<p>Some tech details: \u2022 REST API with ISO-8601 timestamps and IANA time zones \u2022 Recurring availability + one-off exceptions (designed to compose cleanly) \u2022 Focused scope: users, availability, exceptions, bookings (not a monolithic suite)<p>The MCP server exposes tools like generate-frontend-client, generate-backend-client, generate-api-routes, and list-endpoints. Add to your MCP settings:<p><pre><code>  {\n   \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"kalendis\": {\n     \"command\": \"npx\",\n     \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@kalendis/mcp\"]\n    }\n   }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nHow to try it: Create a free account \u2192 get an API key. (<a href=\"https://kalendis.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kalendis.dev</a>). Then hit an endpoint:<p><pre><code>  curl -H \"x-api-key: $KALENDIS_API_KEY\" \\\n \"https://api.kalendis.dev/v1/availability/getAvailability?userId=&amp;start=2025-10-07T00:00:00Z&amp;end=2025-10-14T00:00:00Z&amp;includeExceptions=true\"\n</code></pre>\nHappy to answer questions and post example snippets in the thread. Thanks for taking a look!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
