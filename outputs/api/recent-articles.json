      "title": "Synaptopodin KO rat for assessing the dendritic spine apparatus and axonal cisternal organelle in synaptic plasticity, development, and behavior",
      "content": "The actin-binding protein synaptopodin (Synpo) regulates the cytoskeleton and intracellular Ca2+ and is important for long-term potentiation (LTP) and learning. The inconsistent onset age for LTP in mice makes their Synpo knockout (KO) a suboptimal developmental model. Hence, we generated Synpo KO rats using CRISPR-Cas9. Synpo KO rats are viable with reduced body weight and bone length after postnatal days (P)35-P45. Their basal kidney function is normal. 3D reconstruction from electron microscopy reveals the absence of the Synpo-dependent dendritic spine apparatus and cisternal organelles in the axon initial segment (AIS), which may contribute to reduced LTP in the KO rat. Inhibitory synapses in the wild-type AIS appear preferentially clustered near cisternal organelles - a pattern disrupted in the KO, where synapses appear more uniformly distributed. The consistent developmental profile of LTP in the rat makes this KO a robust model to assess Synpo function in development, synaptic plasticity, and behavior.",

      "title": "Nutrient stress activates Rab5b-mediated autophagy to remodel the synaptic proteome",
      "content": "Synaptic proteostasis is crucial for maintaining neuronal function and plasticity, yet how synapses adapt to metabolic stress remains poorly understood. Here, we show that nutrient deprivation, particularly serum withdrawal, induces robust autophagy-dependent remodeling of the synaptic proteome, while mTORC1 inhibition has more limited effects. Nutrient stress rapidly activates autophagy both globally and at synapses, with synaptic autophagy peaking within 1-2 hours of serum withdrawal. Mechanistically, we uncover that the LC3 lipidation complex (ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1) is recruited to synapses via Rab5b-positive endosomes in a dynein-dependent manner. Live imaging reveals enhanced Rab5b-ATG16L1 co-trafficking and increased ATG5 mobility upon serum withdrawal, supporting a model of spatiotemporally controlled autophagy precursor delivery to synaptic compartments. Functionally, nutrient deprivation acutely dampens neuronal excitability in vitro, while a two-week fasting-mimicking diet in vivo triggers synaptic proteome remodeling that overlaps with starvation-induced autophagy cargo. In contrast, restriction of mTORC1-activating amino acids fails to induce comparable synaptic changes, suggesting that synaptic autophagy is regulated by nutrient signals beyond mTORC1. Our findings define a Rab5b-mediated trafficking mechanism that couples nutrient sensing to localized synaptic degradation, providing new insight into how neurons preserve proteostasis under metabolic challenge.",

This makes it easy to build multi-step agentic workflows as simple shell pipelines.<p>* Zero dependencies: It's a single Python file that uses only stdlib. Just curl it down and run it.<p>* Provider agnostic: Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI, and OpenRouter (which gives you access to dozens of models through one API key).<p>You can use it to automate things like extracting structured data from unstructured text, generating reports from logs, and building small agentic workflows without spinning up a whole framework.<p>Would love your feedback, and PRs are most welcome!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46069556\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46069556</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component.

At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "content": "IntroductionPatients with prolonged disorders of consciousness (pDoC) present significant challenges to the assessment of consciousness. This study investigated the clinical utility of motor imagery-based brain-computer interface (MI-BCI) for discriminating consciousness levels in patients with pDoC.MethodsThirty-one pDoC patients [12 with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and 19 in a minimally conscious state (MCS)] underwent EEG recordings during resting state and MI-BCI training. The analysis focused on relative power spectral density across five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma) in motor imagery-related regions (frontal and parietal cortices), along with BCI performance metrics (classification accuracy and attention indices).ResultsWe found that MCS patients exhibited multiband neural oscillation modulation during MI-BCI tasks, including slow-wave enhancement [(delta in frontal lobes (p = 0.003); theta in frontal (p = 0.026) and parietal lobes (p < 0.001)) and fast-wave suppression (alpha in frontal (p < 0.001) and parietal lobes (p = 0.049); beta in frontal (p = 0.014) and parietal lobes (p = 0.001); gamma in parietal lobes (p = 0.023)]. In contrast, UWS patients only showed localized parietal gamma enhancement (p = 0.042). Notably, the MCS group achieved significantly higher classification accuracy (55% vs. 38%, p = 0.02), and attention indices correlated moderately with CRS-R scores across all patients (Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 = 0.43, p = 0.02).ConclusionThe findings suggest that MI-BCI classification accuracy and attention indices may serve as auxiliary discriminators between UWS and MCS patients, with MCS patients demonstrating superior responsiveness to MI-BCI training.",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (last search: March 2022) selecting all studies that conducted quantitative scientific research on the ASMR phenomenon. Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

      "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.
