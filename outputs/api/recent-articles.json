      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve just released <strong>SentinelNav</strong>, a pure Python tool that creates interactive spectral maps of binary files to visualize their internal &quot;geography.&quot; It runs entirely on the standard library (no <code>pip install</code> required).</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Analyzing raw binary files (forensics, reverse engineering, or file validation) is difficult because:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hex Dumps are dense:</strong> Reading 50MB of hex code to find where a text section ends and an encrypted payload begins is mentally exhausting and slow.</li> <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> It is hard to distinguish between compressed data, random noise, and machine code just by looking at values.</li> <li><strong>Dependency Hell:</strong> Many existing visualization tools require heavy GUI frameworks (Qt) or complex environment setups just to perform a quick check.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Solution: SentinelNav</strong></p> <p>I built a deterministic engine that transforms binary data into visual clusters:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Spectral Mapping:</strong> It maps byte values to RGB colors. High-bit bytes (compiled code/media) appear Red, printable ASCII appears Green, and nulls/padding appear Blue. This allows you to visually identify file headers and sections instantly.</li> <li><strong>Architecture Heuristics:</strong> It scans raw binary chunks to detect headers (PE, ELF, Mach-O) and attempts to guess the CPU architecture (x86 vs ARM64) based on instruction alignment and opcode frequency.</li> <li><strong>Entropy Analysis:</strong> It calculates Shannon entropy per block to detect anomalies, such as &quot;Flux events&quot; where data transitions from structured to random (encryption boundaries).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example / How to Run</strong></p> <p>Since it relies on the standard library, it works out of the box:</p> <pre><code># No dependencies to install python3 sentinelnav.py my_firmware.bin </code></pre> <p>This spawns a local web server. You can then open your browser to:</p> <ol> <li>Navigate the file map using <strong>WASD</strong> keys (like a game).</li> <li>Click colored blocks to inspect the <strong>Hex Dump</strong> and <strong>ArchID</strong> analysis.</li> <li>Export the visualization as a <strong>.BMP</strong> image.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Reverse Engineers, CTF players, Security Analysts, and developers interested in file structures.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Binwalk:</strong> Great for extraction, but lacks interactive visualization.</li> <li><strong>Veles / Cantordust:</strong> Powerful but often unmaintained or require complex installations.</li> <li><strong>SentinelNav:</strong> Focuses on being lightweight, zero-dependency, and &quot;drop-and-run&quot; compatible with any system that has Python 3 installed.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Concurrency:</strong> Uses <code>concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor</code> to crunch entropy math across all CPU cores.</li> <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Uses an ephemeral <code>sqlite3</code> database to index analysis chunks, allowing it to paginate through files larger than available RAM.</li> <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> A custom HTML5 Canvas rendering engine embedded directly in the Python script.</li> <li><strong>Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/smolfiddle/SentinelNav\">https://github.com/smolfiddle/SentinelNav</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FiddleSmol\"> /u/FiddleSmol </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pa91j5/i_built_sentinelnav_a_zerodependency_binary_file/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pa91j5/i_built_sentinelnav_a_zerodependency_binary_file/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Single-channel EEG-based sleep stage classification via hybrid data distillation",
      "content": "Objective. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, more and more researchers have begun developing end-to-end automatic sleep stage classification frameworks. However, these frameworks typically require access to large electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets for training, which imposes a significant computational burden. Furthermore, EEG data contains patient privacy information, and using such data for training raises concerns about privacy infringement. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid data distillation method. We aim to enable single-channel EEG sleep stage classification with less training cost and privacy risk by distilling large real datasets into a tiny, privacy-preserving synthetic set for training from scratch. Approach. We first apply the gradient matching method to optimize the randomly initialized synthetic dataset. The gradient changes in the early stages of model training can quickly reduce the performance gap between the synthetic dataset and the source dataset. Subsequently, to avoid oscillations near the optimal solution during gradient matching, we switch to distribution matching to further optimize the synthetic dataset. This method aligns the data distribution at a global level, enhancing overall consistency. In addition, we adopt a novel mini-batch iteration method to assist the synthetic dataset in learning temporal dependencies. Main results. We validated our framework on three public datasets and achieved robust results. Significance. This study proposes an efficient and robust hybrid data distillation algorithm, providing a feasible approach for implementing sleep stage staging based on privacy protection.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "AAV-mediated regeneration of neurons in injury-induced and inherited retinal degeneration",
      "content": "Loss of retinal neurons is a leading cause of irreversible vision impairment, yet adult mammalian retinas lack the ability to regenerate these cells. In this study, we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy to reprogram endogenous Muller glia into retinal neurons. Using stringent genetic lineage tracing, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology and single-cell multiomic profiling, we show that AAV delivery of a stabilized, phospho-insensitive Neurogenin2 variant (Neurog2-9SA) efficiently converts Muller glia into multiple types of retinal neurons, including bipolar, starburst amacrine, and a small population of photoreceptor-like cells, in both injury-induced and inherited retinal degeneration models. The generated neurons exhibit electrical properties of retinal neurons, light-evoked responses and integrate into existing retinal circuitry. Single-cell multiomics analysis reveal that Neurog2-9SA induces reprogramming by remodeling chromatin accessibility, activating neurogenic transcriptional networks, and represses glial identity programs. Inhibiting Notch signaling markedly enhances reprogramming efficiency. Together, these findings establish Neurog2-9SA as a potent and clinically relevant factor for AAV-mediated reprogramming and provide a foundation for approaches to regenerate neuronal cells and restore function in retinal diseases.",

      "content": "Tauopathies, including Alzheimer disease, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological aggregation of the microtubule associated protein Tau (MAPT). This study explores the neuroprotective properties of anastrozole, a clinical Aromatase inhibitor, in both a Drosophila tauopathy model expressing human MAPTR406W and isogenic pairs of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons expressing MAPT mutations. The Aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, initially identified in a Drosophila MAPTR406W drug screen, reduced oxidative stress and Tau phosphorylation in cultured cortical neurons. Its protective effects were not mediated by Aromatase activity or cholesterol metabolism: screening in Drosophila identified CYP4V2 as a potential off-target. Knockdown of CYP4V2 in MAPTR406W neurons recapitulated protection against oxidative stress-induced cell death. These findings position anastrozole and its off-target CYP4V2 as novel therapeutic avenues for primary tauopathies and potentially Alzheimer disease and related dementias by reducing Tau phosphorylation and susceptibility to oxidative stress.",

      "content": "<p>I'm writing this 38 hours before I go into a surgery on Monday that I may not survive, and while I am told I have a better than 50/50 chance of making it to this time next year, I still feel, though I am too young (early 50s) to deal with these things, that I have wasted too much time. I'd like to impart some lessons.<p>1. A small number of accomplishments really mean something, but you often won't know which ones. I started three companies and two were successes, and even though they comprised more than two decades of my life, I feel like I remember a grand total of six important hours between them. Meanwhile, I still remember the shed I built for my father in the first summer after college. Whatever seems unimportant, you will care about the most.<p>2. The thing you do today, you will probably do tomorrow. I've wasted a lot of time, but most people I know have wasted lots of time, and it's because of the tendency to make an exception of the present day, which either excuses laziness or pathological busyness, which is a form of the same thing. \"I'll do it tomorrow.\" But tomorrow it will be today. It's always today.<p>3. Ethics matter. I don't believe there's any life after this one, but I find myself ruminating on what I've done. In 2015, I had a lot of interaction with a startup incubator you know well, and ended up sitting in the discussions and planning around banning and erasing a young programmer we considered a threat to our financial interests, due to his concerns about authoritarianism in technology. In retrospect, he was harmless, but an example had to be made. The decision was made to ban him here, try to get him fired though I don't know if we succeeded, and attack him with sockpuppets on Reddit, and it seems to have worked because you don't hear his name much.<p>Ten years later, I'm still stuck thinking about this. Am I the kind of person who does shitty things? I was. Am I still? How would I even know?<p>I don't believe that faith is an out, or that you can apologize or donate your way out of past behaviors. You will always be the person who has done what you have done.<p>4. Be kind to animals. There are few joys like having a dog. I always refused when my ex-wife wanted one, and she got one after we separated. For her, it was probably an upgrade.<p>5. I developed a knack for founding companies, but I never learned how to build communities. They aren't the same thing. You might have three hundred people at your company and you truly feel like they are your village, but they're not. Circumstances will change, and people will move, and in five years, most of them will not remember your name.<p>That's probably enough for now. My mind goes between periods of racing and long spells of languid acceptance. All humans end up in the place where I am, and I hope you reach it with fewer regrets than I have.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46092688\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46092688</a></p>\n<p>Points: 84</p>\n<p># Comments: 14</p>",

      "title": "Efficient in vivo mammalian neuron editing using peptide-mediated CRISPR enzyme delivery",
      "content": "CRISPR-mediated genome editing of the central nervous system (CNS) has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease (HD). However, the development of CRISPR therapeutics for the CNS has been hindered by challenges associated with delivery, specifically the lack of a clinically compatible, non-viral delivery technology facilitating genome editing of neurons in vivo. For most indications, two key obstacles must be overcome before therapeutic genome editing of the brain is feasible: non-toxic intracellular delivery of CRISPR cargo into neurons and establishment of strategies enabling targeted brain regions to be edited efficiently. While viral vectors have shown promise in pre-clinical models, non-viral approaches present distinct advantages: ease of manufacture as well as the transient presence of CRISPR machinery, which tempers risks of genotoxicity and immunogenicity. Peptide-enabled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery of CRISPR (PERC) has emerged as a promising non-viral delivery strategy for CRISPR enzymes with initial use in primary human immune cells. In this study, we report the development of Neuro-PERC, a streamlined and optimized approach for in vivo editing of mammalian neurons. Administration of Neuro-PERC reagents via convection-enhanced delivery (CED) mediated efficient and well-tolerated neuronal genome editing. Neuro-PERC enabled robust neuronal editing in the brain of both small and large animal reporter models, and increased survival in a severe murine model of Huntington's disease. These results establish CED-administered Neuro-PERC as a candidate delivery technology to hasten clinical translation of CRISPR-based therapies for diseases of the CNS.",

      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",
