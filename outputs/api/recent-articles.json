      "title": "Body and brain signalling during naturalistic learning situations",
      "content": "A central challenge in supporting learning and designing learning environments is to understand individual differences in learning experiences. However, despite growing interest in examining learning experiences in naturalistic contexts, studies employing multimethod and hyperscanning approaches remain scarce. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) were combined to measure brain activity, heart rate, and heart rate variability simultaneously during authentic learning situations in aviation and forestry. We investigated how students and instructors cardiac and brain activity varied across different phases of a naturalistic learning situation and tasks with varying levels of difficulty. Results indicate that both students and instructors heart rate, heart rate variability, and brain activity vary systematically across behaviourally and pedagogically meaningful phases of the learning situation. These findings enhance our understanding of how physiological and neural activity vary within and across individuals during learning, providing insight into the nervous system determinants underlying individual differences in learning experiences.",

      "title": "Multimodal Imaging-Based Targeting Approach for Network-Level Brain Stimulation",
      "content": "Background: Neural network effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are poorly understood. Here, we introduce an empirically informed, multimodal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based framework suited for guiding stimulation target selection and hypothesis-based data analysis in focal tDCS-fMRI studies. Methods: We illustrate our approach using data of 37 healthy individuals (19 females; mean +/- SD age = 25.8 +/- 5.9) recruited from a multicenter tDCS-fMRI study (www.memoslap.de/en/home/). Participants completed resting-state (RS- and task-fMRI (object-location memory, OLM, or associative picture-pseudoword learning, APPL, experiments) with placebo tDCS. Seed-based RS data analysis identified the functional networks originating from project-specific target regions for focal tDCS (right occipito-temporal cortex, rOTC; left ventral IFG, lvIFG) and also established their test-retest reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Dice coefficients analyzed the overlap between the seeded RS- and task-evoked networks. This aimed to identify task-active regions potentially affected by downstream neural network effects from the target regions. Results: Seed-based analyses identified two highly reliable ventral visual-limbic (rOTC) and language-related networks (lvIFG), with >72-77% of voxels showing good-to-excellent TRR (ICC >/=; 0.75). Only a subset of voxels identified by the RS analyses overlapped with activity elicited by the experimental paradigms (ranging from 7-55%), with larger correspondence for the OLM task (Dice OLM: 0.249-0.349; APPL 0.112-0.121). Therefore, the degree of potential tDCS network effects varied substantially depending on the target region, the extent of its functional network and task-specific activity patterns. Degree of correspondence was further mediated by the selected contrasts-of-interest in the task-based analyses, with more conservative control conditions resulting in reduced overlap. Conclusion: We established a principled, multimodal fMRI framework bridging a critical gap in neuromodulation research. By integrating reliable intrinsic connectivity maps with task-evoked activity patterns, we provide a method to prospectively identify network-level targets for focal brain stimulation and to generate hypotheses for data analyses in tDCS-fMRI studies. This approach paves the way for investigating modulation of specific functional networks, shifting the rationale from stimulating an isolated brain region to strategically targeting key nodes within a predefined functional pathway.",

      "title": "Developmental scarcity induces sex differences in social recognition and CA2 perineuronal nets",
      "content": "Early-life adversity has a lasting negative impact on social behavior in both humans and rodents. Sex differences exist in functional outcomes of postnatal stress, but underlying mechanisms remain incompletely explored. Using the limited bedding and nesting paradigm, a mouse model of developmental scarcity, we found sex differences in social behavior with adult males showing impaired social recognition and adult females showing intact social recognition with enhanced social novelty preference. Perineuronal nets, specialized extracellular matrix structures, are known to inhibit developmental plasticity and are concentrated in the CA2 region of the hippocampus in adulthood. We found higher intensity of CA2 perineuronal nets in adult males, but not adult females, after early life adversity. Focal degradation of the extracellular matrix in the CA2 region restored social recognition function in adult males previously subjected to early stress, suggesting that the effects of developmental adversity may be overcome by targeted intervention in adulthood.",

      "title": "Repeatable, low-drift recordings in behaving non-human primates using flexible microelectrodes",
      "content": "Neurophysiological recordings from non-human primates (NHPs) have traditionally relied on rigid microelectrode arrays made from stainless steel or silicon. While these devices enable high-quality recordings, a fundamental mechanical mismatch between rigid materials and soft brain tissue leads to inflammation, gliosis, and signal instability. In particular, brain micromotion causes continuous drifting of neurons relative to fixed electrodes, compromising single-unit tracking during both chronic and acute recordings. Flexible, penetrating electrodes offer a promising solution, but their adoption in NHPs has been hindered by the technical challenges of delivering ultra-thin polymers through thick dura mater. Here, we demonstrate a comprehensive approach for acute, repeated recordings in awake, behaving NHPs using flexible arrays. We fabricated a microelectrode array that spans cortical layers with 32 cellular-scale recording sites embedded in 7 m-thick parylene-C. We developed a novel \"telescopic\" insertion method that combines concentric guide tubes with a retractable microwire shuttle. Our technique is compatible with standard chronic recording chambers and allowed for repeated penetration of free-floating arrays through intact dura over weeks without the need for a new craniotomy. Across two awake rhesus macaques, we optimized the electrode geometry and insertion procedure to achieve an 80% single-unit recording success rate. As animals performed an oculomotor delayed response task, we recorded task-responsive neurons from prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex with stable single-unit activity throughout 1-2-hour behavioral sessions. Critically, by comparing our flexible arrays to rigid probes in the same animals and recording chambers, we provide quantitative evidence that flexible electrodes reduce total single-unit drift from hundreds to tens of microns. Our work establishes flexible microelectrode arrays as a practical, dependable technology for NHP neuroscience and paves the way toward long-term, ultra-stable neurophysiology in large animal models.",

      "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.
