      "title": "Synthetic modulation of brain-wide anesthesia-activated neural ensembles using a transgenic mouse system",
      "content": "Anesthetics are commonly used to produce unconsciousness, but the neural substrates of unconsciousness remain poorly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that general anesthesia works by targeting discrete cell types and neural circuits distributed brain-wide, rather than non-specific binding, using a mouse transgenic system. We take advantage of a mouse that expresses chemogenetic designer receptors exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADDs) in an inducible Cre-dependent manner driven by Fos immediate early gene expression. Since Fos expression peaks with metabolic activity, we use this system to insert synthetic DREADDs into brain-wide neurons that are active under isoflurane anesthesia. We then test the behavioral consequences of chemogenetic stimulation of anesthesia-activated neural ensembles. We observe immobility, discoordination, anti-nociception, and significantly increased anesthetic sensitivity, but not a loss of consciousness as measured by the righting reflex. We next describe brain-wide expression of the captured neurons across the intact mouse brain using iDisco+ whole brain clearing and light sheet microscopy, revealing unique morphological characteristics of sparse, spatially distributed cells. This provides a brain-wide morphologic map with detailed neurite labeling of anesthesia-activated neurons at cellular resolution as a technical resource for the field.",

      "title": "Multiscale Spatial Transcriptomic Atlas of Human Basal Ganglia Cell-Type and Cellular Community Organization",
      "content": "We generated a multi-region, subcellular-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of the human basal ganglia by integrating MERFISH+ and Stereo-seq across four neurotypical donors. These datasets profiled ~7 million cells spanning the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and globus pallidus, resolving 60 transcriptionally distinct cell types. We show region-selective, molecular and spatial diversification of medium-spiny-neuron cell types and multiple non-neuronal populations with distinct molecular identities and spatial localizations. Subcellular RNA localization captures somatic size and projection-inferred signatures that reflect direct and indirect pathway topology. Cellular community analyses reveal the enrichment of sub-clusters of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes at striosome-matrix borders, while primate-expanded interneurons are confined to matrix territories. Cross-species mapping uncovers orthologous striosome-matrix organization and conserved dorsolateral-ventromedial gene expression gradients. This atlas provides a foundational molecular and spatial framework for studying human basal ganglia architecture, offering a multi-centimeter scale resource that links cell types, spatial architecture, and subcellular transcript topography across multiple nuclei.",

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Inhibitory control underpins the relationship between cognitive and psychological inflexibility after a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury.",
      "content": "Objective: Cognitive flexibility is proposed as being one \u201cbuilding block\u201d of psychological inflexibility/flexibility, yet empirical studies examining these associations are scarce. This study aims to examine the relationship between these constructs in those with a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who demonstrate impairments in cognitive flexibility. Method: A total of 66 individuals with a traumatic brain injury were administered a battery of cognitive flexibility measures in conjunction with their standard neuropsychological assessment, general (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013II [AAQ-II]) and context-specific (Acceptance and Action Questionnaire\u2013Acquired Brain Injury [AAQ-ABI]) measures of psychological inflexibility and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321). Results: Linear regression modeling found the Stroop color\u2013word interference score was the only measure of cognitive flexibility that was significantly associated with AAQ-ABI (\u03b2 = \u2212.14, <em>p</em> < .001), a finding that remained when controlling for Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient and education. Similarly, the Stroop color\u2013word interference score significantly predicted the AAQ-II (\u03b2 = \u22120.13, <em>p</em> = .024). Simple mediation analysis found the AAQ-ABI and AAQ-II fully mediated the relationship between the Stroop color\u2013word interference score and psychological distress. Conclusions: This research provides support for the theory of cognitive flexibility being an essential component of psychological inflexibility. Inhibitory control may be an important process within cognitive flexibility that contributes to psychological inflexibility. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Lemborexant Reduces Infarct Volume and Improves Long-Term Functional Recovery in a Murine Model of Ischemic Stroke",
      "content": "Introduction: Recovery following ischemic stroke is highly variable and often incomplete, underscoring the urgent need to develop novel targeted poststroke treatments. While the mechanisms underlying poststroke recovery remain incompletely understood, sleep fragmentation, a common consequence of stroke, has been linked to worse patient outcomes. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that promotes sleep by suppressing wakefulness and enhancing sleep continuity. We hypothesized that lemborexant would reduce poststroke sleep disturbances and promote recovery in a rodent model of stroke. Methods: We examined the effects of lemborexant (10mg/kg and 30mg/kg) and zolpidem (30 mg/kg) on sleep macrostructure, fragmentation, and EEG spectra in both healthy mice and in stroke model mice, which underwent photothrombotic ischemia of the forelimb somatosensory cortex. We also evaluated whether 12 days of drug administration altered infarct volume and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice. Results: Lemborexant treatment (30mg/kg) increased the percentage of NREM sleep, while preserving sleep continuity, in both healthy and stroke model mice. In contrast, zolpidem increased NREM sleep after stroke, but also increased sleep fragmentation in both groups. Lemborexant treatment at 10mg/kg and 30mg/kg significantly reduced infarct volume eight weeks after the induction of stroke. In addition, lemborexant-treated mice showed greater use of the impaired limb four weeks after stroke. Interpretation: These preclinical findings suggest that lemborexant stabilizes sleep and promotes structural and functional recovery following the experimental induction of stroke in model mice, supporting its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention following ischemic stroke.",

      "title": "Cognitive impairment and progressive neuroinflammation in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice expressing the R245H Sgsh variant",
      "content": "Aims: Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type IIIA (Sanfilippo syndrome) is an inherited childhood-onset dementia caused by insufficient SGSH enzymatic activity and subsequent accumulation of partially degraded heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. One of the most prevalent mutations is the Arg245His variant, representing up to 58% of mutations in some populations. Whilst other mouse models exist, their applicability to, and translational delivery of, clinically relevant pharmacological chaperones is limited. We therefore aimed to generate and characterise a novel SgshR245H knock-in mouse model of MPS IIIA. Methods: CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing introduced the SgshR245H mutation, and a breeding colony was established. Mouse behaviour was evaluated in a test battery; SGSH activity and heparan sulfate levels were measured using fluorometric and mass spectrometric assays, respectively; and histological staining was undertaken to characterise brain pathology. Results: Spatial memory and learning deficits were apparent in the Morris Water Maze probe and Y-maze tests. Elevated Plus Maze exploration revealed reduced anxiety-like behaviours. SgshR245H mice exhibited progressive accumulation of brain heparan sulfate and elevated levels of GFAP-reactive astroglial staining and activated microglia. Conclusion: SgshR245H MPS IIIA mice recapitulate key characteristics of the human disorder, representing a useful tool for studying disease pathogenesis and evaluating novel therapies.",

      "content": "Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 7 (CLN7) is a devastating paediatric neurodegenerative disorder with no cure and limited natural history data to guide therapeutic development. Here, we present the first multimodal characterization of prodromal and early-stage CLN7 disease in Japanese macaques carrying a spontaneous CLN7-/- mutation. Using structural T2-weighted MRI for volumetry, [18F]FDG PET for glucose metabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET for neuroinflammation, we observed region-dependent patterns in volumetric, molecular, and metabolic alterations. MRI confirmed the presence of disease-associated atrophy in many cortical and subcortical brain regions, consistent with human pathology, [18F]FDG PET revealed early cortical and subcortical widespread hypometabolism, and [11C]PBR28 PET imaging detected progressive neuroinflammation in the same brain areas. CSF analyses further showed age-dependent increases in neurofilament light (NfL), providing convergent evidence for neurodegeneration. Together, these results define a prodromal trajectory in CLN7 disease , establish sensitive imaging and fluid biomarkers, and validate the macaque model as a powerful platform for testing interventions.",
