      "title": "Cortical responses to balance perturbations persist without active postural control",
      "content": "Standing balance relies on rapid reflexes as well as longer-latency subcortical and cortical processes to generate corrective responses to postural disturbances. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies consistently identify two perturbation-evoked markers of cortical activity, the balance N1 and midfrontal theta power, associated with changes in body orientation and corrective actions. It remains unclear, however, whether these markers depend on the nervous system's active control of posture or reflect a more general evaluation of unexpected sensory input. We tested this by measuring cortical and muscle activity during support-surface perturbations while systematically manipulating whether participants actively controlled posture. In Experiment 1 (n = 10), participants experienced identical perturbations while either actively balancing or being passively moved through equivalent motion. Despite large reductions in balance-correcting muscle activity during passive trials (~30-60%), N1 and theta responses persisted with only modest amplitude reductions (~10%). In Experiment 2 (n = 16), we created passive conditions increasingly removed from balance by varying sensory feedback (footplate + whole-body vs footplate-only motion) and motor engagement (isometric contraction vs. relaxed posture). Relaxed postures markedly suppressed muscle responses, yet cortical responses persisted, showing only modest modulation with sensory feedback (larger during footplate-only rotations) and no dependence on motor engagement. Together, these results indicate that N1 and midfrontal theta are not dependent on active postural control and persist even without matching sensory feedback or motor engagement. Rather than reflecting the generation or scaling of corrective actions, they index the early detection and evaluation of unexpected sensory events, consistent with prediction error or surprise processing.",

      "title": "Focal brain stimulation sites that modify autonomic arousal map to a convergent brain circuit and potential therapeutic target",
      "content": "Causal modulation of autonomic outflow could yield new therapeutic targets for autonomic hyperactivation. We employed three natural experiments in which different brain regions were targeted using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (n=139 sites, n=14 individuals), deep brain stimulation (n=392 sites, n=58 individuals), or low-intensity focused ultrasound (n=46 sites, n=23 individuals) with subsequent autonomic measurements. Using a human connectome database (n=1000) as a wiring diagram, we identified a convergent brain circuit that, when focally modulated, transiently reduces autonomic arousal. This circuit significantly resembled previously reported causal circuits for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. In independent datasets, TMS to the autonomic arousal circuit reduced laboratory startle in healthy volunteers (n=28), lesions to this circuit reduced exaggerated startle in PTSD (n=193), and TMS to this circuit reduced anxiety-related autonomic symptoms in patients with clinically significant anxiety (n=30). Thus, the convergent circuit may serve as a potential neuromodulation target for autonomic hyperactivation.",

      "title": "Energetic implications of fMRI-based nodal complex network metrics: a complex picture unfolds across diverse brain states",
      "content": "Functional MRI-based graph theory has provided profound insights into the brain's functional organization, yet the neuroenergetic meaning of widely used graph-theoretical metrics remains poorly understood. Although resting-state research suggests a positive coupling between network topology and glucose metabolism, it remains unclear whether this relationship reflects a general principle of brain organization or a state-specific phenomenon. Here, we test the neuroenergetic interpretability of nodal graph-theoretical metrics by linking complex network topology to cerebral glucose consumption across diverse brain states. Leveraging simultaneous functional PET-MRI, we directly compare state-dependent fluctuations in glucose consumption and network topology during sensory, cognitive, and arousal conditions. We further assess metabolic-topological couplings in disease through a meta-analysis of resting-state FDG-PET and fMRI studies involving Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Our results show that nodal graph-theoretical metrics exhibit state- and network-dependent metabolic associations, with coupling patterns diverging across experimental and disease contexts. Notably, frontoparietal and attentional networks show more conserved metabolic-topological coupling than other large-scale networks across states. These findings underscore a dynamic, complex interplay between metabolic demand and complex network organization, highlighting the need for a nuanced interpretation of the energetic underpinnings of nodal graph-theoretical metrics in health and disease.",

      "title": "Transferable CNN-based data mining approaches for medical imaging: application to spine DXA scans for osteoporosis detection",
      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",
