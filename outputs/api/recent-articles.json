      "title": "Dynamical models reveal distance to criticality in ageing brain dynamics.",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain changes with age remains a central question in neuroscience. Here, we combine magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from young and older adults with a whole-brain dynamical model to explore how brain dynamics evolve across the lifespan. Using a network of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators constrained by empirical structural connectivity, we systematically vary three model parameters to identify the settings that best reproduce alpha-band features observed in MEG data. Our findings reveal age-related shifts in these model parameters: older individuals exhibit stronger global coupling and more positive values of the bifurcation parameter, consistent with a transition to a supercritical regime. These results align with prior work suggesting altered excitation-inhibition balance in ageing and indicate a systematic reconfiguration of whole-brain dynamics. By situating empirical observations within a dynamical systems framework, this study provides a principled approach for quantifying the brains distance to criticality and lays the groundwork for future clinical applications.",

      "title": "Using Propensity Score Matching to Control for MRI Scan Quality",
      "content": "Movement during MRI scanning complicates distinguishing between the different tissues in the brain (e.g., grey and white matter). Standard practice excludes scans based on researcher-determined visual quality thresholds. Unfortunately, children, elderly, and clinical populations are shown to move more, resulting in higher exclusion rates. This disproportionate exclusion creates systematic bias in the literature and makes research findings less generalizable. Furthermore, the artifacts caused by motion are demonstrated to continue to confound data, even after visual quality control has occurred. We aimed to minimize the confounding factor of systematic group differences in movement. To achieve this, we used a post-scanning statistical technique called propensity score matching (PSM) that matches control and patient populations on scan quality metrics, leading to more comparable groups, greater inclusion, and more generalizable results. We found that PSM can attenuate significant differences in scan quality between groups while allowing for greater sample diversity than standard exclusion protocols. Crucially, using PSM can also alter the results of neuroimaging-based analyses. Using three datasets (total n = 1536), we compared voxel based morphometry analyses based on different quality control protocols. In particular, we observed discrepant results between PSM and strict threshold exclusion, with PSM magnifying some regional group differences and diminishing others. Overall, PSM is a customizable way to mitigate the impact of confounds in neuroimaging research and a powerful method to help distinguish true effects from artifacts.",

      "title": "Dopamine receptor sensitivity and Pavlovian conditioned approach",
      "content": "Understanding the determinants of individual differences in cue-reactivity and drug sensitivity is critical to identifying neurobiological mechanisms underlying vulnerability to addiction. In this study, we examined the relationship between dopamine D1 and D2 receptor sensitivity and the attribution of incentive salience to reward cues and sensitivity to cocaine. Male Sprague Dawley rats were classified as having high or low sensitivity to the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole, and a subset was tested with the D1 receptor agonist SKF 82958. Cue-reactivity was assessed using a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA) task, which distinguishes between sign-tracking (approach to a cue that predicts reward) and goal-tracking (approach to the site of reward delivery). Cocaine sensitivity was measured by locomotor activity and 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), a putative measure of appetitive states. High D2 responders exhibited more sign-tracking and greater cocaine-induced USVs than low responders despite no difference in cocaine-induced locomotion. Sign-trackers also showed greater locomotor sensitivity to D1 receptor stimulation than goal-trackers and produced more cocaine-induced USVs. Rats with high sensitivity to both D1 and D2 receptor stimulation showed the strongest sign-tracking behavior and affective response to cocaine. These findings suggest that dopamine receptor sensitivity is associated with the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues and potentially the appetitive effects of cocaine. This dopaminergic phenotype may reflect a mechanism contributing to both individual differences in cue-reactivity and drug responsiveness.",

      "content": "Tracking neuronal voltage changes using fluorescent voltage indicators is rapidly reshaping neuroscientific research. Voltage imaging enables direct visualization of electrical signals from subcellular compartments to large-scale networks, yet requires sophisticated image-analysis procedures. Here, we present a comprehensive study of current voltage imaging analysis pipelines and discuss the experimental conditions for which they are most suitable. We compare strengths and limitations of these pipelines in motion correction, denoising and segmentation routines, and discuss how different signal processing strategies can influence data integrity and interpretation. Our results show that most real-time analyses require GPU accelerated algorithms and that denoising prior to signal processing is needed for analysis of subcellular dynamics. We conclude that voltage imaging analyses needs to be tailored to different experimental settings: we propose a decision-tree to determine analysis strategies for diverse experimental conditions. Together, these insights pave the way for reproducible, high-fidelity voltage imaging studies.",

      "title": "Study of Sex Differences in the Whole Brain White Matter Using Diffusion MRI Tractography and Suprathreshold Fiber Cluster Statistics",
      "content": "Sex-specific characteristics demonstrate a substantial influence on the human brain white matter, suggesting distinct brain structural connectivity patterns between females and males. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is an important tool in assessing white matter connectivity and brain tissue microstructure across different populations. Whole brain white matter analysis using dMRI tractography for group statistical comparison is a challenging task due to the large number of white matter connections. In this work, we study whole-brain white matter connectivity differences between females and males using dMRI tractography. We study a large cohort of 707 healthy adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. By applying a well-established fiber clustering pipeline and a suprathreshold fiber cluster statistical method, we evaluated tracts in the cerebral cortex, as well as those connecting to regions such as the cerebellum, which have been relatively less studied using dMRI tractography. We identified several tracts that differed significantly between females and males in terms of their fractional anisotropy and/or mean diffusivity. These included several deep white matter tracts (e.g., arcuate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum) that have been previously shown to have sex differences, as well as superficial white matter tracts in the frontal lobe. However, there were relatively few cortical association tracts that exhibited significant sex differences. We also identified cerebellar tracts with sex differences. Finally, correlation analysis revealed that these white matter differences were linked to a range of neurobehavioral measures, with the strongest and most consistent associations observed for motor function. Overall, these findings provide characterizations of sex differences in the white matter and indicate that the circuits underlying motor function may be an important focus of future work on sex differences in the human brain.",

      "title": "Outdoor Air Pollution, Perivascular Space Morphology, and Cognition in Preadolescence",
      "content": "Background: Ambient air pollution exposure is associated with structural brain differences and poorer cognition in children; however, mechanisms of toxicity remain unclear. Perivascular spaces (PVS), key for brain waste clearance, may play a role in the neurotoxicity of air pollution. This study explored associations between air pollution exposure, PVS morphology, and cognition in preadolescents. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study data from 6,949 9-10-year-old participants. Annual average exposures to PM2.5, O3, NO2, and 15 PM2.5 components were estimated using spatiotemporal models mapped to residential addresses. PVS count and volume were derived from T1w and T2w MRI, and cognition was estimated using NIH Toolbox scores. Linear mixed-effects models examined independent associations between air pollution, PVS, and cognition; weighted quantile sum regression assessed co-exposure effects of PM2.5 mixtures. Findings: Linear models revealed that exposures to Zn, NH4+, and Br were positively associated with PVS count in several regions. Higher PVS count in five key regions was associated with poorer cognitive performance across several NIH Toolbox domains. Higher Ca, Zn, and NH4+ exposures were associated with poorer cognition (PFDR < 0.01). Higher frontal lobe PVS count mediated the association between Zn exposure and poorer total cognition (P < 0.01). Co-exposure models revealed that PM2.5 mixtures were associated with higher temporal and cingulate PVS count, and poorer working memory and crystallized intelligence (P < 0.01). Interpretation: Outdoor air pollution was associated with higher PVS count and reduced cognition, suggesting that brain clearance may be a novel mechanism linking pollution to neurodevelopmental harm in preadolescents.",

      "content": "Individuals adopt different encoding strategies to facilitate learning. However, few studies have investigated the neurophysiological basis that support these different encoding strategies across individuals. The present work addresses this gap by extending our previous findings on the direct relationship between cortical spectral power, measured via resting-state magnetoencephalography, and performance on standard cognitive test results. Our results highlight the complex interactions between endogenous brain oscillations, learning and verbal encoding strategies assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-2). First, we found that resting-state theta oscillations were significantly associated with verbal learning and subjective clustering strategies. Second, we observed that semantic clustering is facilitated by oscillatory patterns in left sensory-motor brain regions. Finally, our analyses revealed that serial and semantic clustering strategies are related to opposite regression patterns, indicating a competitive interaction. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the neural oscillatory dynamics that support diverse encoding strategies in verbal learning.",

      "title": "Domain-Specific Functional Network Adaptations Supporting Dual-Task Performance in Older Adults",
      "content": "Aging is associated with declines in both motor and cognitive functions, which are well captured by dual task gait paradigms. However, the functional brain network mechanisms supporting motor and cognitive aspects of dual task performance in aging remain unclear. We examined 40 older adults (50 to 80 years) and 20 younger adults (20 to 40 years) who performed a motor single task (pedaling), a cognitive single-task (Go/NoGo), and a combined cognitive motor dual task during functional magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) using a custom-built MRI compatible pedaling device. Behaviorally, older adults showed significant dual task costs in motor performance, while cognitive performance was preserved. Neurally, older adults showed selective increases in connectivity within executive and motor-planning regions of cognitive networks, consistent with compensatory recruitment, whereas motor networks underwent broader reorganization, with strengthened frontoparietal control circuits but weakened cerebello-parietal and sensorimotor pathways. Multivariate analyses further revealed age related differences in latent connectivity behavior relationships: motor network patterns in older adults were more dispersed, reflecting heterogeneous reorganization, whereas cognitive-network patterns were more overlapping across groups, suggesting relative preservation. These findings suggest that aging involves a domain specific balance of resilience and vulnerability across brain networks and highlight motor-network adaption as a promising target for understanding why some older adults maintain function while others decline.",

      "title": "In-situ glial cell-surface proteomics identifies pro-longevity factors in Drosophila",
      "content": "Much focus has shifted towards understanding how glial dysfunction contributes to age-related neurodegeneration due to the critical roles glial cells play in maintaining healthy brain function. Cell-cell interactions, which are largely mediated by cell-surface proteins, control many critical aspects of development and physiology; as such, dysregulation of glial cell-surface proteins in particular is hypothesized to play an important role in age-related neurodegeneration. However, it remains technically difficult to profile glial cell-surface proteins in intact brains. Here, we applied a cell-surface proteomic profiling method to glial cells from intact brains in Drosophila, which enabled us to fully profile cell-surface proteomes in-situ, preserving native cell-cell interactions that would otherwise be omitted using traditional proteomics methods. Applying this platform to young and old flies, we investigated how glial cell-surface proteomes change during aging. We identified candidate genes predicted to be involved in brain aging, including several associated with neural development and synapse wiring molecules not previously thought to be particularly active in glia. Through a functional genetic screen, we identified one surface protein, DIP-{beta}, which is down-regulated in old flies and can increase fly lifespan when overexpressed in adult glial cells. We further performed whole-head single-nucleus RNA-seq, and revealed that DIP-{beta} overexpression mainly impacts glial and fat cells. We also found that glial DIP-{beta} overexpression was associated with improved cell-cell communication, which may contribute to the observed lifespan extension. Our study is the first to apply in-situ cell-surface proteomics to glial cells in Drosophila, and to identify DIP-{beta} as a potential glial regulator of brain aging.",

We developed a video monitored behavioral platform with machine learning classifiers to unravel discrete changes in natural mouse behaviors. THC infusion into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) disrupted walking kinematic features characteristic of impairment responses. THC predominantly increased mPFC GABAergic activity preceding walk initiation shifting the mPFC excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. Pose-defined closed loop photo-stimulation of mPFC GABAergic neurons demonstrated that THC exacerbates selected parameters of motor impairment. Surprisingly, THC also induced a time locked, movement-induced, transient potentiation of mPFC endocannabinoid (eCB) release and ensuing CB1R-mediated synaptic inhibition. Here we establish that THC-modifies mPFC E/I balance to excitation via dynamic changes in eCB release which acts to induce behavioral impairment.",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
