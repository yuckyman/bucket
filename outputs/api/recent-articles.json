      "title": "Predictive Networks Generate Motion-Induced Color Illusions",
      "content": "Subjective color (SC) refers to chromatic perception induced by achromatic stimuli, as classically demonstrated using Benham's top. Despite nearly two centuries of investigation, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We developed artificial neural network (ANN) models trained on natural videos using predictive learning to investigate SC generation. These models successfully reproduced artificial subjective color (ASC) despite the absence of explicit color information in the training stimuli. Critically, ASC characteristics were systematically influenced by the colors of moving objects in the training videos. Using progressively simplified stimuli, ranging from natural scenes to 3D computer graphics to 2D animations, we demonstrated that the colors of moving objects are the primary determinant of ASC properties. We propose that predictive learning establishes color associations with motion patterns, causing the arcs on Benham's top to be perceived as moving objects with their corresponding colors. These findings suggest that cortical predictive mechanisms may complement retinal processes in generating subjective color phenomena.",

      "title": "Context-dependent benefits of training and reminders in visual skill learning",
      "content": "Previous studies using a visual texture discrimination task (TDT) have demonstrated that performance enhancements resulting from extensive daily training (full training condition) remained intact after replacing all training, except for the first and last session, with a few daily reminder trials (reminder condition). Omitting reminders (control condition) yielded only limited learning, supporting their crucial contribution. We first confirmed these findings and excluded gaze position differences among conditions as a contributing factor. Next, we tested whether the reminders effectiveness is specific to a context of limited attention to the peripheral target caused by simultaneously performing a demanding fixation task. Removing the fixation task yielded performance levels in the first session matching those normally reached after lengthy daily training, suggesting that learning in the standard TDT involves the redeployment of attention. After changing texture parameters to increase the difficulty of the task, performing the TDT without a fixation task yielded learning in all three conditions. This indicates that in a dual-task, reminders can produce learning outcomes comparable to full training. In contrast, when the TDT is performed with full attention to the target, consolidation of the initial session alone can yield improvements equivalent to those observed in reminder and full training conditions.",

      "title": "MyeliMAP: Studying Oligodendrocyte Function in Brain Networks",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia of the central nervous system (CNS), essential for rapid signal propagation, metabolic support, and neuronal health. While rodent-based cultures and organoid systems have provided insights into oligodendrocyte biology, they fall short of capturing human-specific features of myelination or integrating structural and functional readouts. Here, we present MyeliMAP (Myelination MAPping), a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) -derived microphysiological and electrophysiological platform that enables robust modeling of CNS myelination. The system combines inducible hPSC-derived neurons and oligodendrocytes in a custom-engineered microfluidic microstructure designed to mimic the developing brain microenvironment, promoting spatially organized axon-glia interactions and controlled myelin sheath formation. Within six weeks, we demonstrate myelin formation and maturation by immunofluorescence and ultrastructural validation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confirming compact multilayered wrapping of human axons. Importantly, the microstructure is directly integrated with a high-density microelectrode array (HD-MEA), enabling real-time, long-term functional assessment of network activity and myelin-dependent changes in signal conduction. This allowed us to demonstrate that oligodendrocyte-based myelinated neurons display enhanced conduction velocity of action potentials compared to neuron monocultures. Moreover, the presence of oligodendrocytes stabilized the temporal neuronal network activity by reducing variability in firing patterns and enhancing synchrony across the culture. This dual structure-function approach surpasses static end-point analyses by coupling morphological validation with dynamic, quantitative measurements of maturing circuit physiology. MyeliMAP provides a reproducible, human-relevant platform to dissect neuron-glia interactions and accelerate discovery of remyelination-promoting strategies for CNS disease.",

      "title": "Exercise remodels hippocampal extracellular matrix to alleviate chondroitin-4-sulphate-induced memory impairment.",
      "content": "Research utilising exercise therapeutically to enhance neuroplasticity mainly reports enhanced expression of neurotrophic (neural growth) factors which are associated with increased neurogenesis, structural changes, and improved memory. However, these neural changes are tightly regulated by both promotors and inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and the effect of exercise on inhibitory pathways is currently understudied. We show that exercise also modulates inhibitors of neuroplasticity. Six weeks of treadmill training reduced the gene expression of aggrecan, a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG), and altered the composition of CSPG containing structures, perineuronal nets, in the rodent hippocampus. Genetically manipulating chondroitin-4-sulphation of CSPGs by overexpressing hippocampal Chst11 impaired memory performance, which was mitigated by treadmill training. We provide evidence that hippocampal CSPGs are involved in object recognition memory, and that there is a link between exercise, modulating hippocampal inhibitors of neuroplasticity, and memory performance.",

      "content": "Affective empathy is defined as individual percept and respond to another emotion appropriately, an essential building block for human society. Historically, aberrant empathy was considered as major characteristics of autistic individuals but recently it has been challenged. It required mechanistic understanding of the empathy process, especially how autistic individual percept other emotion. By evaluating the social fear transfer response, we reported a critical role of Shank3 gene, one of the most replicated causative autism genes, in cortico-amygdala circuit in balancing and integrating affective empathy process using preclinical mouse models. We found that Shank3 knock-out mouse exhibited unexpected exaggerated affective responses, which was encoded by defective neural dynamics of Shank3-deficient cingulate projecting amygdala circuit. This work for the first time showcased an interplay between gene and affective empathy responses in mouse and laid the groundwork for modeling emapthy in autism and other neuropsychiatric disease.",

      "title": "Rho signaling promotes cell excitability and synaptic transmission",
      "content": "Gq signaling through Trio RhoGEF and Phospholipase C effectors promotes neurotransmitter release at synapses. Whether activated Rho and Phospholipase C signaling acts through shared or independent pathways remains unclear. We use the egg-laying circuit of C. elegans, which is regulated positively by Gq signaling and negatively by Go signaling, to determine the role of Rho GTPase in G-protein regulation of neural circuit excitability. We previously showed that Trio signals in both the presynaptic Hermaphrodite-Specific command Neurons (HSNs) and the postsynaptic egg-laying vulval muscles they innervate to promote egg laying. Here we show that its effector Rho similarly signals both pre- and post-synaptically. Expression of constitutively active Rho-1(G14V) in either the HSNs or vulval muscles increased their Ca2+ activity and stimulated egg laying. Conversely, reducing Rho signaling in the HSNs via expression of Rho-1(T19N) or C3 transferase expression inhibited HSN Ca2+ activity and egg laying. Animals lacking Rho function in HSN still had vulval muscle Ca2+ activity that supported contraction and egg release, although this Ca2+ activity lacked the enhancement associated with HSN neurotransmitter release, suggesting it was largely driven by stretch-dependent feedback. Together, these results show that Rho signals in both the HSNs and vulval muscles to promote excitability and egg laying.",

      "content": "Memory expression fluctuates even in response to identical cues, suggesting that ongoing brain states bias memory accessibility. However, the cellular and circuit principles governing these state-dependent fluctuations remain unclear. Here, we show that spontaneous pre-cue activity of histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamic tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) modulates the expression of reward-associative memory in mice. TMN histaminergic activity exhibited infraslow dynamics (0.05-0.1 Hz) that closely tracked an integrated brain-body state. Closed-loop cue delivery during high histaminergic states enhanced memory expression. Brief optogenetic activation or inhibition of these neurons before the cue bidirectionally modulated memory expression, and direct activation of histaminergic terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) was sufficient to enhance memory expression. Furthermore, histaminergic inhibition before the cue impaired the cue-evoked BLA population response. Thus, ongoing histaminergic activity exerts an infraslow, state-setting influence that primes BLA circuits for robust cue responses, and in turn, modulates moment-to-moment memory accessibility.",

      "title": "Decoding hidden goal-directed navigational states and their neuronal representations using a novel labyrinth paradigm and probabilistic modeling framework",
      "content": "Goal-directed navigation involves a sequence of planned actions aimed at achieving long-term goals through reinforcement, but detecting hidden states that support this process and their neuronal substrates remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we developed a complex labyrinth test that mimics naturalistic foraging and implemented a novel hierarchical probabilistic modeling framework, Cognitive Mapping of Planned Actions with State Spaces (CoMPASS). This framework infers a nested state structure, comprising short-term surveillance and ambulation states (Level 1) and long-term goal-oriented navigational states (Level 2). Using CoMPASS, we show that successful navigation in wild-type mice is marked by increased recruitment of both surveillance and goal-oriented states specifically at decision nodes, revealing how sequential behavioral decisions culminate in long-term goals. In contrast, the humanized AppSAA mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibited navigational impairments marked by diminished surveillance during decisions, reduced goal-directed states, and increased navigation stochasticity. Importantly, we show that gamma oscillations in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a region involved in spatial navigation planning, encode these CoMPASS behavioral states and their dynamic operating modes linking spatial locations to long-term goals. Our findings provide a novel paradigm for assessing hidden goal-directed navigational states and identify gamma oscillations in the PPC as their neural substrates.",

      "title": "Simultaneous stomach-brain electrophysiology reveals dynamic coupling in human sleep",
      "content": "Sleep involves continuous communication between the brain and body, yet the dynamics of peripheral signals during human sleep remain poorly understood. Here we tested whether gastric electrophysiology exhibits infraslow structure and coordinated fluctuations with cortical rhythms indicative of sleep physiology. Simultaneous high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and electrogastrography (EGG) were recorded across sixty participants and three nights. Gastric power was consistently higher during NREM than REM sleep and declined across successive cycles, consistent with stage-dependent autonomic modulation of visceral activity. For the first time, we show that the gastric rhythm itself exhibits intrinsic infraslow amplitude modulations (~0.007 Hz), which are selectively amplified during NREM sleep and temporally aligned with infraslow fluctuations in cortical sigma power, strongest during N3 sleep. Event-locked analyses further revealed transient increases in gastric amplitude following cortical slow wave oscillations, particularly when accompanied by sleep spindles. Across nights, variance in gastric infraslow amplitude predicted subjective sleep quality beyond standard polysomnographic and cardiac measures. Together, these findings position the human stomach as a peripheral oscillator whose infraslow dynamics track thalamocortical activity during sleep and predict subjective sleep quality, extending the interoceptive regulatory loop into the sleeping brain.",

      "content": "A central challenge in overcoming diseases resulting from defects in the cellular nanoscale multiprotein porosome complexes, is the consequent alteration of other proteins within the complex. By exploiting the distinct porosomes present in different tissues, Porosome Therapeutics, Inc., has developed a clinically relevant approach to incorporate (reconstitute) functional wild type porosomes into the plasma membrane of diseased cells to overcome secretory defects. In a combinatorial strategy of reprogramming the neuronal secretory and metabolic components, we established a dual-target therapeutic framework that repairs synaptic and metabolic defects to counteract neurodegeneration in Alzheimers. Utilizing iPSC derived human brain organoids, as recommended by the NIH and FDA, we demonstrate both the morphological and functional reversal of Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin treatment. Using the UHD-CMOS-MEA System developed jointly by Sony Semiconductor Solutions (Sony), SCREEN Holdings (SCREEN) and VitroVo, we were able to monitor thousands of neuronal firing in the brain organoids, helping in assessing the restoration of neuronal function in Alzheimers following porosome-apigenin therapy.",

      "content": "Neuronal populations in primary visual cortex adjust their responses to the statistical structure of the environment, including both stimulus contrast and the probability of occurrence of visual patterns. Here we show that, across a wide range of adaptation states, the distribution of population responses is well described by a zero-inflated log-normal model with three parameters: the probability of \"silence\" P0, the log-response mean , and its variance {sigma}2. Adaptation produces coordinated changes in P0 and , whereas {sigma}2 remains approximately invariant. These coordinated shifts collapse the family of response distributions onto a one-dimensional manifold, consistent with the existence of a common gain mechanism underlying both contrast and pattern adaptation. We further demonstrate that  obeys power-law relationships with stimulus contrast and with orientation probability, and that P0 varies linearly with . Finally, we show that these empirical relations arise naturally in a population of linear-nonlinear neurons driven by Gaussian inputs whose mean, but not variance, is modulated by the environment. Together, these results suggest that contrast and pattern adaptation rely on a shared mechanism that adjusts the mean input to cortical populations while preserving the overall structure of their response distribution.",

      "title": "The retinal light response is modulated by an mGluR5-mediated retrograde signal from ON-bipolar cells to photoreceptors",
      "content": "The ON visual pathway is initiated by the deactivation of mGluR6, coupled to the opening of TRPM1 channels in retinal ON-bipolar cell dendrites. Here, we show that a second metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, is localized with TRPM1 and mGluR6 in the dendrites of ON-bipolar cells. To examine the function of mGluR5, we performed electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and found that the amplitude of the b-wave, which is primarily a measure of ON-bipolar cell light-driven activity, is reduced in mGluR5 knock-out mice compared to wild type. In the mGluR5-/- retina, we observed weaker mGluR6 immunofluorescence in the dendritic tips of ON-bipolar cells that could explain the smaller ERG b-wave. To observe the effect of mGluR5 without perturbing mGluR6 expression, wild type mice were injected with MTEP, an allosteric antagonist of mGluR5. MTEP increased the amplitude of the b-wave in response to dim stimuli and caused an inflection in the intensity-response plot for flashes in the mesopic range. In the brain, postsynaptic mGluR5 regulates presynaptic glutamate release via endocanabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Therefore, we tested the effect of the CB1 receptor antagonist, SR1417A, on the ERG and found that the b-wave was affected as by MTEP, including an inflection in the intensity-response. We further showed that the CB1 receptor agonist, ACEA, reversed the effects of MTEP. Together, our results indicate that mGluR5 plays a role in gain-control at the photoreceptor to ON-bipolar cell synapses, likely via an endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde feedback.",

      "title": "Identification of gingipains in glioblastoma tumors and evidence that P. gingivalis infection drives IL-6 and PD-L1 expression in glioma cells",
      "content": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor that accounts for approximately 60% of all gliomas and 48% of primary central nervous system malignancies, is incurable and poorly understood, with a median survival of only 15 months after diagnosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand GBM pathogenesis in order to develop an effective treatment. Recent research has revealed frequent Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brains of patients with GBM, i.e., amyloid beta (A{beta}) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), indicating that GBM and AD may share some unknown environmental risk. Since chronic periodontitis (CP), and specifically Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), a keystone bacterial pathogen in CP, have emerged as risk factors for both AD and GBM, we investigated whether P. gingivalis gingipain virulence factors could be identified in GBM tissue samples and whether P. gingivalis infection affects glioma cell behavior. Using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (70 GBM cores from 35 patients; 34 cerebral tissue cores from 17 patients), we quantified the presence of arginine-gingipain B (RgpB) and lysine-gingipain (Kgp) antigens. Both gingipains showed significantly elevated staining in GBM samples compared to controls (**p < .01, ****p < .0001, respectively), with Kgp levels notably higher than RgpB within GBM tissue (****p < .0001). In functional assays using U251 glioma cells, P. gingivalis infection induced robust, dose-dependent IL-6 secretion (peaking at MOI 5), increased PD-L1 expression by 30% (*p = .036), and significantly enhanced cell invasiveness (**p < .01) in a viability-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that P. gingivalis gingipains are present at elevated levels in GBM tissue and that P. gingivalis infection reprograms glioma cells to adopt an immunosuppressive, invasive phenotype through upregulation of the IL-6/PD-L1 axis, suggesting a potential microbial contribution to GBM pathogenesis and immune evasion.",
