      "title": "A study on the dreams of Miao and Han college students in Guizhou Province.",
      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Standardized brain and plasma EV enrichment pipeline validated for Single sample multi-Omic and fatty acids applications in Mouse and Human",
      "content": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication, yet their molecular profiles across tissues and species remain poorly characterized, particularly due to currently available methods requiring a large amount of biological material (tissue or biofluids). Here, we established a workflow allowing the deep phenotyping of EV cargos starting from single samples of human and mouse origin. We took advantage of standardised EV isolation procedures and multi-omic techniques for the isolation and analysis of EVs from brain and plasma of human and mouse, integrating flow cytometric profiling, proteomics, miRNA sequencing, and fatty acid profiling. Here we report specific brain-derived EVs proteome, enriched in neuronal and glial proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids profiles, and distinct miRNAs. At the periphery, we also report plasma-derived EVs signatures reflecting immune, metabolic, and systemic transport functions. Despite these expected material-specific differences, EVs from the same source displayed greater similarity across species than EVs from different material, supporting the translational relevance of mouse models. Importantly, using state-of-the-art miRNA profiling approach, we identified novel EV-specific miRNAs in human and mouse brain EVs, potentially allowing the exploration of new roles in neuronal signalling. Overall, we report here a method enabling deep multi-omic characterization from minimal starting material, offering a practical approach for studies with limited biological samples. These findings also demonstrate that the origin strongly shapes EV composition, highlighting conserved and species-specific molecular features, and provide a scalable framework for multi-omic investigations of EV biology.",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.
