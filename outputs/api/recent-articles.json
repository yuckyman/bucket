      "content": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is parasomnia characterized by the loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting behaviors that often manifest as complex, violent motor activity. While RBD may occur idiopathically, it is frequently associated with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly \u03b1-synucleinopathies such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, secondary RBD linked to acute cerebrovascular events remains poorly documented. Here, we present a novel case of acute pontine infarction precipitating RBD, highlighting the brainstem\u2019s critical role in REM sleep regulation and expanding the spectrum of secondary RBD etiologies. This case report underscores the importance of neuroanatomical localization in evaluating acute-onset RBD, particularly in the context of cerebrovascular pathology.",

      "title": "Dynamic graph neural networks for UAV-based group activity recognition in structured team sports",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

      "title": "Toward accurate single image sand dust removal by utilizing uncertainty-aware neural network",
      "content": "Although deep learning methods have made significant strides in single image sand dust removal, the heterogeneous uncertainty induced by dusty environments poses a considerable challenge. In response, our research presents a novel framework known as the Hierarchical Interactive Uncertainty-aware Network (HIUNet). HIUNet leverages Bayesian neural networks for the extraction of robust shallow features, bolstered by pre-trained encoders for feature extraction and the agility of lightweight decoders for preliminary image reconstitution. Subsequently, a feature frequency selection mechanism is activated to enhance overall performance by strategically identifying and retaining valuable features while effectively suppressing redundant and irrelevant ones. Following this, a feature enhancement module is applied to the preliminary restoration. This intricate fusion culminates in the production of a restored image of superior quality. Our extensive experiments, using our proposed Sand11K dataset that exhibits various levels of degradation from dust and sand, confirm the effectiveness and soundness of our proposed method. By modeling uncertainty via Bayesian neural networks to extract robust shallow features and selecting valuable features through frequency selection, HIUNet can reconstruct high-quality clean images. For future work, we plan to extend our uncertainty-aware framework to handle extreme sand scenarios.",

      "title": "Probing the roles of developmentally active neurons, in early-life adversity induced disruptions of adult behaviors",
      "content": "Early life adversity (ELA) is associated with subsequent mental health problems, and animal studies provide evidence for a causal role of ELA in the risk for mental illness, including persistent brain changes at molecular, cellular, network and functional levels. As enduring changes in cell function depend on orchestrated expression of genes, a robust body of research has focused on identifying the specific epigenetic and transcriptional programs through which ELA might induce brain changes. These studies have highlighted that the effects of ELA vary by brain region, cell-types and sex. Yet, while major advances were made in the past decade, the precise mechanisms through which ELA shapes the maturation and function of brain cells and their incorporation into circuits remain incompletely understood. Here, we discuss human and animal studies that focus on ELA-induced changes of the epigenome and transcriptome and explore recent technological advances that allow visualization and manipulation of neurons activated during ELA, at later stages of life. One such technology, Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP), enables precise and permanent genetic access to cells activated during specific sensitive developmental periods. Coupled with the appropriate tools, TRAP can be used to identify cellular transcriptional programs that are altered by the ELA experience in specific cell types and circuits, impacting cognitive and emotional brain functions enduringly. Understanding how ELA changes gene expression, circuit integration and function of neurons that are engaged by ELA will advance our understanding of the mechanisms employed by ELA to heighten the risk for mental illness later in life.",

      "title": "Differential susceptibility to prenatal stress exposure in serotonin transporter-deficient female mice\u2014an epigenetic exploration",
      "content": "IntroductionEarly-life stress exposure has been linked to an increased risk for the onset of mental disorders. As another factor, an individual\u2019s genetic make-up may also tip the scale towards health or disease, with certain genetic variants mediating differential susceptibility towards the effects of early-life stress or other experiences. The current study investigated the molecular foundation of individual variation in the response to prenatal stress (PS) exposure in wildtype mice as well as in mice deficient for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) transporter (5-HTT).MethodsTo meet this end, wildtype C57BL6/J dams were mated with 5-Htt+/- C57BL6/J males, after which they were exposed to restraint stress during the last part of gestation. In adulthood, female 5-HTT-deficient PS offspring and their wildtype littermates as well as age-matched control groups completed a behavioural test-battery, after which gene expression and histone 3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) enrichment, as a marker of epigenetic programming, were measured in hippocampal tissue.ResultsDependent on the 5-Htt genotype, PS offspring showed decreased social behaviour in the 3-chamber sociability test. Notably, we observed a considerable degree of behavioural variation in the observed effect of PS in this social test, which allowed segregation into socially affected (SA) and socially unaffected (SU) mice. Genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of hippocampal tissue revealed a core set of 23 genes to be associated with genotype-specific variation in social behaviour following PS exposure. Whereas H3K4me3 levels did not show profound global changes in relation to the variable effects of PS exposure on social behaviour, the kinesin family member 14 (Kif14) gene, which displayed increased expression in socially unaffected wildtype mice, did show lower levels of H3K4me3 in those same mice, but not in any of the other groups.DiscussionAll in all, differential susceptibility linked to PS exposure displayed 5-Htt genotype-dependent behavioural and transcriptomic profiles, supporting the notion of 5-HT-dependent developmental programming.",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Despite hand function deficits, in this exploratory pilot study, adults with glaucoma demonstrated eye drop instillation success comparable to those without glaucoma, though with higher rates of bottle tip contact with the eye, skin, or eyelashes, suggesting an increased risk of potential eye drop bottle contamination. These findings suggest that though regular practice may help mitigate the effects of hand function deficits on the targeted activity of getting the eye drop in the...",

These structures detect sustained pressure, velocity, and vibrations, thereby facilitating nuanced environmental interactions. It is not known whether the ancestral anamniotic somatosensory system, typically lacking such structures, provides comparable tactile discrimination. Here, we investigate the...",

While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",
