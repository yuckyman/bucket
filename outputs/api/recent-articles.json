      "title": "Neuronal excitability and parameter variability in the Hodgkin-Huxley model",
      "content": "Biophysically detailed neuron models are often built as a one-way pipeline in which voltage-clamp data are reduced to a single set of best-fit channel parameters, which are then combined into a deterministic spiking model. This practice discards experimentally observed variability and obscures the mechanisms by which robustness and degeneracy arise in excitable systems. Here, we reintroduce parameter variability into the Hodgkin-Huxley model and embed uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis into model construction. We digitized sodium and potassium rate constant data from the original Hodgkin and Huxley figures and used bootstrap resampling to estimate the variability of the voltage-dependent kinetic parameters. We then propagated these uncertainty estimates through a spatially extended squid axon cable model using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. At the channel level, first-order Sobol sensitivity indices revealed that all kinetic parameters contribute to output variance in a strongly time-dependent manner, with distinct parameters controlling transient and steady-state behavior for potassium and sodium conductances. At the level of neuronal excitability, sampling hundreds of thousands of parameter sets produced a heterogeneous population of firing behaviors, including non-firing, phasic, regular, and spontaneous activity. Across stimulus amplitudes, the dominant firing mode was a single spike at stimulus onset. At the same time, the regularly firing subpopulation exhibited a broad distribution of firing rates, with a mean that matched the classic Hodgkin-Huxley prediction. In the phasic subpopulation, action potential propagation and conduction velocity varied widely yet remained consistent with experimental ranges. Finally, global sensitivity analysis during spiking shows uniformly small first-order indices but large total-order indices, indicating that excitability is primarily governed by strong interactions among parameters rather than by any single conductance or kinetic parameter. These results support a population-based view of conductance-based modeling in which biologically relevant behavior emerges from structured regions of parameter space.",

      "title": "Cognition does not automatically influence perception: Evidence from neural encoding of colours belonging to different categories",
      "content": "The firmest evidence in favour of models that posit early high-level influences of cognition on perception comes from electroencephalography (EEG). Enhanced early, pre-attentive processing of light and dark blue feature changes compared to light and dark green changes was reported in Greek speakers, who have two basic terms for 'blue' (ghalazio/ble). In the present three-experiment study, we systematically re-evaluate this evidence and test an alternative model that the early difference waves in the human EEG instead mainly reflect contrast adaptation phenomena. We use the same classical oddball paradigm presenting alternating light or dark standards and deviants that systematically differ in colour and/or luminance and chromatic contrast. We then calculate the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), a putative index of pre-attentive feature change processing and predictive coding derived from EEG data, by subtracting the activity elicited by standards from that elicited by task-irrelevant deviants. Our experiments demonstrate the following: 1) vMMN is driven by contrast adaptation, being observable only in the presence of contrast differences between the stimuli and not reliably observed for different hues of equal contrast; 2) there is no reliable difference between green- and blue-related difference waves in speakers with two basic blue colour categories, the difference waves again driven by contrast rather than their categorical content. Our findings are highly significant for the debate concerning the interface between perception and cognition, as the absence of early categorical effects speaks against models that predict Whorfian-type cognitive influences.",

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU.

      "title": "A System for Live Sorting of Neuronal Spiking Activity from Large-scale Recordings",
      "content": "Online monitoring and quantification of neural signals has tremendous value both for neurofeedback experiments and for brain-computer interfaces. Unfortunately, established methods of online monitoring primarily involve the use of thresholded neural activity rather than sorted single-neuron spikes. The recent introduction of large-scale, high-density electrophysiology has enabled the recording of activity from hundreds of neurons simultaneously in both model organisms and human participants. This development highlights the need for a robust and easily implementable system for sorting spikes during data collection for live analyses of neuronal signals. Here, we describe a system for live sorting of neuronal activity (LSS) based on the widely used Kilosort platform. The LSS workflow utilizes an initial period of recorded neural data to identify waveform templates using Kilosort. LSS then interfaces with the SpikeGLX API to retrieve small batches (e.g. 50 ms) of data and for processing online. We measured the similarity of single-neuron activity sorted live by LSS to that sorted offline in neurophysiological recordings from macaque visual cortex using Neuropixels probes. We show that LSS closely replicates the post-stimulus time histograms and visual response tuning curves of single-neurons obtained using offline sorting. Furthermore, we show that decoding neural signals online with LSS consistently outperforms online decoding of thresholded activity, and that LSS can achieve the same performance as that obtained with offline sorting.",

      "title": "The Role of Synchronization of Neural Modules in Pattern Processing inthe Visual System",
      "content": "Key operations in modeling visual processing in living systems are those that process a pattern as a holistic object, for example, in pattern recognition to ensure invariance to translation and rotation. In this article, we describe a neural module we synthesized for moving a pattern along a cortical layer without losing its shape. The module has the form of a three-layer neural network with two types of inhibitory neurons, one of which is a universal prohibition logic element. Modeling showed that such operations can be implemented using the proposed neural module by additionally synchronizing its operation using endogenous pacemakers with a gamma rhythm frequency. The mechanism of such synchronization is similar to the clock sweep mechanism in electronics. We believe we have clearly demonstrated the possible role of gamma-based brain activity as a mechanism for synchronizing computations in living neural networks for the first time. This opens up new possibilities for constructing neuromorphic architectures for real-time visual recognition.",
