      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "content": "arXiv:2512.00420v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Due to the progress in artificial intelligence, it is important to understand how capable artificial agents should be used when interacting with humans, since high level authority and responsibility often remain with the human agent. However, integrated frameworks are lacking that can account for heterogeneous agents and draw on different scientific fields, such as human-factors engineering and artificial intelligence. Therefore, joint hybrid intelligence is described as a framework abstracting humans and artificial intelligence as decision making agents. A general definition of intelligence is provided on the basis of decision making competence being applicable to agents of different sorts. This framework is used for proposing the interrelated design space of joint hybrid intelligence being aimed at integrating the heterogeneous capabilities of humans and artificial intelligence. At the core of this design space lies joint agent engineering with the goal of integrating the design subspaces operator training, artificial intelligence engineering, and interface design via developing joint agent patterns. The ''extended swarming'' approach to human-swarm interaction is discussed as an example of such a pattern.",

      "title": "Significant Other AI: Identity, Memory, and Emotional Regulation as Long-Term Relational Intelligence",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.00418v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Significant Others (SOs) stabilize identity, regulate emotion, and support narrative meaning-making, yet many people today lack access to such relational anchors. Recent advances in large language models and memory-augmented AI raise the question of whether artificial systems could support some of these functions. Existing empathic AIs, however, remain reactive and short-term, lacking autobiographical memory, identity modeling, predictive emotional regulation, and narrative coherence. This manuscript introduces Significant Other Artificial Intelligence (SO-AI) as a new domain of relational AI. It synthesizes psychological and sociological theory to define SO functions and derives requirements for SO-AI, including identity awareness, long-term memory, proactive support, narrative co-construction, and ethical boundary enforcement. A conceptual architecture is proposed, comprising an anthropomorphic interface, a relational cognition layer, and a governance layer. A research agenda outlines methods for evaluating identity stability, longitudinal interaction patterns, narrative development, and sociocultural impact. SO-AI reframes AI-human relationships as long-term, identity-bearing partnerships and provides a foundational blueprint for investigating whether AI can responsibly augment the relational stability many individuals lack today.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.00326v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Loneliness is a critical mental health issue among university students, yet traditional monitoring methods rely primarily on retrospective self-reports and often lack real-time behavioral context. This study explores the use of passive smartphone sensing data to predict loneliness levels, addressing the limitations of existing approaches in capturing its dynamic nature. We integrate smartphone sensing with machine learning and large language models respectively to develop generalized and personalized models. Our Random Forest generalized models achieved mean absolute errors of 3.29 at midterm and 3.98 (out of 32) at the end of semester on the UCLA Loneliness Scale (short form), identifying smartphone screen usage and location mobility to be key predictors. The one-shot approach leveraging large language models reduced prediction errors by up to 42% compared to zero-shot inference. The one-shot results from personalized models highlighted screen usage, application usage, battery, and location transitions as salient behavioral indicators. These findings demonstrate the potential of smartphone sensing data for scalable and interpretable loneliness detection in digital mental health.",

      "title": "The Impact of Concept Explanations and Interventions on Human-Machine Collaboration",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.00015v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often considered black boxes due to their opaque decision-making processes. To reduce their opacity Concept Models (CMs), such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), were introduced to predict human-defined concepts as an intermediate step before predicting task labels. This enhances the interpretability of DNNs. In a human-machine setting greater interpretability enables humans to improve their understanding and build trust in a DNN. In the introduction of CBMs, the models demonstrated increased task accuracy as incorrect concept predictions were replaced with their ground truth values, known as intervening on the concept predictions. In a collaborative setting, if the model task accuracy improves from interventions, trust in a model and the human-machine task accuracy may increase. However, the result showing an increase in model task accuracy was produced without human evaluation and thus it remains unknown if the findings can be applied in a collaborative setting. In this paper, we ran the first human studies using CBMs to evaluate their human interaction in collaborative task settings. Our findings show that CBMs improve interpretability compared to standard DNNs, leading to increased human-machine alignment. However, this increased alignment did not translate to a significant increase in task accuracy. Understanding the model's decision-making process required multiple interactions, and misalignment between the model's and human decision-making processes could undermine interpretability and model effectiveness.",

This study evaluated the effectiveness of cultural prompting in improving cultural responsiveness and perceived empathy of LLM-generated therapeutic responses for Chinese American family caregivers. Using a randomized controlled experiment, we compared GPT-4o and Deepseek-V3 responses with and without cultural prompting. Thirty-six participants evaluated input-response pairs on cultural responsiveness (competence and relevance) and perceived empathy. Results showed that cultural prompting significantly enhanced GPT-4o's performance across all dimensions, with GPT-4o with cultural prompting being the most preferred, while improvements in DeepSeek-V3 responses were not significant. Mediation analysis revealed that cultural prompting improved empathy through improving cultural responsiveness. This study demonstrated that prompt-based techniques can effectively enhance the cultural responsiveness of LLM-generated therapeutic responses, highlighting the importance of cultural responsiveness in delivering empathetic AI-based therapeutic interventions to culturally and linguistically diverse populations.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.00013v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Reducing wealth inequality and resource waste is a global challenge. A fundamental problem within the capitalist economy, put simply, lies in the enslavement of labor and the colonization of resources. To address these issues, movements promoting digital democracy and cooperative platforms have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional capitalist systems. From the perspective of integrating information systems with real-world social, environmental, and economic systems, Cyber-Physical Systems have been proposed for applications in Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0. One such CPS is the Social Co-OS (cyber-human social co-operating system). Social Co-OS is a co-operating system between cyber and human societies that conceptualizes the social system as a dynamic, circular structure composed of three layers: individual behavior, interindividual interaction, and institutional formation. Within this framework, the cyber system supports collective decision-making and individual cooperative behavior across these layers. The objective of this study is to define a novel application architecture based on the Social Co-OS concept, design a user interface flow, and implement it in practice. Specifically, we develop a social impact evaluator, a pluralistic policy simulator, and a consensus-building facilitator, which constitute the deliberative and political loop of Social Co-OS. Additionally, we implement a personality estimator and a behavior change promoter, which constitute the operational and administrative loop, along with a common mediator that serves as the cyber-human interface. Through these implementations, we demonstrate that Social Co-OS applications can effectively support human social systems and offer practical utility for policy co-making and co-operation, as evidenced by examples grounded in real-world challenges.",

      "title": "Leveraging LLMs for Design Ideation: An AI Tool to Assist Creativity",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.00010v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The creative potential of computers has intrigued researchers for decades. Since the emergence of Generative AI (Gen AI), computer creativity has found many new dimensions and applications. As Gen AI permeates mainstream discourse and usage, researchers are delving into how it can improve and complement what humans do. Creative potential is a highly relevant notion to design practice and research, especially in the initial stages of ideation and conceptualisation. There is scope to improve creative potential in these stages, especially using machine intelligence. We propose a structured ideation session involving inspirational stimuli and utilise Gen AI in delivering this structure to designers through ALIA: Analogical LLM Ideation Agent, a tool for small-group ideation scenarios. The tool is developed by enabling speech based interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) for inference generation. Inspiration is drawn from the synectic ideation method and the dialectics philosophy to design the optimal stimuli in group ideation. The tool is tested in design ideation sessions to compare the output of the AI-assisted ideation sessions to that of tradi tional ideation sessions. Preliminary findings showcase that participants have rated their ideas better when assisted by ALIA and respond favourably to speech-based interactions.",

      "title": "Development and Benchmarking of a Blended Human-AI Qualitative Research Assistant",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.00009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Qualitative research emphasizes constructing meaning through iterative engagement with textual data. Traditionally this human-driven process requires navigating coder fatigue and interpretative drift, thus posing challenges when scaling analysis to larger, more complex datasets. Computational approaches to augment qualitative research have been met with skepticism, partly due to their inability to replicate the nuance, context-awareness, and sophistication of human analysis. Large language models, however, present new opportunities to automate aspects of qualitative analysis while upholding rigor and research quality in important ways. To assess their benefits and limitations - and build trust among qualitative researchers - these approaches must be rigorously benchmarked against human-generated datasets. In this work, we benchmark Muse, an interactive, AI-powered qualitative research system that allows researchers to identify themes and annotate datasets, finding an inter-rater reliability between Muse and humans of Cohen's $\\kappa$ = 0.71 for well-specified codes. We also conduct robust error analysis to identify failure mode, guide future improvements, and demonstrate the capacity to correct for human bias.",

      "title": "A framework for disentangling spatial and visual neural representations",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.01962v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurons in cortical areas often integrate signals from different origins. In the primary visual cortex (V1), neural responses are modulated by non-visual context such as the animal's position. However, the spatial profile of these position signals across the environment remains unknown. Here, we propose a new framework to disentangle visual and spatial contributions in virtual reality. This method relies on two principles: 1) a virtual corridor design that decorrelates vision and space through targeted cue repetitions and manipulations and 2) a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that explicitly estimates visual contributions in retinotopic rather than environmental coordinates. In simulations, we demonstrate that this framework is highly specific (recovering spatial modulation only when present) and effectively captures the profile and weight of spatial gain fields across the environment. When applied to V1 recordings from mice navigating the virtual corridor, the model isolated significant spatial components in a substantial fraction of V1 neurons. The recovered spatial components exhibited heterogeneous, often multi-peaked, profiles. Application of this framework to large-scale recordings may provide a robust approach to characterize the nature of spatial signals modulating sensory processing across brain areas.",

      "title": "The Modeler Schema Theory of Consciousness, with a Falsifiable Experiment",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.01073v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose that consciousness arises from a single control agent, the Modeler-schema. It monitors the brain's Modeler as that system constructs and updates the internal World Model. As part of that monitoring, the Modeler-schema generates experience by applying a qualia-based consistency check to the Modeler's output. The Human Agent comprises three cooperating agents: Modeler, Controller, and Targeter, each paired with an associated regulatory \"schema\" agent. We also describe fast-Modelers and fast-Controllers; evolutionary shortcuts whose rapid actions will precede awareness. Our core prediction is that the Modeler-schema performs a qualia-based consistency check during saccades and issues a bottom-up target when a discrepancy is found. To test this prediction, we propose a saccadic change-detection experiment that distinguishes Modeler-generated from Modeler-schema-generated targets. Locating qualia in the Modeler-schema ties experience to the regulation and refinement of internal representations, clarifies how awareness arises from model control, and suggests a path toward empirical falsification, thereby offering a concrete, testable proposal toward solving the Hard Problem of consciousness.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.01058v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We investigate a conductance-based neuron model to explore how voltage-gated ion channel isoforms influence action-potential generation. The model combines a six-state Markov representation of NaV channels with a first-order KV3.1 model, allowing us to vary maximal sodium and potassium conductances and compare nine NaV isoforms. Using bifurcation theory and local stability analysis, we map regions of stable limit cycles and visualize excitability landscapes via heatmap-based diagrams. These analyses show that isoforms NaV1.3, NaV1.4 and NaV1.6 support broad excitable regimes, while isoforms NaV1.7 and NaV1.9 exhibit minimal oscillatory behavior. Our findings provide insights into the role of channel heterogeneity in neuronal dynamics and may help to guide the design of synthetic excitable systems by narrowing the parameter space needed for robust action-potential trains.",

      "title": "Symmetries at the origin of hierarchical emergence",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.00984v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many systems of interest exhibit nested emergent layers with their own rules and regularities, and our knowledge about them seems naturally organised around these levels. This paper proposes that this type of hierarchical emergence arises as a result of underlying symmetries. By combining principles from information theory, group theory, and statistical mechanics, one finds that dynamical processes that are equivariant with respect to a symmetry group give rise to emergent macroscopic levels organised into a hierarchy determined by the subgroups of the symmetry. The same symmetries happen to also shape Bayesian beliefs, yielding hierarchies of abstract belief states that can be updated autonomously at different levels of resolution. These results are illustrated in Hopfield networks and Ehrenfest diffusion, showing that familiar macroscopic quantities emerge naturally from their symmetries. Together, these results suggest that symmetries provide a fundamental mechanism for emergence and support a structural correspondence between objective and epistemic processes, making feasible inferential problems that would otherwise be computationally intractable.",
