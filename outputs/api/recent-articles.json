      "title": "Multivariate White Matter Microstructure Alterations in Older Adults with Coronary Artery Disease",
      "content": "<p>Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) face an increased risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and stroke. While white matter (WM) lesions are frequently reported in patients with CAD, the effects on WM microstructure alterations remain largely unknown. We aimed to identify WM microstructural alterations in individuals with CAD compared with healthy controls (HC) and to examine their relationships with cognitive performance. Forty-three (43) patients with CAD (35 males and 8 females) and 36 HC (26 males and 10 females) aged 50 and older underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and multimodal 3&nbsp;T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A novel multivariate approach&mdash;the Mahalanobis distance (D2)&mdash;was used to quantify WM abnormalities as the amount of deviation from the HC reference group. D2 integrates multiple MRI-derived diffusion-weighted imaging, R1 relaxometry, and magnetization transfer imaging metrics, while accounting for covariance between metrics. Relationships between WM D2 and cognition (executive function and processing speed) were also assessed. Compared with HCs, patients with CAD had higher D2 values in the whole WM (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and in the right anterior and bilateral middle cerebral artery territories (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Myelin-sensitive metrics, particularly R1 relaxation rate and MT saturation, were the most important contributors to D2. Processing speed was positively associated with greater R1 in both the whole WM and left middle cerebral artery territory. These findings suggest that greater WM microstructural alterations observed in patients with CAD were mainly driven by differences in myelin content. These alterations may contribute to a heightened risk of cognitive impairment.</p>",

      "title": "Age-Related Positivity Bias in Emotion Recognition Is Linked to Lower Cognitive Performance and Altered Amygdala-Orbitofrontal Connectivity",
      "content": "<p>Changes in emotion recognition are observed in aging, in dementia, after brain lesions and as a function of mental health factors, such as depression. In aging, older adults have been argued to show a \"positivity bias,\" which has been associated with a relatively spared recognition accuracy for positive emotion and an increased tendency to label emotions as positive. This bias has been suggested to support mental well-being. However, it has also been found in association with cognitive decline and brain lesions. Here, we investigated the behavioral and brain correlates of this age-related positivity bias. We used multimodal brain imaging in a large group of human adults (<i>n</i> = 665, 333 females) drawn from a population-derived cohort across the lifespan, together with a psychometric analysis of an emotion recognition task using facial expressions. Beyond reductions in expression recognition accuracy, older adults showed increased perceptual thresholds for negative emotions and a reduced threshold for the positive emotion, even after accounting for general face recognition abilities. This positivity bias in labeling emotions was strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in older people, but not with (nonclinical) depressive symptoms. It was also associated with reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral anterior hippocampus&ndash;amygdala and increased functional connectivity between these regions and the orbitofrontal cortex. Together, age-related positivity bias is associated with cognitive decline and structural and functional brain differences. A positivity bias in emotion recognition may therefore reflect an early marker of neurodegeneration, a hypothesis that could be tested in future longitudinal studies.</p>",

      "title": "Looking into Working Memory to Verify Potential Search Targets",
      "content": "<p>Finding what you are looking for is a ubiquitous task in everyday life that relies on a two-way comparison between what is currently viewed and internal search goals held in memory. Despite a wealth of studies tracking visual verification among external contents of perception, complementary verification processes among internal contents of memory remain elusive. Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we uncover the internal inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential search targets. We show how male and female human participants \"look back\" into working memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time needed for visual verification. A direct comparison between visual verification among the contents of working memory or perception further revealed how verification in both domains engages frontal theta activity in scalp electroencephalography but also how mnemonic verification is slower to deploy than perceptual verification. This establishes internal verification as an integral component of visual search and provides new ways to look into this underexplored component of human search behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Accelerated brain age in Moyamoya disease patients: a deep learning approach and correlation with disease severity",
      "content": "IntroductionThis study aims to utilize a DenseNet based deep learning framework to predict brain age in patients with Moyamoya disease (MMD), examining the relationship between brain age and disease severity to enhance diagnostic and prognostic capabilities.MethodsWe analyzed unenhanced MRI scans from 432 adult MMD patients and 565 normal controls collected between January 2018 and December 2022. Data preprocessing involved converting DICOM files to NIFTI format and labeling based on established diagnostic criteria. A DenseNet121 architecture, implemented using PyTorch, was employed to predict brain age. Statistical analyses included correlation assessments and comparisons between predicted brain age, chronological age, and MRA scores.ResultsThe predicted brain age for MMD patients was significantly higher than their chronological age, averaging 37.9 years versus 35.8 years (p < 0.01). For normal controls, predicted brain age matched chronological age at 36.5 years. Delta age (difference between predicted brain age and chronological age) was significantly elevated in MMD patients (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with MRA scores, indicating a link between arterial stenosis severity and accelerated brain aging.DiscussionThe DenseNet based model effectively predicts brain age, revealing that MMD patients experience accelerated brain aging correlated with disease severity. These findings highlight the potential of brain age prediction as a biomarker for MMD, aiding in personalized treatment strategies and early intervention. Future research should explore multi-center datasets and longitudinal data to validate and extend these findings.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe thalamus, along with its component nuclei, possesses extensive connections with various brain regions and is engaged in diverse functions. However, it is unknown whether the gray matter volume (GMV) covariance networks of thalamic subfields are selectively affected in chronic capsular stroke.MethodsWe recruited 45 patients with chronic right capsular strokes (CS) and 93 normal controls (NC) from three centers. The thalamus was segmented into 25 subfields using FreeSurfer (v7.1.1). A general linear model was applied to investigate intergroup differences in the GMV covariance network of each thalamic subfield with each voxel of the entire brain between CS and NC, correcting for confounders such as age, gender, total intracranial volume (TIV), and scanners (voxel-wise p\u202f<\u202f0.001, cluster-wise FWE corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ResultsOur findings revealed that all 25 ipsilesional thalamic subfields in CS were atrophied (p\u202f<\u202f0.05, FDR correction). Among these, 16 ipsilesional thalamic subfields (including AV, LD, LP, VLa, VLp, VPL, VM, CeM, CL, MDm, LGN, PuM, PuI, CM, Pf, and Pt) exhibited significantly subfield-specific increased GMV covariance connectivity with the anterior orbital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, calcarine, anterior cingulate cortex, precentral gyrus, and other regions. Additionally, although none of the contralesional thalamic subfields demonstrated regional GMV changes, 3/25 showed subfield-specific increased GMV covariance connectivity with the ipsilesional anterior orbital gyrus and subcortex.ConclusionThe GMV covariance networks of thalamic subfields are selectively involved in patients with chronic capsular stroke, which affect not only the ipsilesional thalamic subfields but also the contralesional ones.",

      "title": "Efficient spiking convolutional neural networks accelerator with multi-structure compatibility",
      "content": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) possess excellent computational energy efficiency and biological credibility. Among them, Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) have significantly improved performance, demonstrating promising applications in low-power and brain-like computing. To achieve hardware acceleration for SCNNs, we propose an efficient FPGA accelerator architecture with multi-structure compatibility. This architecture supports both traditional convolutional and residual topologies, and can be adapted to diverse requirements from small networks to complex networks. This architecture uses a clock-driven scheme to perform convolution and neuron updates based on the spike-encoded image at each timestep. Through hierarchical pipelining and channel parallelization strategies, the computation speed of SCNNs is increased. To address the issue of current accelerators only supporting simple network, this architecture combines configuration and scheduling methods, including grouped reuse computation and line-by-line multi-timestep computation to accelerate deep networks with lots of channels and large feature map sizes. Based on the proposed accelerator architecture, we evaluated two scales of networks, named small-scale LeNet and deep residual SCNN, for object detection. Experiments show that the proposed accelerator achieves a maximum recognition speed of 1, 605 frames/s at a 100 MHz clock for the LeNet network, consuming only 0.65 mJ per image. Furthermore, the accelerator, combined with the proposed configuration and scheduling methods, achieves acceleration for each residual module in the deep residual SCNN, reaching a processing speed of 2.59 times that of the CPU with a power consumption of only 16.77% of the CPU. This demonstrates that the proposed accelerator architecture can achieve higher energy efficiency, compatibility, and wider applicability.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a leading neurodegenerative disorder, presents significant global health challenges. Advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising tools for analyzing multimodal neuroimaging data to improve AD diagnosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of GNN applications in AD diagnosis, focusing on data sources, modalities, sample sizes, classification tasks, and diagnostic performance. Drawing on extensive literature searches across PubMed, IEEE Xplorer, Scopus, and Springer, we analyze key GNN frameworks and critically evaluate their limitations, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. In addition, we present a comparative analysis to evaluate the generalizability and robustness of GNN methods across different datasets, such as ADNI, OASIS, TADPOLE, UK Biobank, in-house, etc. Furthermore, we provide a critical methodological comparison across families of GNN architectures (i.e., GCN, ChebNet, GraphSAGE, GAT, GIN, etc.) in the context of AD. Finally, we outline future research directions to refine GNN-based diagnostic methods and highlight their potential role in advancing AI-driven neuroimaging solutions. Our findings aim to foster the integration of AI technologies in neurodegenerative disease research and clinical practice.",

      "content": "BackgroundFunctional stability within brain networks, particularly the sensorimotor network (SMN), is crucial for coherent motor control. Temporal Interference (TI) stimulation offers a non-invasive method to modulate deep brain structures like the striatum, yet its impact on dynamic functional stability across motor networks remains largely unexplored.MethodsTwenty-six healthy male participants separately underwent TI stimulation and Sham stimulation in a crossover, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with counterbalanced protocol. resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was acquired before and during the stimulation. A total of 20 min TI stimulation (10 mA, \u0394f = 20 Hz) was applied to the right striatum using personalized electrode montages optimized. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) was computed using a sliding-window approach. Voxel-wise functional stability across the whole brain was quantified by Kendall\u2019s concordance coefficient of voxel-to-voxel dFC. Seed-based dFC variability in the right striatum was measured as the standard deviation of dFC across windows.Results(1) Functional stability: TI stimulation significantly decreased functional stability in bilateral SMA regions (predominantly SMA proper, with parts of pre-SMA) compared to Sham and baseline conditions (P < 0.01). (2) Dynamic functional connectivity: TI stimulation reduced dFC variability between the right striatum and left SMA region (predominantly SMA proper, with parts of pre-SMA) compared to baseline (P < 0.01). (3) Safety: No adverse cognitive effects or side effects were observed, with good blinding effectiveness maintained throughout the study.ConclusionOur findings indicate that TI stimulation targeting the striatum effectively modulates sensorimotor network stability and dFC variability within the cortico-striatal pathway, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach for motor network disorders.Clinical trial registration[www.chictr.org.cn;], identifier [ChiCTR2500098699].",

      "title": "From zero- to few-shot: deep temporal learning of wrist EMG enables scalable cross-user gesture recognition",
      "content": "Objective. Wrist electromyography (EMG) is emerging as an enticing wearable input modality for human\u2013machine interaction. Traditionally recorded from the forearm for use in transradial prostheses, wrist-based EMG sensors are now being integrated into devices such as watches and wristbands for hand gesture recognition (HGR). Consumer familiarity with wrist-worn devices makes wrist EMG a compelling option, but the need for individualized user calibration remains a challenge. Approach. This study therefore evaluated various cross-user models to reduce the calibration burden and compared wrist- and forearm-based models. Eight different machine learning architectures were evaluated across 33 users, using varying amounts of data from the end user. Main results. A temporal convolutional network-bidirectional long short-term memory architecture, applied for the first time to EMG classification, was found to significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) outperform other tested machine learning architectures. An inter-day feature set combined with Z-score normalization achieved the best performance when classifying five gestures (plus a rest class) using either wrist or forearm EMG. Consistent with other recent results, wrist EMG consistently outperformed forearm EMG in all analyses, including within- and across-user comparisons (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In cross-user models, wrist EMG demonstrated a zero-shot performance of 78.2%, compared to 71.6% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Introducing one calibration repetition from the end user increased one-shot performance of wrist EMG to 91.6%, compared to 86.9% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Adding further training repetitions boosted wrist EMG performance to 98.3%, compared to 97.4% for forearm EMG. Significance. These findings provide new evidence supporting the viability of wrist EMG for cross-user HGR models that generalize to new users with minimal calibration, suggesting promising potential for its broader adoption in wearable devices.",

      "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease is related to imbalanced stopping-related cortical activity",
      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
