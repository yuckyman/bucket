      "title": "m6A modification and prion-like domain proteins converge to dysregulate Neuronal RNA Granules in Alzheimer s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer s disease (AD) is a deadly neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. It is associated with several dysregulated pathways, including axonal transport. The latter supplies synapses with several essential components, including proteins and mRNAs. A proportion of RNAs in neurons is transported from the soma to neuronal extensions along microtubules in highly organized structures, known as Neuronal RNA Granules (NRGs). NRGs have a heterogeneous composition of coding and non-coding RNAs, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and components of translational machinery. In this study, we investigate the potential involvement of NRGs in AD pathogenesis, with a particular focus on the N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a key RNA modification, and prion-like domain (PrLD) proteins. Our in-silico analysis revealed that a significant portion of mRNAs in NRGs are likely to be highly methylated. Using transcriptomic data from AD brain, we identify dysregulation of key genes in the m6A-methylation pathway (METTL3, FTO, YTHDF2/3, eIF3m) as well as PrLD-containing proteins associated with NRGs (STAU2, YBX1). We further observe aberrant expression of m6A-methylated mRNAs within both NRGs and synapses. Gene Ontology analysis highlights disruptions in pathways related to NRGs and synaptic function. Together, our findings suggest that impaired NRGs homeostasis may represent a critical and previously underappreciated contributor to AD pathogenesis. By outlining the potential roles of m6A and PrLD proteins in regulating NRGs, this work offers a new conceptual framework to better understand AD and identify NRGs as a potential therapeutic target. Finally, we propose a working model illustrating how dysregulation of NRGs homeostasis may drive neurodegeneration in AD.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I've been working on a project called Dorsal for the last 18 months. It's a way to make unstructured data more queryable and organized, without having to upload files to a cloud bucket or pay for remote compute (my CPU/GPU can almost always handle my workloads).</p> <h1>What my Project Does</h1> <p>Dorsal is a Python library and CLI for generating, validating and managing structured file metadata. It scans files locally to generate validated JSON-serializable records. I personally use it for deduplicating files, adding annotations (structured metadata records) and organizing files by tags.</p> <ul> <li>Core Extraction: Out of the box, it extracts &quot;universal&quot; metadata (Name, Hashes, Media Type; things any file has), as well and format-specific values (e.g., document page counts, video resolution, ebook titles/authors).</li> <li>The Toolkit: It provides the scaffolding to build and plug in your own complex extraction models (like OCR, classification, or entity extraction, where the input is a file). It handles the pipeline execution, dependency management, and file I/O for you.</li> <li>Strict Validation: It enforces Pydantic/JSON Schema on all outputs. If your custom extractor returns a float where a string is expected, Dorsal catches it before it pollutes your index.</li> </ul> <p>Example: a simple custom model for checking PDF files for sensitive words:</p> <pre><code>from dorsal import AnnotationModel from dorsal.file.helpers import build_classification_record from dorsal.file.preprocessing import extract_pdf_text SENSITIVE_LABELS = { &quot;Confidential&quot;: [&quot;confidential&quot;, &quot;do not distribute&quot;, &quot;private&quot;], &quot;Internal&quot;: [&quot;internal use only&quot;, &quot;proprietary&quot;], } class SensitiveDocumentScanner(AnnotationModel): id: str = &quot;github:dorsalhub/annotation-model-examples&quot; version: str = &quot;1.0.0&quot; def main(self) -&gt; dict | None: try: pages = extract_pdf_text(self.file_path) except Exception as err: self.set_error(f&quot;Failed to parse PDF: {err}&quot;) return None matches = set() for text in pages: text = text.lower() for label, keywords in SENSITIVE_LABELS.items(): if any(k in text for k in keywords): matches.add(label) return build_classification_record( labels=list(matches), vocabulary=list(SENSITIVE_LABELS.keys()) ) </code></pre> <p>^ This can be easily integrated into a locally-run linear pipeline, and executed via either the command line (by pointing at a file or directory) or in a python script.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li>ML Engineers / Data Scientists: Dorsal lets you make sure all of your output steps are validated, using a set of robust schemas for many common data engineering tasks (regression, entity extraction, classification etc.).</li> <li>Data Hoarders / Archivists: People with massive local datasets (TB+) who like customizable tools for deduplication, tagging and even cloud querying</li> <li>RAG Pipeline Builders: Turn folders of PDFs and docs into structured JSON chunks for vector embeddings</li> </ul> <h1>Links</h1> <ul> <li>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/dorsalhub/dorsal\">https://github.com/dorsalhub/dorsal</a></li> <li>PyPI: pip install dorsalhub</li> <li>Docs: <a href=\"https://docs.dorsalhub.com\">https://docs.dorsalhub.com</a></li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Feature</th> <th align=\"left\">Dorsal</th> <th align=\"left\">Cloud ETL (AWS/GCP)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Integrity</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Hash-based</td> <td align=\"left\">Upload required</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Validation</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">JSON Schema / Pydantic</td> <td align=\"left\">API Dependent</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Cost</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Free (Local Compute)</td> <td align=\"left\">$$$ (Per Page)</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\"><strong>Workflow</strong></td> <td align=\"left\">Standardized Pipeline</td> <td align=\"left\">Vendor Lock-in</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Any and all feedback is extremely welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AverageMechUser\"> /u/AverageMechUser </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qi3zwa/i_built_a_localfirst_file_metadata_extraction/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qi3zwa/i_built_a_localfirst_file_metadata_extraction/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Phase similarity between similar objects indicates representational merging across retrieval training but not sleep",
      "content": "Retrieval training (i.e., cued recall) is theorised to induce rapid memory consolidation, similarly to sleep. Across consolidation, related neural representations become increasingly similar; yet, this representational change has never been directly compared between sleep and retrieval training. In this study, 30 subjects (27F, 18-34, M=22.17) completed four separate sessions in which they (1) learnt object-word pairs, followed by (2) immediate recognition testing, (3) one of four 120-min interventions (retrieval training, restudy, sleep, or wake), and (4) delayed recognition testing. We compared EEG phase similarity between similar and different objects to assess the time, frequency, and anatomical distribution of representational similarity across encoding (learning to immediate recognition), and each intervention (immediate to delayed recognition). We hypothesised that EEG phase patterns for similar objects would become more similar (i.e., representational merging) across retrieval training and sleep interventions, and predict a greater endorsement of similar-object lures. Indeed, we found increased representational similarity between similar objects across the encoding shift in the theta-band and occipital sources. Crucially, additional representational merging was only observed across the retrieval training intervention, in the alpha-band and parieto-occipital sources. Despite retrieval training leading to reduced performance in discriminating similar-objects lures, greater representational merging across retrieval training predicted greater discrimination of similar-object lures. Together, these findings suggest that sleep and retrieval training induce different memory transformations across the same timescale. Retrieval training may generally provoke rapid gist extraction, with greater neocortical integration supporting episodic discrimination. Conversely, sleep may selectively maintain task-relevant episodic and semantic details in the short-term.",
