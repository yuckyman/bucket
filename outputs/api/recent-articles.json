      "title": "Multivariate environmental exposures are reflected in whole-brain functional connectivity and cognition in youth",
      "content": "Each individual's complex, multidimensional environment, known as their 'exposome', plays an essential role in shaping cognitive neurodevelopment. Understanding the mechanisms whereby children's exposome influences their development is crucial to facilitate the design of interventions to foster positive developmental trajectories for all youth. Recent work has identified a general exposome factor associated with socio-economic inequality that is strongly related to cognition and individual differences in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in youth. Building on these findings, the current study explores whether alterations in functional connectivity may represent a potential mechanism linking variation in the exposome to cognitive performance. We apply a data-driven, cross-validated, whole-brain machine learning approach, connectome-based statistical inference, to identify patterns of functional connectivity associated with exposome scores among early adolescents enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study using data collected during three cognitive tasks and during rest. Additionally, we investigate whether the identified patterns of functional connectivity relate to individual differences in cognitive performance across three domains: General Cognition, Executive Functioning, and Learning/Memory. Models incorporating 10-fold cross-validation over 100 iterations identified consistent functional connections associated with the exposome across task and rest conditions (model performance: ns = 6,137-8,391, rs = 0.34 - 0.44, ps <.001). Results were robust across data collection sites and functional connections common across all significant models were associated with cognitive performance across domains (ps < 0.0009). Collectively, these findings reveal that multidimensional environmental exposures are reflected in patterns of functional connectivity and relate to cognitive functioning among youth.",

      "title": "Inhibition of oxytocin neurons during key periods of development has long-term behavioural and body composition effects",
      "content": "Oxytocin (OT) is a neuromodulator of social behaviour in mammals and accumulative data support the concept of a critical period for OT action during infancy. However, it is possible that the specific functions of OT depend on different time periods of action. In this study, we aimed to determine whether there are developmental stages during which OT-expressing neurons play a decisive role with long-term consequences. To this end, we chemogenetically inhibited OT-expressing neurons during three critical periods of development (in infants, juveniles, and young adults) in male and female mice, followed by a longitudinal study to assess behaviour and metabolic perturbations. The most pronounced behavioural effects are observed after inhibition during infancy in both sexes. Notably, social memory is consistently impaired in males, regardless of the inactivation period. From a metabolic perspective, in adulthood, an increase in body weight is observed in all cohorts of males but fat mass and adipocyte size increase after inhibition of OT-expressing neurons during juvenile period. In addition, we observed a significant delay in the day of birth and an alteration in feeding behaviour in neonates after inhibiting OT-expressing neurons around the time of birth. Thus, inhibition of OT neurons during three postnatal periods has direct, distinct, and long-lasting consequences on social behaviour and metabolism, depending on the sex and on the timing of inactivation. Our results also demonstrate a role of foetal/neonate oxytocin neurons in the timing of birth and in early feeding behaviour.",

      "title": "Expansion of Working Memory Capacity Supports Early Skill Learning",
      "content": "Real-world motor skills depend on the precise spatiotemporal coordination of action sequences refined through practice. Working memory, which transiently maintains and manipulates task-relevant information, supports skill acquisition expanding with extensive training, as shown in expert domains such as in master chess players. Yet, the temporal dynamics of working memory emergence and expansion during the rapid performance gains that define early skill learning remain unclear. We addressed this question across three experiments in which participants learned various naturalistic sequential keypress skills. Within each practice trial, we observed segments of high-initial-skill (HIS)--transient periods of elevated performance followed by skill drops--that persisted throughout training. The keypress content of HIS segments scaled with execution speed and systematically increased with practice, reflecting an expansion of keypress chunk content consistent with the progressive enlargement of working memory capacity. Importantly, HIS segment keypress content continued to rise even after overall performance plateaued. Theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling ({theta}/{gamma} PAC) and beta ({beta})-band bursts, mechanisms implicated in maintaining and binding individual actions into sequences in working memory, were elevated during HIS segments with hippocampal {theta}/{gamma} PAC predicting HIS segment content. Our results suggest that working memory capacity expands during early learning of a naturalistic skill and continues strengthening with practice after skill plateau is reached, possibly supported by hippocampal theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling.",

      "title": "Processing of Emotional Faces Has Unique Functional and Cytoarchitectural Associations in those with an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis.",
      "content": "Those with an autism spectrum diagnosis (ASD) have been found to process emotional faces differently than other populations. Processing of emotional faces requires engagement of temporal, frontal, occipital, and limbic brain regions. Functional activity has been shown to differ in those with an ASD, particularly in the amygdala, inferior frontal cortex (IFC), and temporal brain regions. However, the consistency and direction of these associations have been inconsistent across studies. Recent findings have demonstrated that measures of neuron density differ in those with an ASD. Some of these regional differences in cytoarchitecture coincide with regions important to emotional facial processing. Therefore, the interaction between cytoarchitecture and functional activity may be important in elucidating unique neurophysiology in ASD. The present study uses diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study to investigate the relationship between cytoarchitecture and functional activity during emotional face processing in those with an ASD. 75 individuals with a reported ASD and 6,396 individuals with no reported diagnosis of an ASD (nASD) were identified. The emotional n-back (EN-Back) task was administered during fMRI acquisition, activating regions of the brain associated with processing emotional faces. Neuron cell body density was positively correlated with functional activation in the left amygdala in the ASD group but not the nASD group. These findings suggest that a unique relationship may exist between neuron cell body density in the left amygdala and functional activity while processing emotional faces in those with an ASD.",

      "title": "A Common Neural Signal of Evidence Accumulation for Perceptual and Mnemonic Decisions",
      "content": "Humans frequently make decisions based on sensory input from the external environment or information retrieved from memory. The centro-parietal positivity (CPP), an event-related EEG potential, has recently been identified as a neural correlate of sensory evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this component also reflects evidence accumulation during decisions based on long-term memory. The present study investigated whether the CPP serves as a domain-general signal of evidence accumulation across both perception and semantic memory-based decisions. We designed a visual discrimination task in which participants discriminated between the luminance of two alphanumeric strings across three levels of difficulty defined by the luminance difference. In a semantic memory task, participants discriminated between the populations of two different U.S. states, binned into three difficulty levels using US census data. After each decision, participants rated their confidence on a scale from 1 (very low) to 4 (very high). We observed a CPP component in both tasks, the slope of which scaled with the sensory or mnemonic evidence in both stimulus- and response-locked analyses. Furthermore, these CPP slopes were sensitive to reaction times (RT) and confidence in both tasks. Finally, the peak height of the CPP just prior to the response, indicative of one's decision boundary, was strongly correlated across tasks, suggesting that a common threshold was applied to the abstract evidence quantity being accumulated. Our results indicate that the CPP can be used to track the unfolding dynamics underlying decisions made both on the basis of external sensory evidence and internal mnemonic evidence.",

      "title": "Disrupted Top-Down Modulation as a Mechanism of Impaired Multisensory Processing in Children with an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis.",
      "content": "Atypical sensory processing is a core feature of autism, particularly when integration across sensory modalities is required. The neural mechanisms underlying these multisensory differences remain unclear. We recorded high-density EEG while autistic children aged 8 to 13 (AU; n=40), unaffected siblings of autistic children (SIB; n=26), and non-autistic controls (NA; n=36) performed a simple reaction-time task to auditory (A), visual (V), and audiovisual (AV) stimuli. Analyses targeted event-related potentials (ERPs; P1/N1/P2), alpha-band event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), and long-range theta-band functional connectivity (weighted phase-lag index, wPLI). Across all unisensory measures (ERPs, alpha-ERD, and connectivity), groups did not differ, indicating broadly comparable unisensory processing. By contrast, multisensory integration (MSI; operationalized for ERPs and alpha-ERD as AV - (A+V)) differed across groups: NA children showed significant ERP MSI over parieto-central sites that was absent in AU and SIB; and alpha-ERD MSI was present in all groups but significantly reduced in AU, with SIB showing an intermediate profile. Connectivity analyses revealed that AV theta-band fronto-parieto-occipital coupling was reduced in autistic relative to non-autistic children, consistent with weaker large-scale coordination during multisensory processing. Together, these results point to a multisensory-specific deficit in autism spanning early sensory encoding, posterior alpha-ERD, and fronto-posterior coupling. The convergence of results supports a mechanistic account of disrupted multisensory influences on sensory processing due to reduced multisensory attentional orientation. Intermediate SIB profiles suggest inherited liability for these neural phenotypes. These results help explain well-documented behavioral MSI differences in autism by linking impaired early enhancement with attenuated top-down control of sensory cortex.",
