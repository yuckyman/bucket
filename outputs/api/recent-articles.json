      "content": "Sleep is universal among animals with synapses, yet the synaptic functions determining the need for sleep remain elusive. By directly measuring synaptic transmission at anatomically defined synapses in Drosophila, we found that synaptic strength remained stable or declined after sleep deprivation in a circuit-specific manner. In contrast, presynaptic release probability (Pr) consistently decreased with sleep loss across circuits and species, stemming from reduced Ca2+ influx or weakened vesicle-channel coupling at presynaptic terminals, and recovered after sleep. Bidirectional manipulations of Pr altered sleep pressure, establishing a causal relationship between presynaptic function and sleep need. Non-synaptic sleep-regulatory signaling pathways consistently modulate Pr but not synaptic strength. Thus, our findings identify Pr, rather than synaptic strength, as the conserved synaptic substrate underlying sleep need.",

      "content": "Systems presenting haptic information have emerged as an important technological advance in assisting individuals with sensory impairments or amputations, where the aim is to enhance sensory perception or provide sensory substitution through tactile feedback. These systems provide information on limb positioning, environmental interactions, and gait events, significantly improving mobility in amputees and their confidence about using such devices. This review summarizes recent progress in haptic...",

      "content": "The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",

Current family planning interventions should target women with sensory disabilities by prioritising accessible communication methods (e.g., braille, sign language), disability awareness training for healthcare workers, and integration of reproductive health services into disability support programmes.",
