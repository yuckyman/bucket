      "title": "N6-methyladenosine RNA methylation is a novel epitranscriptomic regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and vulnerability to relapse",
      "content": "While internal RNA modifications have been known for decades, the contribution of epitranscriptomics to alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains unexplored. Here we investigated, for the first time, the role of the most abundant mRNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in the regulation of alcohol drinking and alcohol mediated gene expression. The fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) plays a key role in erasing m6A RNA methylation marks. We generated brain m6A hypermethylated mice with selective deletion of FTO in neurons by crossing FTO-floxed mice (FTO-fl/fl) with the synapsin-1-CRE deleter line (Syn1-CRE). Neuronal FTO-deficient mice showed enhanced initial motivation for alcohol, achieved escalated (dependent) drinking more rapidly after repeated cycles of alcohol intoxication and were more susceptible to relapse to heavy drinking following a period of abstinence. Alcohol-naive neuronal FTO-deficient mice exhibited potentiated alcohol-induced anxiolytic and sedative effects and blunted anxiogenic responses, despite unaltered alcohol metabolism. We carried out RNA-Seq of enriched methylated RNA by immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) and RNA-Seq profiling of unenriched RNA to study alcohols effect on the epitranscriptomic and transcriptional landscape. We observed that a history of alcohol intoxication induces robust RNA m6A hypermethylation in the hippocampus and that FTO-deficiency markedly alters m6A methylation and transcriptional dynamics. GSEA pathway analysis showed that neuronal FTO deficiency induces addiction-relevant pathways and alters monoaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission, providing a molecular basis for the heightened vulnerability to alcohol abuse. Our findings demonstrate that neuronal m6A RNA methylation is a novel regulator of excessive alcohol drinking and alcohol-dependent gene expression and its dysregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis AUD.",

      "title": "Rapid neocortical network modifications via dendritic plateau potential induced plasticity",
      "content": "Learning in brains is associated with changes in neuronal network activity thought to be driven by synaptic plasticity. While recent work in the hippocampus has revealed some of the mechanisms involved there, less is known about how neocortical circuits adapt, especially during behavior. Here to determine if neocortical areas possess rapid plasticity mechanisms that could support online adaptations we used optical imaging and intracellular membrane potential (Vm) recordings to examine the activity of layer V neurons in a higher visual area of mice learning a task. The introduction of a novel rewarded stimulus resulted in a rapid modification of population activity that featured abrupt alterations in single neuron selectivity. Vm recordings revealed that both naturally occurring and experimentally-induced dendritic calcium plateau potentials (plateaus) rapidly alter the action potential (APs) output and Vm dynamics of neurons over many seconds of time around the plateau, in some cases from one trial to the next. Trains of high frequency APs had no effect. Finally, experimental inhibition during learning of the distal dendritic region responsible for initiating plateaus reduced the rate of population level adaptation. Our findings suggest that the deep layers of higher order visual cortex possess a rapid learning mechanism mediated by plateau-induced synaptic plasticity.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.
