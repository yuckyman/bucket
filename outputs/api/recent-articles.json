      "title": "Soluble DLK1 secreted by telomere-shortening-induced senescent microglia impairs oligodendrocyte functions and alters neuronal activity",
      "content": "Aging is the major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease, yet the mechanisms linking physiological aging to brain dysfunction remain unclear. Because telomere erosion is a hallmark of aging, we examined its impact on glial and neuronal physiology. Telomere shortened mice showed lipofuscinosis, hypomyelination, microglial atrophy, and cognitive deficits. Single nuclei RNA-seq revealed accelerated glial aging, elevated microglial senescence pathways, and impaired oligodendrocyte functions. Inducing senescence in human iPSC derived microglia with shortened telomeres identified soluble DLK1 as a novel senescence associated ligand. sDLK1 was increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of telomere shortened and naturally aged mice, and this increase was eliminated by microglial depletion. AAV delivery of sDLK1 in vivo caused hypomyelination and blocked oligodendrocyte lineage progression, demonstrating the detrimental nature of excessive sDLK1. In human iPSC systems, sDLK1 impaired oligodendrocyte maturation and altered calcium signaling in excitatory neurons. These findings identify microglial senescence as a core consequence of telomere shortening and reveal sDLK1 as a microglia-derived senescence ligand that drives oligodendrocyte and neuronal dysfunction in aging.",

      "title": "Persistent enhancement of intrinsic neuronal excitability induced by transient divalent cation depletion",
      "content": "Fluctuations in external calcium concentration [Ca2+]e occur during the wake and sleep cycle and during intense neuronal activity. However, the incidence of these fluctuations on neuronal excitability is not precisely known. We show here that reducing divalent cation (Ca2+ and Mg2+) concentrations from 1.3/0.8 to 0.6/0.4 mM during 15-30 minutes induces long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability (LTP-IE) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. LTP-IE induced by low divalent cations is associated with a hyperpolarization of the action potential threshold and constitutes a positive feed-back of brain activity. This plasticity requires Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR), IP3 receptor (IP3R) and calcium-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII). In fact, LTP-IE was occluded in the presence of the calcilytic NPS-2143 and absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. In addition, inhibiting IP3R with 2-APB and CaMKII with kin considerably reduced LTP-IE magnitude. LTP-IE and synaptic potentiation (LTP) induced by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) protocol were also found to depend on CaSR as they were totally absent in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Spontaneous excitatory synaptic activity was found to be reduced by ~35% following LTP induced by STDP. Importantly, this drop of spontaneous activity was not observed in CRISPR CaSR neurons. Taken together, these results show that CaSR plays a critical role in LTP-IE induced by low [Ca2+]e and [Mg2+]e and as well as in LTP of synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability induced by STDP.",

      "title": "Serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus scale O2 utilization in response to traumatic stress",
      "content": "Trauma is a main cause of psychiatric disorders. Approximately 24% of trauma-exposed individuals suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder throughout their lifetime, however, the vast majority of people are resilient. Why some people are resilient while others develop mental disorders in face of trauma in a short timescale? Here, we show that O2 actively initiates a cell-signaling pathway that regulates behavioral outcomes in response to traumatic stress. We found that serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT neurons) projecting to the ventral caudate putamen and the ventral tegmental area exhibit distinct physiological patterns of O2 utilization. In response to traumatic stress, O2 utilization in these neurons changed individually, following either a susceptible or resilient pattern, thereby modulating corresponding behaviors. This O2 scaling was regulated by ferroptosis within the DRN5-HT neurons. Thus, we identify a previously unrecognized function of O2, opening an avenue for the treatment and prevention of stress-related disorders.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "Psilocybin rapidly, but not immediately, reverses reward learning deficits in a durable manner in an inflammatory rat model of depressive symptoms",
      "content": "The serotonergic psychedelic, psilocybin, shows potential for rapid and sustained antidepressant effects but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using a chronic interferon-alpha-induced rat model of depression, we show acute psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) reverses impaired reward-induced biases within 24hrs, with effects enduring for at least 7 days. This suggests psilocybin can restore blunted reward processing, an effect which could significantly contribute to its sustained antidepressant effects.",

      "title": "Astrocyte stimulation reopens the window of the critical period for the experience-dependent plasticity of retinogeniculate synapses",
      "content": "A specific time window during which neural circuits undergo dramatic changes in response to individual experiences is known as the critical period (CP). Developing methods to reopen the CP after its closure could lead to the establishment of effective treatment approaches. The retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) undergo experience-dependent remodeling only during the limited period of development. We investigated the effects of astrocyte manipulation on the restoration of RG synapse plasticity after the CP termination. Astrocytic stimulation with the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) after the CP closure caused RG synapse remodeling in the dark-reared mice but not in those reared in normal conditions. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of dLGN astrocytes implicated the underlying mechanisms of astrocyte-induced RG synaptic plasticity. Therefore, astrocytes can regulate the susceptibility of RG synapses to experience-dependent plasticity after CP termination.",
