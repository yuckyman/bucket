      "title": "Catestatin ameliorates tauopathy and amyloidogenesis via adrenergic inhibition",
      "content": "Neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimers disease, Corticobasal Degeneration, and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy are characterized by Tau aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation and progressive cognitive decline. Although metabolic dysregulation and neuropeptide imbalance have been linked to these disorders, the functional consequences of such imbalance and its potential for therapeutic reversal remain poorly understood. Our previous work identified chromogranin A, which encodes a pro-hormone for several metabolic peptides, as a key regulator of Tau pathology. Here, we investigate Catestatin, a chromogranin A derived peptide that is a potent inhibitor of catecholamine release and has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower peripheral blood pressure. We report significant reductions in CST levels in the hippocampus and cortex of AD brains, as well as in the frontal cortex of CBD and the basal ganglia of PSP. Supplementing CST in cortical neuronal cultures and organotypic slice cultures decreased Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. In vivo, CST administration in PS19 Tauopathy mice reduced pathological Tau species, attenuated gliosis, and improved cognitive function. CST treatment also lowered amyloid plaque burden and neuroinflammation in 5XFAD mice. Mechanistically, CST decreased epinephrine levels in both PS19 and 5XFAD mice and suppressed downstream protein kinase A hyperactivation in PS19 and OTSC. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized neuropeptidergic mechanism linking CST deficiency to elevated adrenergic receptor, epinephrine and PKA stress signaling and Tauopathy driven neurodegeneration, suggesting CST replacement as a promising therapeutic approach.",

      "content": "Ovarian hormone shifts enable reproduction and are associated with substantial brain plasticity and disease risks. While imaging studies provide (micro)structural insights into brain changes across the ovarian cycle and pregnancy, the high resolution, single-cell map of the brain across reproductive transitions is missing. Here, we performed multiome (gene expression and chromatin accessibility) analysis of the mouse ventral hippocampus (vHIP) across sex, estrous cycle, and peripartum period at single cell resolution. We identify dynamic changes in vHIP cellular composition across the estrous cycle and pregnancy, including in the neural stem cells of the dentate gyrus (DG), enabling hormone-driven neurogenesis. Major gene expression changes are neuronal function-relevant, cell type-specific, and found in excitatory neurons of CA1, CA3, and DG subfields, across sex and reproductive transitions. In contrast, chromatin accessibility changes are more extensive and found across cell types, likely driven by estrogen level shifts in both within-female and between-sex comparisons. We show that chromatin remodeling during the estrous cycle primes the genome for gene expression changes during pregnancy and is also enriched for brain disease-relevant genes. Finally, we reveal a thyroid hormone transporter (Transthyretin, Ttr) gene as the major candidate gene that drives structural and behavioral changes across the estrous cycle and pregnancy. Our study provides an extensive cellular and molecular view of how reproductive transitions shape the brain and opens the possibility to target downstream targets of estrogen, including thyroid hormone signaling, as a treatment option for hormone-sensitive periods in women.",

      "title": "Trait anxiety is associated with idiosyncratic neural event boundaries during naturalistic movie-watching",
      "content": "Anxiety is associated with altered patterns of attention to images and objects, but how it influences the perception of continuous experiences remains underexplored. Here, we examined how anxiety influences the segmentation of continuous experience into discrete events. Using a large-scale open-access dataset and data-driven methods to detect neural event boundaries, we compared neural event segmentation between healthy adults with high (N=60) and low trait-level anxiety (N=60) as they viewed a short suspenseful film. While the overall temporal event segmentation hierarchy was preserved across groups, higher-anxiety individuals had more idiosyncratic boundaries, exhibiting reduced alignment to both low-anxiety individuals and one another. This divergence was the most pronounced in the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks, suggesting that anxiety-related disruptions in top-down attentional control may contribute to less consistent segmentation. Furthermore, boundary variability in anxious participants was higher during moments rated as more anxiety-provoking by a large language model, controlling for arousal, valence, and low-level visual features. Together, these findings suggest that idiosyncratic event models in anxious individuals result in non-normative organization of continuous experience, leading to more individualized and inconsistent event boundaries. Such variability in segmentation may have downstream consequences for prediction, memory, and social cognition, offering a potential neural mechanism by which anxiety influences the interpretation and recall of everyday experiences. Our findings highlight trait-level variability as a lens through which the brain parses information and offers a neurocomputational framework for investigating individual differences in naturalistic event cognition.",

      "title": "Neural representations of visual memory in inferotemporal cortex reveal a generalizable framework for translating between spikes and field potentials",
      "content": "Translating neurophysiological findings requires understanding the relationship between common measures of brain activity in animals (spiking activity) and humans (local field potentials, LFP). Prior work suggests alignment between population spiking and high-gamma activity (HGA, 50-150 Hz) of the LFP; however, this is not always observed and is consequently debated. Here, we show that this alignment and prior failures depend on the underlying coding scheme. First, we examined neural representations of variables related to visual memory in macaque inferotemporal cortex. We found that spikes and HGA were strikingly aligned for variables encoded as population response magnitude (novelty, recency, and memorability). However, a variable encoded as a distributed pattern of activity (category) was misaligned. Next, we showed that these insights generalize across many published studies, accounting for prior alignment successes and failures. These results provide a framework for translating between spikes and LFPs, highlighting the scenarios likely to be fruitful for translation.",
