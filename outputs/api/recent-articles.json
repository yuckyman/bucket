      "title": "Peripheral CB1R inhibition modulates food intake and metabolic efficiency in obesity independently of the gut-brain vagal axis",
      "content": "Obesity arises from profound disruptions in neuroendocrine communication and impaired central regulation of energy homeostasis. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), through cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs), is a key modulator of feeding, metabolism, and gut-brain signaling. While global CB1R blockade improves metabolic control, its clinical translation has been limited by adverse neuropsychiatric effects, underscoring the therapeutic potential of peripherally restricted CB1R inhibition whose neural mechanisms remain insufficiently defined. Here, we show that two peripheral CB1R antagonists, the inverse agonist JD-5037 and the neutral antagonist AM6545, selectively suppress food intake and shift nutrient partitioning toward fat oxidation in obese, but not lean, mice, without altering total energy expenditure. We further demonstrate that high-fat exposure markedly upregulates CB1R expression in the nodose ganglia, suggesting an enhanced reliance on periphery-to-brain ECS signaling in obesity. Using cFos mapping, we reveal that inhibition of peripheral CB1Rs robustly recruits satiety-related brainstem and hypothalamic structures. Interestingly, disruption of the gut-brain vagal axis abolishes JD-5037-induced activation of brainstem nuclei but leaves hypothalamic activation, and the anorexigenic response, fully intact. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of key vagal endocrine mediators, cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), fails to blunt the feeding-suppressive effects of peripheral CB1R blockade. These findings uncover an unprecedent dual mechanism whereby vagal pathways mediate brainstem engagement, whereas hypothalamic recruitment and metabolic benefits arise through vagal-independent signaling. Our results position peripheral CB1R inhibition as a mechanistically distinct approach capable of engaging central homeostatic circuits without direct brain penetration, supporting peripherally acting CB1R antagonists as promising therapeutics for obesity and metabolic disorders.",

      "title": "Boosting the signal: Expectation-driven gain modulation of preparatory spatial attention",
      "content": "The visual system can flexibly adjust attentional deployment to match task demands, but whether observers can proactively modulate the spatial scope of attention based on expectations about upcoming search difficulty remains unclear. According to the zoom lens model, attention can narrow or broaden its spatial extent, with narrower focus enhancing processing efficiency, a mechanism that would benefit target discrimination in crowded displays. We tested whether observers adjust attentional scope when expecting sparse versus dense search arrays by combining spatial cueing with block-wise manipulations of display density expectations. Participants performed a visual search task in which endogenous cues predicted target location, while blocks predominantly contained either sparse (1 target, 3 distractors) or dense (1 target, 7 distractors) displays. We applied inverted encoding models to EEG data to reconstruct spatial channel tuning functions, enabling precise characterization of both the locus and breadth of attentional deployment. Behaviorally, expecting difficult searches selectively improved accuracy at cued locations without costs elsewhere. Consistent with this selective benefit, neural measurements revealed that expectancy enhanced the amplitude of spatially selective responses at the attended location but did not alter tuning width. These findings demonstrate that expectations about search difficulty modulate attention through gain-based signal enhancement rather than adjustments to spatial scope, revealing that preparatory attentional control operates via amplitude modulation within a stable spatial focus. This mechanism complements reactive attentional adjustments and provides an efficient means for the visual system to optimize processing under predictable task demands.",

      "content": "Noxious mechanical stimuli give rise to distinct percepts, from sharp cutaneous pain to diffuse visceral discomfort, yet the nociceptor ensembles that underlie these differences remain poorly defined. We mapped the peripheral architecture of nociceptive signaling by combining in vivo activity labeling of pelvic nerve afferents with single-cell RNA sequencing. Noxious stimuli recruited diverse classes of mechano-nociceptors, but stimulus type exerted modest influence on the composition of activated ensembles. Instead, tissue identity imposed the dominant organizational structure: stimulation of cutaneous and deep pelvic tissues engaged distinct subsets of both myelinated and unmyelinated neurons, revealing a clear domain-level division. Within this architecture, we identified a bladder-innervating myelinated nociceptor subtype with distinctive molecular features, illustrating an additional layer of refinement. Functional imaging and anatomical tracing corroborated this multilevel organization. These findings reveal a hierarchical organization of peripheral mechanical pain encoding, in which mechano-nociceptor populations are differentially engaged according to tissue domain and organ context.",

      "content": "Food addiction is a multifactorial disorder characterized by a loss of control over food intake, contributing to the development of obesity. To investigate the involvement of the prelimbic (PL) medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the transition to food addiction, we examined PL calcium dynamics in mice exhibiting addicted versus non-addicted behavioral phenotypes. Our behavioral results allowed the identification of two distinct subpopulations of addicted and non-addicted mice, enabling direct comparison of their neural activity profiles. Addicted and non-addicted mice showed significant differences across several PL calcium activity parameters. These findings demonstrate a strong association between PL mPFC calcium activity dynamics and key addiction criteria, highlighting a critical role of this brain region in the development of food addiction. Understanding these neurobiological differences enhances our insight into brain mechanisms underlying loss of eating control and may inform more targeted approaches for studying and ultimately treating food addiction.",

      "title": "Deficient processing of regularity violations during visuospatial neglect: a visual mismatch negativity study",
      "content": "Visuospatial neglect (VSN) after right-hemisphere stroke causes reduced engagement with left-sided stimuli, but how VSN affects automatic processes, i.e. the registration of regularities and regularity violations is still equivocal. This study investigated these processes using event-related potential components C1, C2/N1, and the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), and how they differ in VSN compared to stroke and healthy controls, and their changes with time and rehabilitation. We applied a passive oddball paradigm, where diamond patterns periodically disappeared (OFF events) and reappeared (ON events) on the lower left and right sides, creating two simultaneous but independent sequences with standard and deviant events. The study included a VSN group (N=17, M=53.88{+/-}0.28 yrs); stroke patients (N=16, M = 56.81{+/-}13.26 yrs); and healthy participants (N=17, M=53.89{+/-}10.79 yrs). The VSN group underwent measurements three times: pre- and post-rehabilitation, and at a 4-month follow-up. Our results show that the C1 component emerged reliably in healthy participants and as a tendency in stroke controls, but not in VSN at any measurement point. The C2/N1 component emerged for all events without group differences. VSN patients showed no reliable vMMN, while it emerged in stroke patients for left-sided OFF events. Healthy controls showed vMMN in every condition. Our results suggest that both stroke and VSN impair the automatic detection of regularity violations, but VSN does so in a more substantial way, and this deficit does not improve with time or rehabilitation. Furthermore, the missing C1 component in VSN may indicate an early-stage deficiency even in visual processing.",

      "title": "Spatial auditory change detection in listeners with hearing loss",
      "content": "Everyday listening relies on the auditory system's ability to automatically monitor the background soundscape and detect new or changing sources. Although change detection is a fundamental aspect of situational awareness, little is known about how hearing impairment affects this ability. This study examined how sensorineural hearing loss influences spatial auditory change detection. Older hearing-impaired listeners (N = 30) completed a spatial change detection task requiring them to identify the appearance of a new sound source within a complex spatialised acoustic scene. Hearing loss was characterised by three factors that were measured with standard clinical tests: audiometric hearing thresholds, sensitivity to small level changes, and sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation. Simple and mixed-effects linear models were used to test how these factors predicted reaction time, hit rate, and false alarm rate. Listeners with poorer spectrotemporal sensitivity, higher audiometric hearing thresholds, and older age showed slower and less accurate detection, whereas sensitivity to small changes in level did not predict outcomes. Detection also varied with spatial location, where appearing sources from behind were detected more slowly and less accurately than those from the front or sides. Numerical analysis using head-related transfer functions confirmed that these rear-field effects were unlikely to be explained by overall or frequency-specific acoustic level differences. These findings reveal that hearing loss, age, and spatial factors jointly shape listeners' ability to monitor dynamic auditory scenes. Additionally, testing spectrotemporal sensitivity offers a promising clinical measure of non-speech auditory processing with relevance for hearing-aid fitting and situational awareness.",
