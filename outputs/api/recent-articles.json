      "title": "Associations Between Age, Heart Rate Variability, and BOLD fMRI Signal Variability",
      "content": "Numerous studies report that BOLD fMRI signal variance (SDBOLD) decreases with age. However, these associations may partly reflect cardiovascular contributions to the BOLD signal. For example, heart rate variability (HRV) has been positively associated with Resting State Fluctuation Amplitude (RSFA), which captures low frequency components of BOLD fMRI variability. HRV is also negatively associated with age, which could potentially confound age-SDBOLD associations. Yet, limited research has examined HRV-SDBOLD associations or tested within-person HRV-SDBOLD coupling using sliding window analyses of simultaneous HRV and SDBOLD. We analyzed resting-state fMRI data from two independent Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) samples: Core at M3 (n=115) and Refresher at MR1 (n=101). Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses revealed significant positive HRV-SDBOLD associations (Core: permutation p=0.018; Refresher: permutation p<0.001). Whole brain age-SDBOLD PLS associations were non-significant via permutation tests across several models (Core: permutation p=0.201; Refresher: permutation p=0.121). We found age-related decreases in SDBOLD across ~70% of voxels in both samples. Concordance analyses showed 67-69% of brain voxels exhibited negative age-SDBOLD but positive HRV-SDBOLD relationships, suggesting that regions showing age-related decreases in SDBOLD also showed HRV-related increases in SDBOLD. Sliding-window analyses demonstrated robust positive within-person associations between person-centered HRV and SDBOLD via different HRV metrics: SDNN (Core: p < 0.001; Refresher: p < 0.001), RMSSD (Core: p = 0.072; Refresher: p = 0.009), and low frequency (Core: p < 0.001; Refresher: p < 0.001), with non-significant effects of high frequency (Core: p = 0.516; Refresher: p = 0.12) HRV. Thus, regardless of baseline levels, windows with higher HRV corresponded to higher SDBOLD, suggesting that cardiovascular factors partially explain age-SDBOLD associations and HRV may mechanistically influence SDBOLD. These results suggest that controlling for HRV, especially low-frequency HRV or SDNN, may be necessary when analyzing SDBOLD to isolate neural effects.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

      "title": "P2CSL: cross-subject EEG classification by subspace class prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling",
      "content": "Objective. Domain adaptation (DA) has achieved remarkable performance in cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding by mitigating the inter-subject data distribution discrepancies. However, when exploring the feature alignment subspace and performing self-supervised pseudo-labeling in an iterative way, two difficulties are often encountered: one is that unreliable target labeling results inevitably mislead the domain-free feature learning process in the early stage and the other is that the contribution of source and target samples should be balanced in the later stage. Approach. To address both issues, this paper proposes prototype-based progressive confident target sample labeling (P2CSL) method to use subspace class prototypes to assist in labeling target samples under the unified framework of domain-invariant EEG feature learning and the self-supervised target sample labeling, and progressively incorporate confident target samples into DA model fitting. The underlying rationality is that early-stage pseudo-labels from unconverged models are prone to error propagation, requiring auxiliary mechanisms to ensure their reliability and stabilize training. With the gradual alignment of cross-subject features, the estimated pseudo-label information of target domain will be more reliable, meaning that more target samples should be involved in model training. Main results. Experiments on emotion recognition and inner speech decoding demonstrate the competitive performance of P2CSL in cross-subject EEG classification in comparison with SOTA methods. Significance. Our study indicates the effectiveness of jointly considering the reliability of target samples and their contribution to model training in the context of DA. In addition, some fine-grained results including the sample confidence allocation strategy, the DA effects, and the dynamic model optimization process are provided to further illustrate the model execution details.",

      "title": "Towards optimizing target engagement in non-invasive trigeminal nerve stimulation: anatomical characterization of the human trigeminal nerve",
      "content": "Objective. Cranial nerve stimulation uses electric current to modulate higher-order brain activity and organ function via nerves, including the vagus and trigeminal, with applications in migraine, epilepsy, and pediatric attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The trigeminal nerve is an emerging target for non-invasive neuromodulation due to the superficial trajectory of its branches, the supraorbital (SON), infraorbital (ION), and mental nerves (MN), and the predominantly sensory composition of the SON and ION. However, the parameters and outcomes of trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) remain varied. Approach. This study characterizes the anatomical course and tissue composition of the SON, ION, and MN using five human donors. Computed tomography imaging was used to localize each nerve\u2019s exit foramen and distance to midline. Microdissections quantified nerve circumference and depth relative to the skin surface. Histological analysis described the number of fascicles and fascicular tissue area. Nerve depths were incorporated into an illustrative finite element model to assess the effect of interface properties on activation of on- and off-target neural pathways. Main results. Cadaveric measurements, histological analyses, and imaging outline the depths, branching patterns, and fascicular organization within the trigeminal nerve branches. The SON was found to be significantly more superficial than the ION and MN with a higher nerve-to-connective tissue ratio compared to the MN. Our illustrative modeling demonstrated that depth was a driving factor for neural activation and sensitivity to skin impedance properties. Significance. The SON presents the most accessible and anatomically favorable target for transcutaneous TNS among the branches examined due to its superficial location. Consistent with our previous work, however, preferential activation of low-threshold nociceptors compared to nerve trunks may lead to treatment-limiting off-target side effects. These findings offer an anatomically informed framework to guide further modeling, electrode design, and in situ imaging of nerve branching patterns to better estimate activation of on- and off- target pathways.",

      "title": "Focal thalamic infrared neural stimulation propagates dynamical transformations in auditory cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Infrared neural stimulation (INS) has emerged as a potent neuromodulation technology, offering safe and focal stimulation with superior spatial recruitment profiles compared to conventional electrical methods. However, the neural dynamics induced by INS stimulation remain poorly understood. Elucidating these dynamics will help develop new INS stimulation paradigms and advance its clinical application. Approach. In this study, we assessed the local network dynamics of INS entrainment in the auditory thalamocortical circuit using the chronically implanted rat model. Our approach focused on measuring INS energy-based local field potential (LFP) recruitment induced by focal thalamocortical stimulation. We further characterized linear and nonlinear oscillatory LFP activity in response to single-pulse and periodic INS and performed spectral decomposition to uncover specific LFP band entrainment to INS. Finally, we examined spike-field transformations across the thalamocortical synapse using spike-LFP coherence coupling measures. Main results. We found that INS significantly increases LFP amplitude as a log-linear function of INS energy per pulse, primarily entraining to LFP \u03b2 and \u03b3 bands with synchrony extending to 200 Hz in some cases. A subset of neurons demonstrated nonlinear, chaotic oscillations linked to information transfer across cortical circuits. Finally, we utilized spike-field coherences to correlate spike coupling to LFP frequency band activity and suggest an energy-dependent model of network activation resulting from INS stimulation. Significance. We show that INS reliably drives robust network activity and can potently modulate cortical field potentials across a wide range of frequencies in a stimulus parameter-dependent manner. Based on these results, we propose design principles for developing full coverage, all-optical thalamocortical auditory neuroprostheses.",
