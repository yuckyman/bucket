      "title": "Gonadal and sex chromosomal contributions to sex differences in mammalian brain organization",
      "content": "Sex differences in brain development may contribute to well-known sex differences in behavior and neuropsychiatric risk - making it important to comprehensively map and mechanistically annotate normative sex differences in brain organization. Most sex differences in mammalian brain organization have previously been attributed to differential effects of gonadal hormones based on outcomes from rodent endocrine manipulations at canonical subcortical foci of male-biased brain volume. However, a systematic quantification of both gonadal and sex chromosome dosage (SCD) contributions across all regions of sex-biased brain volume has been lacking. Here, using structural neuroimaging scans from wild-type (n=670) and transgenic mice that dissociate gonadal, X-, and Y-chromosome effects (n=181), we show that: many more brain regions are volumetrically sex-biased than previously recognized; gonadal effects dominate throughout this expanded map of sex differences; several regions also show prominent SCD contributions to anatomical sex differences, which can both reinforce or counteract gonadal effects in a regionally specific manner. Targeted single nucleus RNA sequencing at a region of female-biased cerebellar volume reveals that combined gonadal and SCD effects also drive sex-biased cellular gene expression. These findings revise our understanding of the spatial distribution and causal basis of sex-differences in the mammalian brain, illuminating a key axis of biological variation in health and disease.",

      "title": "Abnormal neuronal and synaptic morphology in Down syndrome brains reproduces in 2D and 3D human cellular models",
      "content": "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common autosomal aneuploidy compatible with postnatal survival and is caused by full or partial trisomy of chromosome 21. In this study, human isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were differentiated into 2D neurons and cortico-striatal assembloids (hCSAs). Aberrant neuronal morphology was observed: trisomic (T21) neurons formed aggregates of cell bodies interconnected with thick neurite bundles radiating outwards, connected and overlapped with other neurons in between the bundles while disomic (D21) neurons were evenly distributed across the surface and formed strong neuronal networks. Detailed analysis revealed significantly shorter neurites with larger diameter, fewer branches, and fewer terminal points in T21 neurons compared to D21 neurons in both 2D cultures and hCSAs. We observed similar phenotypes in foetal and postnatal human brain tissue. Furthermore, we observed aberrant mitochondrial morphology with an excess of some mitochondrial proteins (AIF, TOMM20) and significantly lower expression of synaptic markers (SYN-1, PSD95 and GEPH) throughout in vitro differentiation of T21 neurons. Finally, our data showed that T21 spheroids were significantly smaller throughout differentiation compared to D21 spheroids. T21 spheroids also exhibited significantly higher expression of neural stem cells (SOX2), significantly lower expression of proliferating cells (Ki67) and significantly higher expression of apoptotic cells (CCaspase-3). Overall, our study demonstrates that trisomy 21 leads to aberrant neuronal morphology in both 2D neurons and hCSAs, consistent with observations in the human brain.",

      "title": "The Caudate Nucleus Exhibits Distinct Pathology and Cell Type-Specific Responses Across Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Amyloid-beta presence in the caudate nucleus (Ca) partially defines Thal stage III in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known about AD's cellular impact on the region. Leveraging a public basal ganglia taxonomy of cellular populations, we generated a cellular-resolution atlas of AD-associated pathological changes in Ca. Unlike cortex, we found that Ca AD pathology is dominated by two key features: phosphorylated tau (pTau)-containing neuropil threads enriched near oligodendrocytes in white matter tracts and amyloid-beta diffuse plaques enriched in gray matter. Although AD pathology in affected cortical regions results in neuronal loss, we find no AD-driven reductions in neuron proportions in Ca. However, there were observable changes in multiple cellular populations. Protoplasmic astrocytes and FLT1+/IL1B+ microglia increased in abundance with global pTau levels. We also observe gene expression changes in fast-spiking PTHLH-PVALB interneurons indicative of disrupted signaling pathways and altered intrinsic physiological properties. This work provides a cellular-resolution framework for understanding AD pathology in Ca.",

      "title": "A normative account of human temporal structure learning",
      "content": "People rapidly recalibrate their expectations about the world in the face of surprising observations. This recalibration should depend on the temporal structure of the environment, however how people should and do learn temporal structures remains unknown. To examine this gap, we developed a Bayesian model that infers temporal structure of the environment directly from observations and makes accurate predictions across qualitatively different environments. We tested predictions of our model in an online behavioral study in which participants predicted outcomes generated according to various temporal structures, and demonstrated that people learned to exploit these structures in a qualitatively similar manner to that of our structure learning model. Furthermore, we show that normative structure learning accounts for puzzling asymmetries previously observed in sequential effects of temporal structures on human learning. Taken together our model and empirical data provide the first general account of how people use temporal structures to interpret unexpected observations in the service of learning.",

      "title": "Simultaneous EEG-fMRI investigation of sound sequence processing in human neonates",
      "content": "The ability to detect sensory regularities and their violations (i.e. deviance) is fundamental for learning and the orientation of attention across the lifespan. This starts from the prenatal period, where the environment is rich in regular patterns and deviations of auditory stimulation which likely provides the basis for the emergence of early learning capacities. Following birth, EEG recordings of brain activity have demonstrated that neonates detect violations of regularity and show a robust mismatch response to deviant auditory stimuli. However, it is unknown how this processing is integrated across wider regions within emergent brain networks. To gain comprehensive insight into both the temporal and spatial properties of the processing underlying sensory deviance detection in the neonatal brain, we acquired simultaneous EEG and fMRI data in sleeping neonates during an auditory oddball paradigm. A mismatch response was identified with EEG when a deviant sound appeared after a sequence of identical sounds but not when a sound was omitted, suggesting encoding of deviances that violated local sequence regularity, but not global sequence structure. Simultaneous fMRI demonstrated engagement of distributed cortical networks during sound sequence processing, encompassing temporal, sensori-motor, and inferior frontal cortices, as well as subcortical regions including the thalamus and hippocampus. Deviance detection was associated with activity in the superior and ventromedial (hippocampus and parahippocampus) parts of the temporal lobe, and the precentral gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that neonatal brain detects deviance in sound sequences through the encoding of local regularities, supported by distinct processing pathways within sensory and limbic systems. These insights help advance our understanding of early auditory learning mechanisms, with implications for understanding how atypical developmental trajectories may emerge in these substrates.",

      "title": "Episodic memory consolidation by reactivation of human concept neurons during sleep reflects contents, not sequence of events",
      "content": "How do our brains manage to store our everyday experiences into memory? Neurons in the human temporal lobe that respond to the concept of an individual person or object have been shown to provide the semantic building blocks for episodic memory. Recording from 1433 neurons in neurosurgical patients who learned a story involving specific concepts, we found reactivation of neurons representing these concepts during slow-wave sleep after learning. Concept neurons were conjointly reactivated, particularly during sharp-wave ripples, with time lags suitable for synaptic modification. However, the temporal sequence of reactivation did not reflect the sequence of concepts in the learned story. Unlike rodent place cells, which can acquire preferred firing locations during exploration of new environments according to their pre-existing preferred sequence of activation, human concept neurons are tuned to specific semantic contents before learning starts. Consequently, pre-existing firing sequences correlate with consecutive place fields in rodents, but not with sequences of events in human experience. Thus, in contrast to reactivation of rodent place cells, reactivation of human concept cells does not reflect sequences of events in human experience.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial hitch-hiking of Mapt mRNA maintains Tau levels in axons",
      "content": "Hitch-hiking of transcripts on organelles, including mitochondria, has emerged as a common pathway to transport mRNAs into the axon to enable their local translation. However, the extent of mitochondrial mRNA association in vivo has not been established. Here we report the landscape of mitochondrial mRNA association in two nerve tissues, the retinal ganglion cell derived optic nerve and the motor neuron derived part of the sciatic nerve. This revealed astonishing tissue diversity between mitochondria associated mRNAs that can partly be explained by the lack of expression of the mitochondrially anchored RNA-binding protein SYNJ2a in motor neurons. This diversity led us to discover that also MAPT mRNA, encoding the axon-enriched microtubule associated protein Tau, is transported via the mitochondrial RNA anchoring complex SYNJ2a/SYNJ2BP into axons of glutamatergic neurons. Loss of SYNJ2BP prevents axonal localization of MAPT and miss-sorting of Tau, consequently stunting axonal growth in cultured hippocampal neurons. This connects mitochondrial transport to the maintenance of the local cytoskeleton and axonal growth in glutamatergic neurons.",

      "title": "Implicit learning of melodic structure: A role for pitch?",
      "content": "Growing evidence suggests that pitch influences musical processing, with melodic processing being enhanced in higher pitch ranges (e.g., Fujioka et al., 2005) and rhythmic processing being enhanced in lower pitches, and these effects may have a basis in elementary properties of the auditory system (e.g., Hove et al., 2014). As such, pitch may constitute a fundamental constraint on the mechanisms that underpin musical learning. One such mechanism is implicit learning: the ability to learn from mere exposure without intention and without a clear awareness of what has been learned. The present study examined whether the high pitch effects that enhance melodic processing extend to implicit learning of melodic structure as well. In an artificial melodic grammar experiment, it was found that participants learned melodic structure better when instantiated in a lower rather than a higher pitch range. We propose that hearing melodies in lower pitch ranges attracts more attention, because melodic information is usually instantiated in higher pitches, and lower pitch melodies may cause attention to shift leading to more learning.

Fifty-four studies focusing on ASMR were retrieved (total participant number: <em>n</em> = 11,140). ASMR can be linked to several mental health-related variables (e.g., improved mood) and personality traits (e.g., neuroticism). On the neurobiological level, ASMR has been associated with altered electrophysiological response patterns (tentatively suggesting \u03b4 wave decreases), activation of specific brain areas (particularly the anterior cingulate gyrus and movement-related regions), and atypical functional connectivity patterns as well as physiological changes such as heart rate reduction. Future studies should evaluate the link between ASMR and additional psychological constructs, reveal more specific neurobiological outcome patterns and conduct long-term ASMR intervention studies.

      "content": "We experience and express emotions via our bodies, and we are also able to infer the emotional states of others by observing their movements and postures. The ability to extract affective bodily cues in social contexts may be achieved via internal simulation, which is closely associated with experience and awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body. Here, we hypothesized that reports of one\u2019s own bodily experiences of emotions would be associated with the ability to infer other people\u2019s emotions from their bodily signals. Healthy individuals (<em>n</em> = 106) participated in two tasks. An emotional gait perception task was used to test the ability to extract emotional cues from other people\u2019s body movements. Subjective bodily experience of emotions was visualized with a computerized mapping tool, which required participants to localize sensations on the body corresponding to specific emotions. Participants reported specific locations of body sensations for different emotions. Emotional gait perception accuracy was positively associated with participants\u2019 reported intensity for bodily experiences of happiness and anger and with their tendency to report body mapping patterns similar to prototypes established in a much larger sample. Results suggest that awareness of emotions in one\u2019s own body is related to our ability to perceive emotions in others. Implications for future work on the role of embodiment in social cognition and psychiatric disorders are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Body and brain signalling during naturalistic learning situations",
      "content": "A central challenge in supporting learning and designing learning environments is to understand individual differences in learning experiences. However, despite growing interest in examining learning experiences in naturalistic contexts, studies employing multimethod and hyperscanning approaches remain scarce. In this study, electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) were combined to measure brain activity, heart rate, and heart rate variability simultaneously during authentic learning situations in aviation and forestry. We investigated how students and instructors cardiac and brain activity varied across different phases of a naturalistic learning situation and tasks with varying levels of difficulty. Results indicate that both students and instructors heart rate, heart rate variability, and brain activity vary systematically across behaviourally and pedagogically meaningful phases of the learning situation. These findings enhance our understanding of how physiological and neural activity vary within and across individuals during learning, providing insight into the nervous system determinants underlying individual differences in learning experiences.",
