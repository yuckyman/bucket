      "title": "Pragmatic representations of self- and others action in the monkey putamen",
      "content": "Social coordination in primates relies on parieto-frontal networks encoding self- and others actions. These areas send convergent projections to the putamen, but its role in representing self- and others actions remains unknown. We recorded neuronal activity from anatomically characterized putamen regions during a Mutual Action Task (MAT), where a monkey and a human took turns grasping a multi-affordance object based on sensory cues. Cortico-striatal synaptic input, indexed by local field potentials, mirrored known cortical dynamics during sensory instructions and movement, while single neurons selectively encoded the monkey s action, the human s action, or both. Grip type was encoded only during the monkey s trials. Viewing the partner s action was neither necessary nor sufficient: neurons fired even when the partner s action occurred in darkness, but not when viewed through a transparent barrier. These findings support a pragmatic role for the putamen in gating cortical representations of self- and other s actions in social contexts",

      "title": "Comparison of T1- and T2-weighted MRI contrasts of ex vivo ex situ brains fixed with solutions used in gross anatomy laboratories",
      "content": "Post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high resolution and histological correlation, so protocols have been developed by brain banks using hemispheres fixed by immersion in Neutral-buffered formalin (NBF), but they provide limited tissue samples. Conversely, anatomy laboratories could supply complete brains perfused either with a salt-saturated (SSS) or an alcohol-formaldehyde (AFS) solution. These fixation methods alter the brain's molecular properties, potentially affecting MRI quality and structural characteristics. T1- and T2-weighted (T1w, T2w) contrasts change with NBF fixation, but the effects of SSS or AFS remain unknown. We compared T1w and T2w intensities of different regions of interest (ROIs), including subcortical white matter (WM), cortical and deep gray matter (GM), in brains fixed with NBF, SSS and AFS. We scanned 20 ex situ hemispheres (NBF-immersed=7; SSS-perfused=7; AFS-perfused=6) in a 3T MRI scanner using T1w (0.7mm3) and T2w (0.64mm3) sequences overnight. Mean intensities of 29 ROIs in T1w and T2w MRIs and GM-WM ratios were calculated and compared in brains fixed with the three solutions. We found that T1w images were more affected by the fixation process, inverting the contrast of in vivo T1w and reducing the GM-WM contrast in AFS-fixed brains. T2w images resembled in vivo scans and maintained a sharp contrast in brains fixed with the three solutions, although the GM-WM intensity ratios were lowered in SSS-fixed brains. In conclusion, brains fixed with SSS and AFS from anatomy laboratories could be used for MRI studies, especially with the T2w sequence that seems more appropriate for structural analyses in different ROIs.",

      "title": "Functional MRI signals as fast as 1Hz are coupled to brain states and predict spontaneous neural activity",
      "content": "fMRI signals were traditionally seen as slow and sampled in the order of seconds, but recent technological advances have enabled much faster sampling rates. We hypothesized that high-frequency fMRI signals can capture spontaneous neural activity that index brain states. Using fast fMRI (TR=378ms) and simultaneous EEG in 27 humans drifting between sleep and wakefulness, we found that fMRI spectral power increased during NREM sleep (compared to wakefulness) across several frequency ranges as fast as 1Hz. This fast fMRI power was correlated with canonical arousal-linked EEG rhythms (alpha and delta), with spatiotemporal correlation patterns for each rhythm reflecting a combination of shared arousal dynamics and rhythm-specific neural signatures. Using machine learning, we found that alpha and delta EEG rhythms can be decoded from fast fMRI signals, in subjects held-out from the training set, showing that fMRI as fast as 0.9Hz (alpha) and 0.7Hz (delta) contains reliable neurally-coupled information that generalizes across individuals. Finally, we demonstrate that this fast fMRI acquisition allows for EEG rhythms to be decoded from 3.8s windows of fMRI data. These results reveal that high-frequency fMRI signals are coupled to dynamically varying brain states, and that fast fMRI sampling allows for more temporally precise quantification of spontaneous neural activity than previously thought possible.",

      "title": "HIF1\u03b1-dependent induction of the T-Type calcium channel CaV3.2 mediates hypoxia-induced neuronal hyperexcitability",
      "content": "Post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a major cause of acquired epilepsy in adults, yet the molecular mechanisms linking post-ischemic hypoxia to neuronal hyperexcitability remain poorly understood. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a central mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia and may contribute to epileptogenesis by regulating ion channel expression. Here, we identify the T-type calcium channel CaV3.2 (encoded by Cacna1h) as a direct transcriptional target of HIF1 and demonstrate its role in hypoxia-induced network hyperexcitability. Using neuronal cell lines, primary cortical neurons, and organotypic brain slice cultures (OTCs) from mouse and human tissue, we show that HIF1 activation, either through hypoxia or HIF1 overexpression, consistently increases Cacna1h expression. In NS20Y cells, overexpression of a normoxia-stable HIF1 variant increased Cacna1h promoter activity in both fluorescent and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The same effect was observed in primary cortical neurons, where HIF1 overexpression also elevated network activity measured by multielectrode array recordings. In murine and human OTCs, hypoxia led to marked increase of HIF1 and Cacna1h expression at both transcript and protein levels. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced a persistent increase in neuronal firing rate, which was recapitulated by HIF1 overexpression alone. Together, these results establish HIF1 as a key transcriptional regulator of CaV3.2 in neurons and reveal a conserved hypoxia-HIF1-CaV3.2 pathway that enhances neuronal excitability. This mechanism may underlie hypoxia-induced network hyperactivity and contribute to the pathogenesis of post-ischemic epileptogenesis.",

      "title": "Dynamic electrocortical states and paradoxical complexity during desflurane anesthesia",
      "content": "Background: How general anesthesia alters the dynamics of electrocortical activity is crucial to understand the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness. Local cortical activity undergoes spontaneous transitions at constant anesthetic concentration. The spatial organization and temporal dynamics of state transitions in large-scale electrocortical activity is incompletely understood. Methods: Epidural electrocorticogram was recorded from the right hemisphere in 8 rats (14 experiments) using chronically implanted 32-channel flexible electrode arrays during desflurane anesthesia at 6%, 4%, 2%, 0% inhaled concentrations, each maintained for 1 hour. Cortical states were identified by principal component analysis of power spectrograms followed by density-based clustering simultaneously across all anesthetic conditions. State-specific spatiotemporal complexity was quantified by the normalized Lempel-Ziv algorithm to capture signal variability beyond spectral effects. Temporal dynamics were assessed by state occurrence, dwell times, and transition probabilities. Results: Seven cortical states were identified. Six states generally tracked anesthetic depth with an increase in delta power and decrease in complexity, but their occurrence was not tied to any anesthetic level (p<0.001). The 7th state was a paradoxical, activated state that mostly occurred during deep anesthesia and was marked by reduced delta (p<0.001) and elevated complexity (p<0.001). Cortical activity was more likely to remain in a given state than to switch (mean dwell time of 136.55 s, persistence likelihood of 99.36%). When transitions occurred, they followed structured, non-random dynamics, primarily within light- or deep-anesthesia states (FDR-corrected p<0.05), with a mild tendency to exit deep states and enter light states (p=0.0039), consistent with anesthetic emergence. Conclusions: Electrocortical activity is not a unitary function of anesthetic concentration but involves spontaneous dynamics and paradoxically activated states with increased global complexity during deep anesthesia. The results suggest ongoing spontaneous reorganization of cortical activity during prolonged anesthetic challenge and provide new insight into anesthesia-induced brain dynamics that may inform future strategies for monitoring and manipulating the state of consciousness and facilitating recovery from general anesthesia.",

We're building wispbit (<a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>) - a tool that helps keep codebase standards alive.<p>With the help of AI coding tools, engineers are writing more code than ever. Code output has increased, but the tooling to manage this hasn't improved. Background agents still write bad code, and your IDE still writes slop without the right context.<p>So we built wispbit. It works by scanning your codebase for patterns you already use, and coming up with rules. Rules are kept up to date as standards change, and you can edit rules any time.<p>You can enforce these rules during code review, and because we have this rules system, you can run a CLI locally to review using these rules. You can think of it as a portable rules file that you can bring anywhere.<p>We put a lot of work into making a system that produces good rules and avoids slop. For repository crawling, we have an agent that dispatches subagents, similar to Anthropic's research agent. These subagents will go through and look for common patterns within modules and directories, and report back to the main agent, which synthesizes the results. We also do a historical scan on your pull request comments, determine which ones were addressed, filter out comments that wouldn't make a good rule, and use that to create or update rules.<p>Our early users are seeing 80%+ resolution rates, meaning that 80% of comments that wispbit makes are resolved.<p>Long-term, we see ourselves being a validation layer for AI-written code. With tools like Devin and Cursor, we find ourselves having to re-prompt the same solution many times. We still don't know the long-term implications on AI-assisted codebases, so we want to get in front of that as soon as possible.<p>We've opened up signups for free to HN folks at <a href=\"https://wispbit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://wispbit.com</a>.

Importantly, the developmental trajectory of these changes differs across languages. The development of phonological literacy skills comes first for learners of alphabetic languages such as English. In Chinese, however, phonological literacy skills take longer to finetune due to the character's phonological opacity. Bilingualism theories, however, suggest that...",
