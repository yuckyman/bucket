      "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "title": "NEuRT: A Transformer-Based Model for Explainable Neuronal Activity Analysis",
      "content": "The study of neuronal activity is essential for understanding brain function and its alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. Advances in in vivo imaging have enabled real-time observation of neuronal dynamics, but classical statistical methods struggle to capture the complex, time-dependent interactions within neuronal networks. Machine learning offers promising solutions for analyzing high-dimensional neuronal data, yet their application in neuroscience remains limited. Here, we introduce NEuRT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model adapted for neuronal activity analysis. NEuRT leverages self-attention mechanisms to interpret complex neuronal interactions, providing insights into patterns that traditional methods may overlook. Pre-trained on the recently introduced large annotated dataset MICrONS for signal reconstruction, NeuRT demonstrates strong generalization, effectively reconstructing activity from both visual cortex two-photon and hippocampal miniature fluorescence microscopy. Built on the BERT architecture, the NEuRT model can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. We showcase its application in classifying wild-type and transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice, based on hippocampal activity, revealing group-specific features through attention map analysis. By reducing reliance on extensive labeled data, addressing a critical challenge in neuroscience, NEuRT bridges fundamental neuroscience and disease research, offering a robust framework for AI-driven and explainable neuronal activity analysis.",

      "title": "Alteration of empathy-related behaviors in two strains of mice expressing mutations of the \u03b15 cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit",
      "content": "Human genetic association studies have linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the alpha5 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to an increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and schizophrenia. We used transgenic mice expressing either the SNP rs16969968 (termed 5SNP or 5KI) or a knockout of the Chrna5 gene (5KO) to investigate the role of 5-containing nAChRs (5*nAChRs) in emotion recognition and prosocial, rescuing-like behavioral tasks. We found that 5KO mice are impaired in the recognition of a negative affective state in a familiar peer, and displayed severely altered pro-social, altruistic behaviors, eventually assaulting peers in distress. In contrast, 5KI mice exhibited normal or improved emotion recognition and increased rescuing-like behavior. Importantly, effects of 5 mutations on emotion recognition were modulated by sex. These results demonstrate the critical implication of 5*nAChRs in emotion recognition and prosocial behaviors, revealing, sex-dependent patterns of these social emotional deficits in 5KI and 5KO mice. The current study also supports the view that 5KI and 5KO may provide a valuable preclinical model of Type I (female 5KI mice), and Type II (male 5KO mice) behavioral profiles of AUD.",

      "title": "The fos homolog kayak is required for adult eye formation and function in Drosophila",
      "content": "This study characterizes the requirements of the kayak (kay) gene in Drosophila melanogaster adult eye biology by examining mutant phenotypes in photoreceptor development, external eye morphology, corneal and bristle ultrastructure, and visually guided behaviors, such as phototaxis, in kay strong loss-of-function homozygous mutant clones. Despite previous studies on kay, there is a dearth of phenotypic characterization of the morphological and behavioral consequences of kay loss-of-function alleles in the adult eye. We find that kay is expressed in developing ommatidia in eye discs. The kay mutant ommatidia are misaligned, lack photoreceptors, have malformed corneal surfaces, and have misshaped, misplaced, and fewer mechanosensory bristles. Corneal nipples, while present in mutant corneas on the corneal surface, are disorganized and malformed. With an average of 30% of the eye territory mutant, flies have a significantly lower response in a behavioral phototaxis assay. Altogether, kay function is required for multiple cell types in the adult retina, and this stands in stark contrast with other jun kinase genes, like the fly homologs of jun kinase and jun, genes not required for adult eye morphogenesis. This is consistent with Kayak functions that are independent of heterodimerizing with Jun proteins or requiring activation of the jun kinase pathway.",

      "content": "Recent work suggests that pointing based assessments may underestimate or mischaracterize perceptual and cognitive abilities in minimally verbal autism (mvASD). Extending this line of work, we address the classic global local question by testing whether mvASD children access global visual structur and whether it is consistently expressed in behavior using Kanizsa illusory contours (KIC) and circular colinear contours (CC). Typically developing (TD) and mvASD children viewed KIC and CC stimuli on a touchscreen while spontaneous eye gaze and pointing were recorded. Participants also completed a goal directed drag and drop matching task that required selecting the solid shape corresponding to the global KIC configuration. In spontaneous responses, mvASD children were more drawn to local elements (e.g., individual inducers, the CC frame, single Gabors) and showed less centralized responding than TD peers. Notably, CC pointing was often anchored to one half of the contour regardless of contour screen location, suggesting object centered global selection. Also, in the drag and drop task, approx. 90% of mvASD participants performed above chance in at least one condition and half performed at ceiling, demonstrating accurate global matching. These findings suggest that global structure is available in mvASD but may be underweighted in spontaneous response selection under ambiguity, consistent with the Affordance Competition Hypothesis and ambiguity resolution accounts.",

      "title": "Dual Engram Architecture within a Single Striatal Cell Type Distinctly Controls Alcohol Relapse and Extinction",
      "content": "Relapse is a major obstacle in the treatment of alcohol and drug addiction and is thought to be driven by persistent drug-associated memories formed during their use. Behavioral therapies such as extinction training can reduce relapse and are proposed to work by creating a competing memory trace. However, where and how these opposing memories are stored in the brain is unknown. Here, we show that two anatomically and functionally distinct engram ensembles within the same genetically defined striatal cell type, direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs), encode these opposing memories. Using engram-tagging tools in mice, we found that the acquisition of operant alcohol learning recruits a dMSN ensemble enriched in the striatal matrix compartment that stores alcohol-associated memories and whose activation selectively promotes relapse. Conversely, extinction of alcohol seeking recruits a dMSN ensemble enriched in the striosome compartment that stores extinction-related memories and whose activation suppresses relapse. Furthermore, we reveal that the physical memory trace storing the relapse-promoting memory is embedded within persistently strengthened corticostriatal synapses engaged during learning, and that artificially reproducing this plasticity is sufficient to trigger relapse-like behavior. These findings uncover a dual-engram architecture within dMSNs that governs relapse and extinction, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how competing memories regulate drug-seeking behavior.",

      "title": "Dose-dependent power and connectivity modulation of low frequency oscillations through transcranial magnetic stimulation in non-human primates.",
      "content": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful non-invasive tool for safely modulating neural activity in humans. In particular, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a common target site for clinical interventions in disorders such as treatment-resistant depression. Yet, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of TMS often lack neural markers of target engagement of the DLPFC. Local field potentials (LFPs), such as prefrontal theta oscillations, have been implicated in the clinical symptoms of these disorders. However, non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in humans are limited by their spatial resolution and challenges of interpreting EEG signals. In this study, we investigate the effects of single-pulse TMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex in non-human primates on LFPs recorded through intracranial EEG. Compared to sham TMS, the intensity of active TMS pulses scaled with LFP power changes in a 1-13 Hz range at contacts close to the stimulation site in the prefrontal cortex (e.g., caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex) as well as contacts that were more distal (e.g., posterior cingulate cortex, temporal lobe). To test how TMS modulates connectivity between these regions, we conducted a phase-based connectivity analysis. TMS pulses initially enhanced and then disrupted connectivity at 1-13 Hz between the stimulation site and other contacts. Connectivity rebounded approximately 1500 ms post-stimulation. Only the initial enhancement in connectivity scaled with TMS intensity. Our results demonstrate a dose-dependent power modulation of low frequency LFPs across prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortical regions by single pulses. Furthermore, they show that TMS applied over the left prefrontal cortex can enhance and interrupt short- and long-range connectivity. Our study advances the understanding of the effects of TMS on brain oscillations and connectivity with direct relevance for clinical applications in neuromodulation therapies.",

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.
