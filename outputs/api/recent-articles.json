      "title": "2-AG as a potential biomarker for predicting response to short-term fluoxetine treatment in a mouse model of depression",
      "content": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric condition with significant individual and social impact and marked variability in treatment response. Identifying biomarkers that predict antidepressant efficacy remains a major challenge, and metabolomic approaches offer a powerful tool to uncover biochemical changes associated with depression and treatment outcome. The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are key brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of MDD and antidepressant response. Fluoxetine, one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants, influences not only serotonergic signaling but also the endocannabinoid system. Accordingly, evaluating endocannabinoid levels in these brain regions might provide critical insight into their contribution to mood disorders and the effect of fluoxetine. To identify biomarkers associated with early antidepressant response, male mice were exposed for 5 weeks to the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) protocol, with fluoxetine treatment administered during the final week. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of hippocampal and prefrontal cortex samples revealed that the depression-like phenotype induced by UCMS was associated with increased hippocampal anandamide (AEA) levels. Behavioral improvement following short-term fluoxetine treatment was accompanied by enhanced hippocampal 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which was associated with reduced GABA and glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that increased 2-AG levels may serve as a predictor of early response to fluoxetine.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "content": "Functional relationships are essential for healthy aging and they rely on social cognition skills such as establishing and monitoring whom to trust. However, aging and loneliness can negatively affect social brain function, potentially leading to a vicious cycle. Using functional MRI and computational modeling we investigated trust learning in a sample of neurotypical older (64-84 years, n=29f/23m) compared to younger adults (20-33 years, n=31f/31m). Older participants displayed lower initial trust and less trust learning when repeatedly interacting with a trustworthy and an untrustworthy trustee. Their basolateral and central amygdala activation was lower during trust decisions, and this was associated with less optimal trust behavior. Computational modeling also revealed that a crucial learning parameter, trust prediction error precision, was decoupled from basolateral amygdala activation, and this effect was pronounced in lonely older adults. These findings indicate that differences in amygdala function and reward signaling at older age and higher loneliness could drive detrimental effects on trust learning, leading to poorer social cognition and putting individuals' sociality and well-being at risk.",

Consequently, our previous research only focused on the network's outputs. However, a detailed analysis of the STLR requires focusing on the synaptic weights themselves. To address this issue, we mapped the synaptic weights to a distance space and analyzed the characteristics of the STLR. The results indicate that the synaptic weights form a fractal-like structure in Euclidean distance space. Furthermore, three analytical approaches\u2014multi-dimensional scaling, estimating fractal dimension, and modeling with an iterated function system\u2014demonstrate that the STLR forms a fractal structure in the synaptic weights through fractal coding. These findings contribute to clarifying the learning mechanisms in the hippocampus.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "What Is a Generative Model? Definitions, Disagreements, and Evaluation in Human Neuroimaging",
      "content": "The term generative model is widely used in human neuroimaging; however, its meaning is often left implicit. Prompted by observations and discussions at the 2025 Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Annual Meeting, we surveyed members of the neuroimaging community to examine how generative models are defined, used, and evaluated in practice. Responses revealed some agreement on functional criteria--such as a model's ability to simulate data--alongside marked disagreement about whether specific, widely used methods should be considered generative models. Evaluative priorities also varied across respondents, though out-of-sample generalization and interpretability were consistently emphasized. Rather than proposing a single definition, this perspective highlights the diversity of current usage and argues for greater clarity when the term is invoked.",

      "title": "Early-Stage Corticostriatal Circuit Hyperactivity Impairs Cholinergic Function and Cognitive Flexibility in an Alzheimer's Model",
      "content": "Cognitive flexibility deficits are a hallmark of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the 5xFAD mouse model of AD neuropathology exhibited early deficits in instrumental reversal learning, indicating cognitive inflexibility preceding spatial memory deficits. This impairment was associated with excessive neuronal reactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS), key regions for goal-directed behavior. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that mPFC neurons in young 5xFAD mice were hyperexcitable and received elevated excitatory input. Moreover, the mPFC-to-direct pathway medium spiny neuron (dMSN) circuit and the dMSNs themselves were selectively hyperactive. These hyperactive dMSNs exerted increased inhibitory control over cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the DMS, coinciding with reduced CIN firing and diminished striatal acetylcholine (ACh) release. Critically, sustained chemogenetic inhibition of the mPFC-to-DMS circuit in 5xFAD mice reduced cortical A{beta} accumulation, normalized glutamatergic transmission in both the mPFC and DMS, restored striatal ACh levels, and rescued reversal learning deficits. Together, these findings identify a hyperactive mPFC-to-DMS circuit that disrupts corticostriatal and cholinergic signaling, contributing to cognitive inflexibility in 5xFAD mice. Targeting this circuit may offer a therapeutic strategy to preserve cognitive function in the early stages of AD.",
