      "title": "Alterations of brain network topology and structural-functional connectivity coupling in noise-induced hearing loss based on macroscopic scale",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the changes in the global attributes of structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) graph theory, as well as the coupling topological structure of the whole brain SC-FC in patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).Methods57 NIHL patients and 55 health controls (HCs) were included; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, clinical data (scales, laboratory indicators) were collected. The graph theory network analysis of SC and FC, the whole-brain SC-FC coupling were performed, and a correlation analysis was employed to analyze the results in relation to the clinical data.ResultsFor FC, there was no significant difference in the global indices directly between groups (P > 0.05, FDR corrected). For SC, the normalized clustering coefficient (\u03b3) and small-worldness (\u03c3) of the NIHL were higher than those of the HCs (P < 0.05, FDR corrected). There was no significant difference in the SC-FC coupling strength of whole brain between two groups (P > 0.05). The graph attribute indices and coupling values of NIHL were correlated to varying degrees with the results of anxiety scale, coagulation, inflammation and biochemical indices (P < 0.05).ConclusionThe brain network topology structure of NIHL patients is abnormal, but the SC-FC coupling strength does not change significantly. This may provide a basis for understanding the theoretical mechanism of brain neural function remodeling and for future more detailed and diverse studies.",

      "title": "Functional organization underlying superior performance in a memory champion",
      "content": "Memory athletes can achieve superior performance (e.g., memorizing 339 digits in 5 minutes) with extensive daily training, by converting abstract information into vivid scenes, and placing them along a mental path, that is then retraced at recall (Method of Loci). Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying such training-dependent performance could suggest novel brain-based approaches to improve learning and cognitive performance in other domains. As each memory athlete uses individual-specific, personalized training techniques, it has been challenging to study them at the group level. Fortunately, precision functional mapping (PFM) which uses repeated sampling of resting state functional connectivity and task fMRI, enables detailed study of individual brains. Here, we map the brain organization of a 6-time U.S. Memory Champion (>13 hours fMRI) and compare it to control data. We observe focal functional connectivity differences in the memory champion's retrosplenial, extrastriate visual, and dorsal frontal cortex (area 55b), as well as in the caudate. These suggest additional recruitment of scene and semantic processing in the athlete, alongside a stronger integration of the caudate with memory-related networks. A control rote memorization task elicits typical activation patterns in the athlete, but when using the Method of Loci, his pattern on activation differs: his hippocampal activation was larger during recall than encoding and he recruited regions showing connectivity differences compared to controls. His unique circuit for Method of Loci, incorporates regions typically used for navigation, scene processing, language and associative learning.",

      "title": "Sexually dimorphic plasticity of PV inhibition in sensory neocortex during learning",
      "content": "Neocortical parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons critically regulate circuit excitation by strong synaptic inputs onto local pyramidal (Pyr) neurons. Plasticity in PV-mediated inhibition during learning could have pronounced effects on gating excitatory synaptic plasticity and circuit excitability, but experimental evidence to support this input- and target-specific plasticity is scant. Here, we combined in vitro electrophysiology with quantitative synapse analysis to determine whether training in a whisker-based sensory-association task could alter PV-mediated inhibition in the primary somatosensory cortex of mice. Using light-evoked activation of channelrhodopsin-expressing PV neurons, we found that evoked PV-IPSCs in Pyr neurons from layer (L) 2/3, but not L5, were rapidly suppressed at the onset of training. This reduction was sex-specific, occurring only in females. The training-related decrease in PV output was accompanied by a reduced number of PV-associated synapses on both the soma and dendrites of L2/3 Pyr neurons, suggesting a postsynaptic structural change. Notably, when whisker stimulation was decoupled from the water reward during pseudotraining, PV-mediated inhibition remained stable. Thus, reduced PV inhibition in superficial layers is an early response to the development of stimulus-reward associations during sensory learning. In addition, these data underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in studies of learning-related cortical plasticity.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

We collected EEG, ECG, and eye-tracking data from 115 children (ASD n =\u202f45, ADHD n =\u202f38, SLD n =\u202f32) during AR-enhanced learning tasks. The multimodal fusion approach achieved 89.3% classification accuracy in identifying disorder-specific patterns. Key biomarkers included frontal theta power variations (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), heart rate variability indices (LF/HF ratio), and fixation duration patterns. AR environments reduced cognitive load by 27% compared to traditional settings while maintaining engagement levels. Personalized intervention based on real-time physiological feedback improved attention performance by 31.2% and social interaction scores by 24.8% over 12\u202fmonths. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of combining AR technology with physiological monitoring for adaptive special education.",

      "content": "BackgroundEmerging evidence indicates that rapid-acting antidepressants (RAADs)\u2014including ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics- may affect myelin homeostasis, aside from producing fast-onset, sustained improvements in several psychiatric disorders.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Europe PMC, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and Google Scholar was conducted up to October 2025 for studies examining the effects of RAADs on myelination and oligodendrocyte biology, as well as associated molecular and cellular mechanisms.Main bodyForty-one studies met the inclusion criteria: 12 in humans, 21 in animals, 7 in vitro, and one computational/theoretical. Thirty studies investigated ketamine and 11 serotonergic RAADs. Across models, RAADs modulate myelination in a dose- and exposure-dependent manner: therapeutic doses generally promote myelin integrity and oligodendrocyte maturation, while high or repeated doses, or neonatal exposure, can disrupt myelin structure and function, impair oligodendrocyte viability, and produce cognitive, affective, and neurotoxic side effects.ConclusionMyelin regulation may represent a component of RAAD action, indicating that these agents could influence myelin biology. Further research is required to clarify the mechanisms underlying these effects, their potential implications for therapies aimed at preserving or restoring myelin integrity, and potential side effects. Their dose-dependent effects highlight the need for careful consideration of dosing and treatment duration.",

      "title": "A systematic review of the effects of brain-computer interface on lower limb motor function, balance function, and activities of daily living in stroke patients",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the effects of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology on lower limb motor function, balance function, and activities of daily living in stroke patients.MethodsThis study followed the PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases, with an additional manual search. The search period was from database inception to March 2024. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the studies, the GRADE system was applied to evaluate the evidence quality for outcome measures, and Meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 17.0 software.ResultsThe systematic review included nine studies. The methodological quality, assessed using the PEDro scale, yielded an average score of 6.9, which corresponds to a moderate-to-low certainty of evidence. The Meta-analysis showed that BCI technology significantly improved lower limb motor function (MD\u202f=\u202f3.52, 95% CI [2.03, 5.00], p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and activities of daily living (MD\u202f=\u202f6.08, 95% CI [1.81, 10.35], p\u202f=\u202f0.01), but had no significant effect on balance function (MD\u202f=\u202f4.82, 95% CI [\u22121.53, 11.16], p\u202f=\u202f0.14). Subgroup analysis showed that the effect size in the acute and subacute phases was 3.89, and in the recovery phase, it was 3.12, both of which were statistically significant. In terms of intervention methods, the effect size for MI-BCI was 2.73, and for BCI-Robot, it was 4.60, both statistically significant. Regarding intervention dosage, the effect size for 2.5\u201310\u202fh was 2.60, and for 12\u201320\u202fh, it was 5.46, both statistically significant.ConclusionCurrent evidence suggests that BCI-based interventions have a beneficial effect on lower limb motor function and activities of daily living in stroke patients. Interventions initiated during the acute or subacute phase, with a total dose exceeding 12\u202fh, appear to be associated with superior outcomes. However, the certainty of this evidence is moderate to low, necessitating further validation. Future research should prioritize large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials to definitively establish the efficacy of BCI technology and elucidate its optimal implementation protocols.",

      "title": "Hybrid deep learning and feature optimization approach for early detection of multiple sclerosis",
      "content": "The healthcare field increasingly relies on autonomous systems for the detection and analysis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) to minimize diagnostic delays, resource burdens, reduce the progression of disability, and enhance clinical decision-making efficiency. Such systems ensure accurate and timely treatment, ultimately improved patient outcomes. In this study, a hybrid framework combining deep learning-based feature extraction, metaheuristic feature selection, and machine learning (ML) classifiers is proposed for accurate MS classification. All MRI images were preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), resizing, and normalization to enhance contrast and standardize the input dimensions. Deep features were extracted using the pretrained VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN), in which the fully connected layers were removed, and the convolutional base was used to obtain high-dimensional features per image. To reduce dimensionality and improve classification performance, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) was employed to select the most discriminative subset of features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based fitness function. Multiple classifiers were then trained and evaluated using the optimized feature set. Among them, the Artificial Neural Network integrated with WOA (ANN+WOA) achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98%, demonstrating the potential of the proposed model for reliable, efficient, and automated MS diagnosis.",

      "title": "Exploring physical and functional EEG connectivity with multilayer graph transformer convolutional networks for emotion recognition",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based emotion recognition has emerged as a compelling direction in affective computing, driven by its ability to provide objective, neural-level insights into emotional states. However, the high-dimensional and complex spatial and functional characteristics of EEG data present substantial challenges for accurate modeling. To address this, we propose Multilayer-GTCN (Multilayer Graph Transformer Convolutional Network), which combines the strengths of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Transformer layers to effectively capture both local and global dependencies in EEG signals. The framework employs a dual-graph design over feature nodes: a physical proximity graph instantiated as a complete topology to stabilize information flow, and a functional connectivity graph whose edges are correlations derived from inter-feature relationships. Within this representation, GCN layers consolidate stable relational patterns, while transformer-based graph convolutions capture long-range dependencies and transient interactions across the feature space. Combining the two encoded views results in representations that jointly capture localized structure and global context, providing a robust basis for affective decoding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving 98.24\u2009\u00b1\u20091.74% on SEED, 95.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.89% on SEED-IV, and 93.35\u2009\u00b1\u20094.08% (valence) / 94.11\u2009\u00b1\u20092.98% (arousal) on DEAP. These results highlight the efficiency and flexibility of Multilayer-GTCN across varied datasets. By merging a physical proximity graph with correlation-based functional connectivity in a multilayer architecture, this study lays a foundation for scalable affective-computing systems and delivers a framework to guide upcoming advances in neural signal study.",

      "title": "Differential arousal and neural engagement for angry and fearful faces: a combined pupillometric and fMRI study",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how emotions are encoded at the neural level remains a central challenge in human neuroscience. Facial expressions are among the most powerful and frequently used stimuli to study emotion processing. Face perception itself is a complex function supported by a core network\u2014including bilateral occipito-fusiform and superior temporal regions\u2014and an extended network involving anterior structures such as the bilateral amygdalae. However, previous findings on how emotional content modulates these networks have been inconsistent.MethodsTo disentangle perceptual and affective components of face emotion processing, we combined high-frequency pupillometry with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Pupillary dilation serves as a sensitive index of two distinct processes: perceptual load, reflecting the informational complexity of a face, and arousal, indicating its immediate sensory impact. In our study, 25 participants (13 female) viewed faces expressing anger, fear, happiness, or neutrality as well as luminance-matched houses serving as control stimuli. A one-back task unrelated to emotion masked the true experimental purpose.ResultsRelative to houses, faces elicited stronger pupillary dilations as well as enhanced blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity in bilateral occipital and fusiform cortices as well as in both amygdalae. Among facial expressions, angry faces evoked the largest pupillary dilations, while fearful faces elicited the strongest neural responses within a right-lateralized network centered on the superior temporal sulcus (rSTS). Across all faces>houses (conjunction minimum-statistic inference), pupil size correlated positively with BOLD activity in the right fusiform gyrus (rFFG), left inferior occipital gyrus (lIOG), bilateral calcarine cortex, and bilateral lingual gyrus.DiscussionThese findings indicate that emotional faces impose a higher perceptual load than matched control stimuli, engaging a distributed network spanning early visual and attention-related areas. In conclusion, our results suggest that emotional quality is specified early in the perceptual process, with divergent pupillary and neural signatures separating arousal-driven threat responses (anger) from socially complex alarm cues (fear).",

      "content": "Naturalistic interactions involve dynamic, nonlinear coordination that unfolds across multiple timescales, yet most hyperscanning studies rely on analytical methods designed for passive, stimulus-locked contexts. We introduce cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA)\u2014a method that treats signals as a coupled dynamical system and characterizes the patterns of their joint trajectories across time\u2014to measure brain-to-brain coupling during a free-flowing negotiation task. Dyads were scanned with fNIRS as they negotiated budget allocations to solve a public health crisis. We measured neural coupling in regions critical for social cognition\u2014medial prefrontal cortex and temporal parietal junction\u2014and related coupling patterns to both objective negotiation behaviors and subjective experiences. While conventional measures of neural synchrony, such as inter-subject correlation and wavelet coherence, showed no relationships with outcomes, CRQA revealed systematic associations between dynamic coupling patterns and successful interaction. We found that balanced neural coordination, where leading and lagging flowed symmetrically between partners, predicted greater collaborative allocation adjustment and more positive social experiences, including shared understanding, cooperation, and liking. Longer delays in neurocognitive coordination, as opposed to immediate alignment, were associated with greater feelings of motivation during the interaction. Finally, greater complexity, or entropy, of neural coupling was linked to more parity in how partners moved toward the joint solution rather than a one-sided accommodation. These findings demonstrate that real social interaction can be captured through analytical methods that account for the dynamic, nonlinear processes being studied, creating new possibilities for understanding how minds connect during natural human interaction.",

      "content": "Intelligent prosthetic hips and knees represent a critical advancement in restoring natural gait and mobility for lower-limb amputees, particularly those with high-level amputations such as hip disarticulation. This systematic review examines recent progress in three fundamental aspects of intelligent prosthetic technology: actuation, perception, and control. In terms of actuation, the review highlights the limitations of passive and active prostheses and discusses emerging hybrid active-passive mechanisms that aim to replicate the natural, biarticular muscle-driven energy transfer in human gait. The perception section addresses current methodologies for recognizing human motion intentions through mechanical, bioelectric, biomechanical, and external environmental signals, underscoring the challenges of stability, latency, and interference inherent in existing approaches. Regarding control strategies, the paper categorizes intelligent control into torque compensation, motion following, and direct intention control, outlining the strengths and limitations of each method. The review identifies critical technological bottlenecks, including signal interference, limited adaptability to dynamic environments, and the absence of effective real-time intention recognition methods. The paper concludes by suggesting future directions in the development of hybrid actuation and advanced perception-control integration, essential for improving the usability and efficacy of intelligent prosthetic hips and knees, ultimately enhancing mobility and quality of life for amputees.",
