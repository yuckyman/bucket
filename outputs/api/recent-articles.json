      "title": "Glucose and Oxygen Metabolism Coordinate Human Cortical Developmental Decisions",
      "content": "Defining metabolic regulation of neurodevelopmental programs is essential to approach developmental disorders and injuries driven by alterations in metabolism. In vitro cultures are the only available method to temporally perturb and study living human brain cells throughout neurogenesis, however most culture systems use supraphysiologic conditions of essential nutrients, glucose and oxygen. We probed how environmental exposure to endogenous-like concentrations impact metabolic state and developmental progression of cortical cell types using organoids. Nutrient accessibility globally impacted metabolic state, yet developmental responses to metabolic changes were cell type-specific. Metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets reveal increased TCA metabolites and amino acids and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, under physiologic glucose conditions. Oxygen level had a modest, yet specific, molecular impact on deep layer excitatory neurons. We assessed consequences of metabolic changes on fate and observed that physiologic glucose expanded the human-enriched population of cortical stem cells, outer radial glia, and their progeny, upper layer excitatory neurons. Alterations in oxygen, instead, affected production of neurogenic progenitors and neuronal differentiation, with higher oxygen availability supporting shifts toward mitochondrial metabolism necessary for maturing cell types. We functionally tested this transition by inhibiting glycolysis; total inhibition promoted neuronal differentiation, whereas inhibition of anaerobic glycolysis/lactate production led to oRG expansion. Lactate signaling was sufficient to suppress oRG development and promote self-renewal of neurogenic progenitors. These data suggest that refined metabolic switches and decreased reliance on glucose are required for transition from stem cell self-renewal to more mature, diversified progenitor subtypes, where switch from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism discretely impacts progenitor diversification.",

      "title": "The 5-HT1A receptor selective agonist NLX-204 displays analgesic activity in the knee osteoarthritis and plantar incisional post-operative pain models in rats",
      "content": "Background: NLX-204 is a highly selective, high efficacy biased agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, which are well-established modulators of pain processing. Objective: To evaluate the analgesic activity of NLX-204 in two rat models of nociceptive/inflammatory pain: the monoiodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and the Brennan's plantar incision model, using morphine as an active comparator, in both male and female rats. Methods: KOA was induced by left intra-articular MIA injection. Analgesic effects of NLX-204 (0.1-3 mg/kg p.o.) or morphine (6 mg/kg s.c.) were assessed on days 5 and 8 by measuring withdrawal threshold (WT) using von Frey filaments and dynamic weight bearing (DWB) on injured and contralateral limbs. In the Brennan's model, the plantar surface of the left hind limb was incised with elevation and incision of the plantaris muscle. Mechanical allodynia (WT) and guarding behavior (GB) were assessed 24 h post-surgery. Results: In the MIA-KOA model, NLX-204 significantly attenuated DWB imbalance in males at 1-3 mg/kg (acute) and 0.1-3 mg/kg (repeated dosing), and in females at 3 mg/kg (repeated dosing only). NLX-204 demonstrated anti-allodynic activity (VF filaments) from 0.3 mg/kg in males (acute and repeated) and from 1 mg/kg in females. In the Brennan's model, NLX-204 reduced GB scores at 1 mg/kg (males) and 0.3-1 mg/kg (females), and showed anti-allodynic effects from 0.3 mg/kg in both sexes. Morphine was effective in both models under acute and repeated administration. Conclusions: Oral NLX-204 demonstrates dose-dependent analgesic and anti-allodynic activity in two rat models of nociceptive/inflammatory pain, supporting the therapeutic potential of selective, high-efficacy 5-HT1A receptor agonists as a novel non-opioid strategy for pain management.",

      "title": "Identification of TREK channels in mouse intracardiac ganglion neurons",
      "content": "The intracardiac nervous system is a complex neural network formed by a diffuse plexus, the so called intracardiac ganglion (ICG). These ganglia locally innervate and control heart function, but little is known about how ICG neuronal activity is regulated. While various ionic currents have been characterized in cardiac tissue, the expression and role of TREK channels in ICG neurons remain unexplored. TWIK-related K+ (TREK) channels, members of the two-pore domain potassium channel family, are essential regulators of neuronal membrane resting potential and excitability, with recognized neuroprotective functions. In this study, we have characterized different ionic currents present in mouse ICG neurons, including tetrodotoxin-sensitive Na currents, delayed K+ rectifiers, Ca+2-dependent K currents and A, H and M currents. Notably, we provide the first evidence of functional TREK channel expression in these neurons. Our findings suggest that TREK channels contribute to excitability control and cellular homeostasis in ICG neurons, underscoring their potential as therapeutic targets for cardiac disorders.",

      "title": "Shifts in attentional demand are accompanied by sex-specific patterns of insula-frontal cortical interactions in mice",
      "content": "The insula is a brain region that is correlated with the cognitive process of attention in humans. Aberrant insula function is also implicated in attentional impairments in several psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia. Although the insulas role in attention has been well-studied in humans, we do not yet have an understanding of how the insula communicates with other brain areas to promote attentional processing. Here, we show that neurons in the mouse insula send direct axonal projections to the frontal cortex, and that these two brain areas functionally interact in different ways between male and female mice performing a touchscreen-based attention task. Specifically, we recorded and analyzed local field potentials (LFPs) from the insula and frontal cortex while mice performed variants of a rodent analogue of the continuous performance test of attention, or rCPT. In male mice, we found that activity in the frontal cortex preceded insular activity when the task was well-learned, but that insula-frontal cortex synchrony decreased when the need to inhibit responding was high. In female mice, synchrony between the insula and frontal cortex was largely bidirectional, but was high during all session types. We further demonstrate that patterns of theta-gamma coupling between the frontal cortex and insula distinguish between correct choices and errors during the rCPT, and that these patterns diverge between sexes. Our results suggest that functional differences in insula-frontal cortical circuitry at least partially underlie sex differences in attention-guided behavior in mice.",

      "title": "Precise, individualized foraging flights in honey bees revealed by multicopter drone-based tracking",
      "content": "Honey bees routinely fly hundreds or thousands of meters between their hive and established foraging locations. To navigate these long distances, they are known to combine both landmark use and path integration and have been hypothesized to build a cognitive map. Due to technical challenges inherent in tracking these small insects, obtaining three-dimensional, high-resolution measurements of individual navigational precision, and thus a detailed understanding of their strategies, has been difficult. Here, we utilize a novel multicopter drone-based tracking system to measure the individual flight paths of honey bees in a structured agricultural landscape at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Although bees could choose from multiple routes, we discovered that individual bees follow idiosyncratic paths with striking and repeatable precision. Flight path variability was highest over visually sparse regions and lowest near prominent proximal landmarks. Furthermore, individual strategies differed: some bees flew directly toward the hive before maneuvering around a specific tree, while others flew directly to a gap between a hedgerow and the tree. Thus, each animal varies in how it uses visual information and selects between behavioral strategies. The level of precision exhibited by their flight paths exceeds that reported in the waggle dance, implying that dance variability does not reflect a limit in the bee's underlying spatial representation. Our results demonstrate the remarkable precision of individual bee navigation and illustrate the potential of this new drone-based tracking method to illuminate fine-scale behavioral mechanisms across a spectrum of honey bee ecology and cognition.",
