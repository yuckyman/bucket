      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Radio frequency (RF)-based human activity sensing is an essential component of ubiquitous computing, with WiFi sensing providing a practical and low-cost solution for gesture and activity recognition. However, challenges such as manual data collection, multipath interference, and poor cross-domain generalization hinder real-world deployment. Existing data augmentation approaches often neglect the biomechanical structure underlying RF signals. To address these limitations, we present CM-GR, a...",

      "content": "The structural integrity of poultry eggs is essential for food safety, economic value, and hatchability. External eggshell quality-measured by thickness, strength, cracks, color, and cleanliness-is a key criterion for grading and sorting. Traditional assessment methods, although simple, suffer from subjectivity, low efficiency, and destructive nature. In contrast, recent developments in nondestructive testing (NDT) technologies have enabled precise, automated, and real-time evaluation of...",

However, conventional vision-based techniques suffer from several limitations, including high data redundancy and strong dependence on image quality. In this work, we present a high-speed, image-free object classification method based on dual-pixel measurement and normalized central moment invariants.
