However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Non-clinical laboratories are under increasing regulatory pressure from agencies such as the FDA, EMA, and MHRA to ensure data integrity, traceability, and compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Documentation Practice (GDP). While Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely explored in clinical diagnostics and drug discovery, its application to non-clinical laboratories, particularly in relation to validation, regulatory alignment, and Technology Readiness Level (TRL), remains...",

A total of 105 samples (35 biodiesel blend levels in triplicate) were analyzed with both the proposed method and the official Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 15568/2008 (FT-IR). While the standard method requires laboratory infrastructure and specialized...",

In this study, we present a non-invasive deep learning approach for optical imaging that predicts fluorescent markers directly from brightfield microscopy images of BSC cultures. Using a convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture, our method simultaneously predicts two key fluorescent signals, specifically DAPI and...",

Autologous fat transfer (AFT) is commonly performed for periorbital rejuvenation and carries a risk of rare but severe ophthalmic complications. We describe a case of unilateral visual loss following periorbital AFT, in which the underlying mechanism was scleral penetration leading to vitreous haemorrhage, retinal incarceration, and extraocular...",
