      "title": "\u03b42-Protocadherins organize parallel indirect basal ganglia circuits",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) contain multiple parallel neural circuits, each of which may control different behaviors. However, how the distinct parallel BG circuits are molecularly organized is not known. Here we show that two {delta}2-protocadherins (PCDHs), PCDH17 and PCDH10, which are homophilic cell-adhesion molecules, establish and define two distinct indirect BG circuits that regulate different behaviors. PCDH17 and PCDH10 are expressed in a complementary expression pattern in the BG, anatomically defining two parallel indirect BG connections. Indirect pathway-specific Pcdh17 and Pcdh10 conditional knockout (cKO) mice show impaired establishment of the indirect BG circuits in a region-preferential manner. Finally, the Pcdh17-cKO mice show defects in task learning, while the Pcdh10-cKO mice show defects in motor/sensory habituation. These results identify PCDH17 and PCDH10 as the molecular organizers for two distinct indirect BG circuits regulating different behaviors and reveal the molecular mechanisms for organizing parallel BG circuits.",

      "title": "Differential Regulation of APOE4-Mediated Astrocytic Lipid Metabolism by BMP Signaling Exacerbates Alzheimers Disease Pathologies in Neurons",
      "content": "The two greatest risk factors for Alzheimers Disease (AD) are aging and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) polymorphism, yet how these factors interact remain unclear. In this study, we investigate how bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, which increases with age, contributes to APOE4-induced lipid metabolic dysfunctions using induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes and cocultured neurons. Surprisingly, BMP signaling differentially altered lipid droplet formation, cholesterol synthesis and breakdown, and fatty acid-oxidation in APOE4 compared to APOE3 astrocytes, and increased secretion of oxidized LDL (oxLDL). Furthermore, neurons cocultured with BMP4-treated APOE4 astrocytes showed altered transcriptomic profiles based on scRNA-seq as well as increased tau phosphorylation (p-tau). oxLDL treatment similarly increased p-tau and reduced neuronal survival. Conversely, lipid uptake inhibition in neurons rescued the BMP4/APOE4 astrocyte-induced neuronal phenotype. These data demonstrate key interactions between APOE4 and aging-associated molecular signaling in AD pathogenesis and establish a causal linkage between astrocytic lipid metabolism and neuronal tau hyperphosphorylation.",

      "title": "Satellite microglia gate neuronal excitability by shielding inhibitory synapses in adult brain",
      "content": "Microglia, the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, are known for sculpting excitatory neural circuits via dynamic processes. However, their role in modulating inhibitory synaptic connections in adulthood remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified an underappreciated microglia subpopulation, satellite microglia with physical soma-soma contact with neurons, that reshape inhibitory circuit connectivity and gate neuronal activity by shielding inhibitory synapses in the adult mouse brain. Using chronic in vivo two-photon imaging in adult mice, we observed in real time that satellite microglia associations displaced perisomatic inhibitory synapses whereas their dissociation permitted inhibitory synaptogenesis. Redistribution of satellite microglia reorganized inhibitory connectivity, altered local neural networks and changed behaviors. These findings establish satellite microglia as key architects of inhibitory circuitry and suggest their broader role in neural plasticity in health and disease.",

      "title": "A bifunctional optical reporter for tracking estrogen response dynamics in neurons",
      "content": "Estrogens are inherently dynamic signaling molecules whose fluctuations induce profound shifts in physiology and behavior. However, methods for tracking the dynamics of estrogen action in vivo are limited and not tissue-specific, making it difficult to directly relate dynamics to ongoing physiological, behavioral, and neural changes. Traditionally, estrogen sensitive cells have been identified by metrics such as receptor expression or radioactive ligand binding, but these measures do not capture the dynamic nature of hormone response. In addition, current methods for assessing the dynamics of estrogens in an individual, including microdialysis and vaginal cytology, lack temporal and spatial resolution.To address this need we developed a bifunctional reporter called neuro-seeER (neuronal see Estrogen Response) that can be used to track changes in exogenous and endogenous estrogen dynamics in vitro and in vivo, including longitudinally in behaving animals. We confirmed that the fluorescent response requires estrogen receptor expression, is specific to activation with estradiol, and is consistent with the timescale of transcriptional induction. Neuro-seeER expression in the hypothalamus of Esr1-Cre mice revealed dynamic labeling of estrogen-responsive cells following treatment with exogenous estradiol, and fluorescence-aided cell sorting followed by RNA-sequencing confirmed that high neuro-seeER response is associated with enriched expression of genes associated with endogenous estrogen responses. Using a novel \"snapshot\" photometry method to track the dynamics longitudinally in vivo, we demonstrate that we can robustly detect exogenous estrogen response across multiple hypothalamic sites simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that this tool is uniquely suited to capturing endogenous estrogen response dynamics in vivo across the long timescale of the estrous cycle, revealing individual differences in neural estrogen dynamics. Together, these findings reveal unexpected cellular and temporal heterogeneity of the transcriptional response and demonstrate the feasibility of tracking the dynamics of hormonal response alongside additional neural, cell signaling, or behavioral measures.",

      "title": "Functional brain network analysis in patients with upper-limb spasticity after stroke",
      "content": "IntroductionStroke ranks as the second leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with the resulting upper-limb spasticity severely impairing patients\u2019 motor function and quality of life. However, existing clinical assessment scales exhibit a degree of subjectivity, and research into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying spasticity remains insufficient. Brain network analysis offers a novel perspective for investigating the neural mechanisms associated with spasticity.MethodsEight patients with upper limb spasticity due to stroke (MAS grades 1\u20132) and eight healthy controls were enrolled. Multi-channel EEG signals were recorded during different upper limb movements (fist clenching, elbow flexion, wrist flexion). Functional brain networks were constructed using the weighted phase delay index, and further calculations were performed on relevant brain network characteristics, including node degree, global efficiency, local efficiency, clustering coefficient, and small-world properties.ResultsResearch findings indicate that functional connectivity in spasticity patients is significantly lower than in healthy subjects, particularly in the alpha and beta frequency bands, with weaker cross-regional synchrony in frontal, central, and temporal lobe regions. Graph theory analysis further reveals that compared to healthy controls, spasticity patients exhibit significantly reduced global efficiency, local efficiency, and clustering coefficient, while small-world properties remain relatively preserved. Node degree analysis revealed abnormal compensatory activation in temporal and parietal regions, whereas healthy participants exhibited higher node degrees in central and frontal areas. These findings suggest that spasticity is associated with impaired local and global network integration, accompanied by inefficient compensatory mechanisms.DiscussionThis study provides new evidence that post-stroke upper limb spasticity is not only a peripheral muscle phenomenon but also reflects disturbances in cortical network dynamics. Brain network metrics, particularly global and local efficiency, may serve as objective biomarkers to quantify spasticity severity and guide personalized rehabilitation interventions, offering a promising direction for developing precision rehabilitation strategies.",

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Association between hippocampal subfield volumes and working memory in middle-aged and older adult cancer patients",
      "content": "BackgroundCancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is relatively common among middle-aged and older adult cancer patients, with working memory deficits being particularly prominent. However, the underlying structural basis of hippocampal subregions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate differences in hippocampal subfield volumes and working memory function between cancer patients and healthy controls, as well as to analyze the correlation between hippocampal structural alterations and working memory impairment.MethodsThe cohort comprised 51 cancer patients and 45 healthy controls. All participants underwent 3D-T1 structural MRI scans and cognitive assessments. Hippocampal subfields were automatically segmented using FreeSurfer 7.4, and their volumes were calculated. Group differences in cognitive test scores were compared. After controlling for total intracranial volume (TIV), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to examine differences in hippocampal subfield volumes between groups. Spearman correlation analysis was undertaken to assess the relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and cognitive test scores in patients with cancer.ResultsCompared with healthy controls, cancer patients exhibited significantly lower scores in the digit span test (DST) total score (U\u2009=\u2009716.50, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and digit span forward (DSF) subtest (U\u2009=\u2009738.50, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Hippocampal subfield analysis revealed significant volume reductions in the cancer group, particularly in CA3 (F\u2009=\u20098.141, p\u2009=\u20090.005) and CA4 (F\u2009=\u20096.770, p\u2009=\u20090.011). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the volumes of the hippocampal head (r\u2009=\u20090.410, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and hippocampal molecular layer (r\u2009=\u20090.389, p\u2009=\u20090.005) were positively associated with DST scores in cancer patients.ConclusionCancer patients exhibit working memory impairment and hippocampal subfield atrophy. The significant correlation between the volumes of the hippocampal head and molecular layer with working memory performance suggests that these regions may play a critical role in cancer-related cognitive dysfunction.",

      "content": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria are essential organelles that interact closely at specialized sites known as ER-mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). MAM is enriched with proteins from both the ER and mitochondria. ER stress sensors\u2014inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) \u2014 are traditionally recognized for their roles in the unfolded protein response (UPR), which mitigates proteotoxic stress. However, recent studies reveal their non-canonical functions at MAMs, where they regulate calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, and apoptosis through interactions with MAM-resident proteins. Disruption of these pathways is implicated in various diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders. This review highlights the emerging roles of IRE1 and PERK in preserving mitochondrial function and their relevance to neurodegeneration. It also examines pharmacological strategies targeting these proteins, which influence both UPR signaling and ER-mitochondrial communication, offering a comprehensive perspective on their roles in health and disease.",

      "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most prevalent form of dementia, affects more than 50 million individuals worldwide and demands accurate and timely diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. Traditional machine-learning approaches for AD detection using MRI often rely on manual feature extraction, which is labor-intensive and limits scalability. There is a growing need for automated, high-accuracy methods that can support clinical workflows and respond to the expected tripling of AD cases by 2050.MethodsThis study proposes an automated feature-extraction approach using a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to brain MRI scans. Extracted deep features were classified using three different algorithms: Softmax, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Performance was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: ADNI and MIRIAD.ResultsAmong the tested models, the ResNet50-Softmax combination demonstrated the highest performance, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks (85.7%\u201398.59%). It achieved 99% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and an overall 99% accuracy on the ADNI dataset. On the MIRIAD dataset, the model also performed strongly, reaching 96% accuracy.DiscussionThe results confirm that transfer learning using ResNet50 significantly enhances the accuracy and scalability of AD diagnosis from MRI data. By eliminating the need for manual feature extraction and offering near-perfect classification performance, this approach can streamline clinical neuroimaging workflows. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning models to support early diagnosis and meet the increasing global burden of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

      "content": "The increasing need for ethical, human-relevant, and efficient alternatives to animal testing is driving the development of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) in safety assessment and drug development. However, the inherent complexity of neurological diseases presents a significant challenge to fully replace animal models in this field. In neuroscience, a range of NAMs, from traditional 2D cell cultures to advanced brain organoids and alternative vertebrate models like zebrafish, demonstrate complementary strengths and limitations. Together, these models support translational research, including the investigation of neurodevelopment, disease, and neurotoxicity. While human and mouse brain organoids that mimic the structural and functional properties of mammalian brain tissue hold great promise, their applicability for high-throughput screening is hindered by their cost- and time-intensive nature. Complementary approaches such as embryonic and larval zebrafish models and the emerging zebrafish brain organoids provide faster, cost-effective, and scalable yet biologically relevant platforms for early-phase screening, thanks to the zebrafish\u2019s rapid development, conserved vertebrate neuroanatomy, and proven value in toxicology. This review maps the current landscape of NAMs in neuroscience, examining approaches ranging from 2D and 3D in vitro systems to zebrafish models. It highlights the advantages and challenges of the different models, including a comparison of human, mouse, and zebrafish brain organoids, and outlines the future directions for integrating these complementary systems into robust, efficient, and ethically responsible pipelines for both early-phase toxicity testing and drug discovery.",
