      "title": "Hypovolemia Evokes Conserved Inverse Neurovascular Coupling in the Supraoptic Nucleus Independent of Heart Failure",
      "content": "Vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) are activated by systemic challenges that threaten fluid balance. Beyond their classical activity-dependent release of their neuropeptide cargo into the systemic circulation, these neurons also release AVP somatodendritically, enabling local modulation of neuronal excitability and vascular tone. We previously showed that a systemic salt challenge triggers inverse neurovascular coupling (iNVC) in the SON, in which activity-dependent dendritic AVP release induces parenchymal arteriole vasoconstriction and local hypoxia. In rats with heart failure (HF), however, the polarity of this salt-evoked response is reversed: microglia-derived adenosine acting on A2A receptors overrides an enhanced AVP-mediated vasoconstriction, producing net vasodilation. Still, whether AVP activation by non-osmotic stimuli engages similar neurovascular mechanisms is unknown. Here, we examined whether hypovolemia induced by intraperitoneal polyethylene glycol (PEG) evokes comparable vascular responses in control and HF rats. PEG produced a sustained rise in plasma protein concentration and vasoconstriction of SON parenchymal arterioles in both control and sham rats. In HF rats, PEG still induced vasoconstriction at 60 min, but vascular diameters returned to baseline by 90 min despite persistent hypovolemia. These findings indicate that hypovolemia engages a conserved AVP-mediated iNVC program that remains largely intact in HF, and that the previously described polarity reversal during HF is stimulus-specific, emerging during osmotic but not hypovolemic activation of AVP neurons.",

      "title": "Injury-induced tau pathology promotes aggressive behavior in Drosophila without neurodegeneration.",
      "content": "The microtubule-associated protein tau is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, but its physiological roles remain poorly understood. Here, we find that pan-neuronal expression of human tau (HsTau) in Drosophila coupled with injury triggers hyper-aggression in male flies, which is absent in flies expressing non-phosphorylatable tau. These behavioral manifestations result from activation of dopaminergic circuits without neurodegeneration. Using in vitro reconstitution assays, we find that phosphorylated HsTau maintains microtubule binding but loses its ability to suppress catastrophes, thereby promoting microtubule dynamicity. In contrast, unphosphorylated HsTau and fly tau (DmTau) stabilize microtubules by reducing catastrophe frequency. Our findings challenge the canonical view of tau as a simple microtubule stabilizer and instead position it as a dynamic regulator of microtubule function and neuronal excitability. These results reveal how acute tau phosphorylation can alter neural circuit function and behavior prior to neurodegeneration, providing new insights into tau's physiological and pathological roles.",

      "title": "Sensory Circuit Dynamics in a Mouse Model of Epileptic Encephalopathy",
      "content": "Epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) are severe developmental disorders with abnormal EEG activity that worsens neurodevelopmental deficits, yet underlying sensory and cognitive impairment mechanisms are unclear. We studied cortical circuit dynamics in Ank3-1b mutant mice, an EE model with parvalbumin interneuron dysfunction, using laminar electrophysiology, spike-field coherence (SFC), single-unit analyses, and behavioral assays. Ank3-1b mutant mice showed disrupted excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, with reduced sink/source ratios (p = 0.0279) and elevated net currents (AVREC; p < 0.01), indicating hyperexcitability. In awake states, sensory-evoked intra-columnar connectivity was impaired, with lower Pearson correlations (p < 0.001) and increased low-frequency (3-30 Hz) SFC (p < 0.001), but intact gamma-band coherence, suggesting aberrant synchronization. Inhibitory neuron latencies were delayed in infragranular layers under anesthesia (p < 0.001) and supragranular layers when awake (p = 0.005), implying thalamocortical deficits. Despite preserved sensory adaptation and recognition memory, Ank3-1b mutant mice exhibited heightened anxiety (p < 0.05) and variable circadian rhythms, indicating selective affective and regulatory deficits. These results show that Ank3-1b loss disrupts cortical E/I balance and synchrony, delaying sensory processing, while compensatory mechanisms maintain critical sensory functions. This study links ANK3 mutations to layer-specific circuit dysfunction, offering insights into EE pathophysiology and sensory deficits.",

      "title": "Vascular dementia increases levels of methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase and cystathionine \u03b2-synthase in female patients and changes gene expression of acetylcholine and glutamate clathrin-sculpted transport vesicles",
      "content": "Deficiencies in one-carbon (1C) metabolism are linked to the onset of vascular dementia (VaD). Our previous work using mouse models has demonstrated that reduced dietary intake of folic acid or genetic deficiencies in 1C metabolism result in worse outcomes using a model of VaD. This study aims to provide a detailed molecular portrait of 1C metabolism within the context of VaD, shedding light on potential molecular mechanisms. In cortical post-mortem tissue from female and male VaD patients and controls we measured the folate receptor (FR) and 1C enzymes including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), cystathionine {beta}-synthase (CBS), with NeuN and DAPI as markers. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics was performed on 4 samples. VaD and gender impacted levels of FR. Both male and female VaD had increased levels of ChAT. Female VaD patients had higher levels of MTHFR and CBS when compared to males. Spatial transcriptomics revealed reduced expression of the glutamate and acetylcholine clathrin-sculpted transport vesicles and increase in glutamatergic neurons. VaD is a complex disease; the results of this study demonstrate that VaD impacts levels of 1C, as well as gene expression. Dietary sup-plementation with 1C may be beneficial for affected patients.",

      "title": "Temporal Dynamics of Complement Activation and Outcome in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke",
      "content": "Immune-mediated inflammatory responses exacerbate brain injury and affect the prognosis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We characterized longitudinal complement activation after AIS using serial plasma samples from 10 patients and 8 controls. Initial markers of classical (C1q), lectin (mannose-binding lectin [MBL]), and alternative (Factor Bb [CFBb]) pathways, as well as regulatory (Factor H [CFH]) and downstream markers (C3a, C5a and C5b-9) were measured by ELISA at 9 time points. Stroke patients showed broad complement activation with increased C1q, MBL, CFBb, C3a, C5a, and C5b-9, and reduced CFH. C1q, MBL, and CFBb peaked around day 17. MBL was higher in patients with poor outcome, CFBb was higher with good outcome, and C5b-9 in severe strokes. These findings reveal pathway-specific complement dynamics after AIS and support complement as a target for stage-specific therapy.",
