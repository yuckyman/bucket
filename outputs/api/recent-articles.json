      "title": "Resolving Heterogeneity in Major Depression: Overcoupling and Undercoupling Subtypes Exhibit Differential Treatment Response and Molecular Pathways",
      "content": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibits significant heterogeneity whose neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. Alterations in morphological-functional coupling (MFC) have been observed in MDD. This study aims to investigate MDD subtypes based on MFC alterations and their associations with clinical symptoms and molecular basis. We identified two clinically distinct MDD subtypes in multi-center neuroimaging data (Discovery: 828 MDD/776 healthy controls; Validation: 236 MDD/86 healthy controls) by using a semi-supervised machine learning approach based on MFC changes, which were validated and robustly repeated in the validation dataset. Differences among subtypes were then examined in relation to clinical assessments, gene expression patterns, neurotransmitter and cell density, and treatment response. Subtype I (overcoupling) showed elevated MFC in high-order association cortices, linking to synaptic transmission activity and severe symptoms. Subtype II (undercoupling) demonstrated reduced MFC in primary cortices, associated with cell cycle regulation and treatment resistance. Both subtypes shared molecular signatures (cell types: astrocytes and oligodendrocytes; neurotransmitter systems: serotonergic and GABAergic receptors). Crucially, longitudinal data (33 MDD undergoing Escitalopram monotherapy) revealed that undercoupling subtype exhibited better response, implying a potential mechanism of the drug via increasing the MFC. Our work deciphers MFC-driven MDD phenotypes with distinct molecular profiles and differential treatment outcomes, suggesting potential pathways for personalized diagnosis and treatment strategies in MDD, advancing precision psychiatry.",

      "title": "Continuous Flash Suppression responses in mouse visual cortex: stimulus laterality and anesthesia effects",
      "content": "We investigated whether binocularly conflicting stimuli adapted from primate binocular rivalry studies could induce binocular response suppression in mouse visual cortex. We presented binocularly conflicting stimuli adapted from the paradigm of continuous flash suppression to awake and anesthetized mice and examined neuronal responses in visual areas V1 and LM. Neurons often showed a preference for the left or right eye where a monocular grating was presented, and their responses were modulated by presenting a conflicting flashing Mondrian stimulus to the other eye. The direction of this modulation depended on whether neurons preferentially responded to contralateral or ipsilateral gratings. Responses of cells with a preference for ipsilateral gratings were suppressed during binocular conflict, while contralateral-preferring cells were less suppressed or even enhanced by binocular conflict. Binocular conflict modulation continued to occur under anesthesia, but response recovery after intermittent binocular conflict only occurred in awake mice. Responses to Mondrians were modulated by binocular conflict in a similar fashion as those to grating stimuli, which suggests that mouse binocular conflict processing exhibits a distinctive dependency on stimulus laterality over other stimulus features. Finally, a canonical binocular rivalry model could be successfully fitted to our data but lacked sufficient competitive inhibition and adaptation strength to create oscillatory activity under binocular conflict.",

      "title": "The Icelandic mutation APPA673T on amyloid-\u03b2 plaque burden in the 5xFAD Alzheimer model",
      "content": "The protective Icelandic mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, APPA673T, identified in Icelandic and other Nordic populations is associated with a significantly lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conflicting results have been reported for the APPA673T mutation in various knock-in models of AD, but its effect in 5x familial AD (5xFAD) mice has never been investigated. We have crossed C57Bl6/J mice expressing a single point mutation edited into the murine APP gene via CRISPR-Cas gene editing, termed APPA673T, with 5xFAD mice that overexpress human APP carrying the Swedish (K670N/M671L), Florida (I716V), and London (V717I) mutations as well as human presenilin-1 (PS1) with two mutations (M146L and L286V); the resulting mice were termed 5xFADxAPPA673T. We have investigated amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) pathology in 5xFADxAPPA673T, 5xFAD and their respective controls, APPA673T and C57Bl6/J wild types at 6-months of age using immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and ELISAs. We found a moderate yet significant reduction for A{beta} plaque size in male 5xFADxAPPA673T compared to 5xFAD. No differences were observed for soluble/insoluble A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 levels per se, but lower plaque count/area was found in 5xFADxAPPA673T when A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratios were low, suggesting a genotype-dependent sensitivity to A{beta} aggregation and accumulation. Therefore, the APPA673T mutation has the potential to modify A{beta} pathology in 5xFAD mice at the age of 6 months.",

      "title": "A spatial transcriptomic atlas of autism-associated genes identifies convergence in the developing human thalamus",
      "content": "Autism is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition that manifests across a wide phenotypic spectrum. Rare and de novo loss-of-function mutations strongly predispose to autism and co-occurring developmental and intellectual disabilities in over 10% of autistic individuals. Understanding whether these variants converge on specific regional brain circuits or widely alter human brain development is crucial to understanding the etiology of profound autism. To date, transcriptomic atlases have mainly implicated the developing cerebral cortex, yet other brain areas have received relatively little attention. Here, we present a single-cell resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of 250 autism susceptibility genes during human brain development. Profiling over 10 million cells across the midgestation forebrain, we found convergence of these genes across a small number of regional programs. The developing thalamus showed the most prevalent expression of autism susceptibility genes, followed by germinal zones throughout the brain. Within the thalamus, excitatory neurons showed the most enriched expression, which varied across thalamic nuclei harboring distinct circuits. Across the germinal zones, neural progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences that generate parvalbumin- and somatostanin-positive interneurons showed highest expression. Our findings reveal the prevalent expression of autism associated genes beyond the developing cerebral cortex and implicate the developing human thalamus as a major hub of autism susceptibility.",

      "content": "Intermanual transfer refers to the improvement of motor skill in an untrained contralateral limb following unilateral limb practice. However, it remains uncertain whether motor skill in the lower limb (LL) can improve as a result of practice with the unilateral upper limb (UL). Forty-five healthy participants were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) UL group, which practiced reaching movement (RM) sequences with the non-dominant left upper limb; or (2) switches observation (SO) group, which observed the same RM sequences; or (3) nature observation (NO) group, which observed nature movies. RM performance with the LL was assessed before, immediately after, and 24 h post-intervention. Response time of RM sequences was faster in the UL group than the NO group in the posttest. Response time improved significantly in the posttest and retest compared to the pretest in all groups, but it improved significantly in the retest compared to the posttest only in the NO group. The percentage of fails to reach within 1 s decreased across all time points in all groups. The combination of practice of the RM sequence with the UL and the cognitive engagement during RM sequence observation contributes to ipsilateral transfer from the UL to the LL.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "content": "IntroductionResting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) presents a promising biometric modality due to its inherent liveness detection and resistance to spoofing, addressing critical vulnerabilities in conventional systems. However, its deployment faces fundamental trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and hardware efficiency, particularly concerning optimal electrode configuration, discriminative feature extraction, and classifier generalization.MethodsTo address these challenges, this study systematically evaluates thirteen entropy measures\u2014including spectral entropy (SpEn), refined composite multiscale entropy, fuzzy entropy, and sample entropy (SaEn) etc.\u2014alongside six classifiers (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forests and Support Vector Machines etc.) for person authentication. Using 32-channel EEG recordings from 26 healthy participants under rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), we quantified the impact of electrode selection and feature-classifier pairing.ResultsKey findings demonstrate: QDA classifier achieved peak performance of 96.8% accuracy using 30 electrodes. Critically, a streamlined 9-electrode portable configuration retained 96.1% accuracy, demonstrating robust performance with reduced hardware requirements. SpEn measure exhibited superior biometric discriminability compared with other entropy measures, exceeding SaEn by 13.8 percentage points.ConclusionThese results advance the design of portable EEG biometric devices while highlighting entropy features\u2019 scalability.",

      "content": "Understanding how the human brain differentiates between active engagement and passive observation is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. Using a matched-stimulus driving paradigm to isolate engagement from sensory input, we recorded whole-brain EEG while participants performed a manual control task and passively viewed a replay of their own performance. Manual control elicited distinct spectral signatures, including stronger frontal midline theta power and, paradoxically, greater occipital alpha power, consistent with heightened cognitive control and active attentional filtering. While a classifier could distinguish these states with high within-subject accuracy, performance declined in cross-subject validation, highlighting inter-individual variability. These findings delineate the distinct neural signatures of active versus passive engagement under controlled conditions. This work establishes a foundational neurophysiological baseline that can inform research on cognitive state monitoring and the design of neuroadaptive systems in complex human-machine interaction.",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
