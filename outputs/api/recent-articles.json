      "title": "Map of spiking activity underlying change detection in the mouse visual system",
      "content": "Visual behavior requires coordinated activity across hierarchically organized brain circuits. Understanding this complexity demands datasets that are both large-scale (sampling many areas) and dense (recording many neurons in each area). Here we present a database of spiking activity across the mouse visual system--including thalamus, cortex, and midbrain--while mice perform an image change detection task. Using Neuropixels probes, we record from >75,000 high-quality units in 54 mice, mapping area-, cortical layer-, and cell type-specific coding of sensory and motor information. Modulation by task-engagement increased across the thalamocortical hierarchy but was strongest in the midbrain. Novel images modulated cortical (but not thalamic) responses through delayed recurrent activity. Population decoding and optogenetics identified a critical decision window for change detection and revealed that mice use an adaptation-based rather than image-comparison strategy. This comprehensive resource provides a valuable substrate for understanding sensorimotor computations in neural networks.",

      "title": "A simple, open-source restraint system for magnetic resonance imaging in awake rats",
      "content": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical tool for translational neuroscience, offering cross-species insights into brain structure and function; however, its application in preclinical research is constrained by routine anesthesia use or sedation, which alters neural activity and limits comparisons to awake human imaging. Awake rodent functional MRI (fMRI) provides a powerful platform for investigating brain function under physiologically relevant conditions, but implementation is limited by technical challenges, particularly head motion and stress during scanning. Most restraint systems employ initial anesthesia, compromising translatability of findings, and highlighting the need for improved designs. We developed a novel restraint system optimized for awake rat fMRI. The system consists of modular 3D-printed components and can be assembled in under five minutes. It is accompanied by a protocol that includes head-post implantation followed by an 11-day habituation period post-surgical recovery. The system eliminates the need for isoflurane anesthesia, ear bars, and bite bars, reducing stress and improving animal comfort. It supports integration with behavioral paradigms such as pupil tracking and licking responses. High-resolution T2-weighted anatomical images and functional scans obtained using the system showed excellent spatial clarity and minimal motion artifacts. Quality control metrics, including head motion parameters and temporal signal-to-noise ratio, confirmed the system's stability and suitability for awake imaging. Functional connectivity analysis revealed robust positive correlations between functionally relevant regions. This system offers a scalable, reproducible, and animal-friendly solution for awake rat fMRI. While the current design limits direct cranial access for multimodal recordings, it enables high-quality, behaviorally enriched imaging without anesthesia.",

      "content": "Unimodal brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often suffer from inherent limitations due to the characteristic of using single modalities. While hybrid BCIs combining electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer complementary advantages, effectively integrating their spatiotemporal features remains a challenge due to inherent signal asynchrony. This study aims to develop a novel deep fusion network to achieve synergistic integration of EEG and fNIRS signals...",
