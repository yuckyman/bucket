      "title": "Resolving temporal threat uncertainty by observational learning involves the amygdala, hippocampus and anterior insula",
      "content": "While the neurobiological distinction between temporally predictable (cued) and unpredictable (contextual) threats has been well-characterized in direct learning using the NPU paradigm, it is poorly understood how these processes unfold during observational learning, a key mechanism of human threat-learning. In this study, we developed a novel observational paradigm based on the NPU paradigm (Experiment 1, n=20, male and female) and combined it with fMRI (Experiment 2, n=23, male and female) to investigate how the brain encodes predictable and unpredictable threat cues observed in others. Participants learned predictable (P), unpredictable (U), and no-threat (N) cues by observation and encountered the same threat cues during an expression phase. Threat expectations indicated that participants successfully learned threat contingencies, showing heightened threat expectations for predictable cues and unpredictable contexts. This converged with neural responses in the anterior insula during the expression phase. Reflecting the dynamic process of learning, the amygdala responded to predictable threat cues with a linear decrease across trials. Interestingly, we found that learning to predict threats from others pain was accompanied by enhanced neural response within the amygdala, insula and hippocampus, as compared to unpredictable conditions. Our findings suggest that humans learn to resolve temporal uncertainty relying solely on observation. The ability to learn shapes the neural response to an observed threat.",

      "title": "Astrocytic PIEZO activation by heartbeat sound promotes extracellular matrix and maturation in human brain organoids",
      "content": "Heartbeat sound is one of the first rhythmic stimuli encountered by the developing human brain, yet its biological role has remained unexplored. Here we show that heartbeat sound promotes structural and functional maturation of human cortical organoids with a physiological astrocyte-to-neuron ratio. Continuous stimulation with heartbeat expanded the extracellular space (ECS), visualized by super-resolution 3D STED and 2-photon shadow imaging, and increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis, detected by LC-MS/MS proteomics. Heartbeat sound promoted neuronal and astrocytic differentiation, synaptogenesis, and organoid maturation, as shown by single-cell RNA sequencing, synaptic marker immunohistochemistry, and high-density multielectrode electrophysiology. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated astrocyte-specific expression of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels. Using Ca2+ imaging, we confirmed that low-frequency sound stimulation, including heartbeat, activates PIEZO-mediated Ca2+ responses, which in turn upregulate astrocytic ECM synthesis. Experiments with biomimetic hydrogels demonstrated that physiological matrix stiffness attenuates PIEZO activation, suggesting a mechanoprotective mechanism. Our findings demonstrate a fundamental mechanism for inducing ECM synthesis and neural differentiation through astrocytic PIEZO activation by heartbeat sound, suggesting that interoception of the internal acoustic environment is an underappreciated driver of human brain development.",

      "content": "Despite decades of research on goal-directed behavior in primates, our understanding of frontal cortical circuits in natural social contexts remains very limited. Classic studies with macaques revealed rich motor representations in both ventral premotor (PMv) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), but the limitations imposed by constrained tasks offered a limited window to investigate the complexity of natural behaviors and social interactions. Freely-moving wireless electrophysiological recordings allowed us to investigate the involvement of these areas during different spontaneous behaviors, including social affiliative interactions, and revealed a robust encoding of the social context of motor actions in both PMv and vlPFC. This provides novel evidence that the frontal lobe integrates social information in naturalistic settings, bridging motor control and social cognition, highlighting the need for ecological neuroscience approaches.",

      "title": "Musicianship and active musical engagement predict facilitation of auditory-motor plasticity: evidence from auditory-motor paired associative stimulation",
      "content": "Abstract: Background and Aim: Auditory motor paired associative stimulation (PAS) probes experience dependent plasticity in auditory motor circuits. We tested whether musical experience and musical sophistication modulate PAS induced facilitation when instrument tones are paired with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex. Method: Sixteen musicians and thirteen non-musicians completed two sessions. Session 1 estimated an individualized inter-stimulus interval (ISI) by testing seven tone TMS delays (25 to 300 ms). Session 2 applied PAS at the optimal ISI. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from right first dorsal interosseus at baseline and post-intervention. Group comparisons and a stepwise multiple regression with Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold MSI) subscales evaluated predictors of the PAS effect. Results: A stepwise multiple regression model selected Group and Active Engagement (Gold MSI Factor 1) as independent predictors (F (2,26) = 4.59, p = 0.020, adjusted R2 = 0.204), without interaction: musicians exhibited smaller facilitation than non-musicians, and higher Active Engagement predicted greater facilitation across groups. Discussion: The lack of facilitation in musicians contrasts with somatosensory PAS reports of enhanced plasticity in experts. A modality specific ceiling effect may contribute, whereby long term training optimizes auditory motor transmission, reducing headroom for facilitation. The association with Active Engagement suggests motivational/reward mechanisms potentially dopaminergic gate responsiveness to auditory motor PAS. Conclusion: Under this protocol, auditory motor PAS with instrument tones facilitated corticospinal excitability in non-musicians but not in musicians. Individual differences in Active Engagement predicted facilitation, indicating that both group membership and active musical engagement shape susceptibility to auditory motor associative plasticity.",

      "title": "Elevated activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system promotes feeding during pregnancy in mice",
      "content": "The pregnancy period is accompanied by increased feeding behavior to accommodate the elevated energy demands associated with fetal growth and development. However, the underlying neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms mediating increased feeding during pregnancy are largely unknown. Here, we utilize a combination of fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and mouse behavioral assays to characterize altered feeding behavior during pregnancy in mice. We uncover that pregnancy increases the activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system during both homeostatic and hedonic feeding behavior in mice. VTA dopamine neurons are ultimately required for promoting increased hedonic feeding during pregnancy as inhibition of these cells selectively reduces acute high fat diet intake in pregnant mice. Further, pregnant mice exhibit increased sensitivity to food deprivation, an effect which requires activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Together, these findings provide a circuit basis mediating altered hedonic feeding behavior and sensitivity to negative energy balance during pregnancy in mice.",

      "title": "The serotonin 1B receptor modulates striatal activity differentially based on behavioral context",
      "content": "The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is critical for goal-directed behavior and has been implicated in both motivating and inhibiting behavioral responses. The DMS circuitry is complex as it integrates multiple inputs from the cortex, thalamus, and other subcortical structures including midbrain dopamine neurons. Though less studied, serotonin neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus also richly innervate the DMS, which expresses the majority of the 14 receptor subtypes for serotonin. In particular, slice electrophysiology shows that the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) impacts DMS physiology and plasticity, and behavioral experiments show that 5-HT1BR expression modulates impulsivity and other DMS-dependent reward-related behaviors. In these studies, our goal was to investigate the effects of 5-HT1BR on the DMS in vivo during goal-directed behavior in mice. Using a genetic 5-HT1BR loss-of-function model, we examined the calcium activity of individual medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the DMS during operant tasks of responding and waiting. We found that knockout of 5-HT1BRs resulted in a significant reduction of excitatory calcium responses and an increase in the proportion of cells with inhibitory calcium responses following receipt of a reward. This suggests that serotonin may recruit MSN activity in response to reward via actions at 5-HT1BRs. On the other hand, in a behavioral paradigm designed to test impulsivity, we found that serotonin may inhibit DMS calcium activity through 5-HT1BRs. Specifically, mice lacking 5-HT1BR expression had a larger proportion of cells showing increased calcium responses during the waiting period of the trial, compared to controls. These results point to the importance of in vivo studies to understand the functional role of DMS serotonin in reward-related behavior. Overall our results demonstrate that serotonin can modulate the DMS in a behavioral state-specific manner, potentially providing a mechanism for how serotonin effects on behavior are context-dependent.",

      "title": "Exploring the functions of JAKMIP1 in neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and its relevance to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome",
      "content": "Growing evidence supports neuroinflammation as a risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a classical pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-related phenotypes. To better understand molecular factors that modify neuronal cytokine responses in ASD, we investigated potential roles for JAKMIP1, a gene linked to chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome (Dup15q; a form of syndromic ASD), in regulating IL-6/STAT3 signaling. We observe that JAKMIP1 deficiency impairs IL-6/STAT3 signaling and IL-6-induced neuritogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells; and discover that JAKMIP1 may regulate STAT3 expression via its C-terminus, which exhibits nucleoplasmic localization. Additionally, we find that IL-6/STAT3 signaling is altered in Dup15q hiPSCs-derived cortical neurons, which display heightened responsiveness to IL-6; though it is unclear whether and how JAKMIP1 contributes to this. Overall, our findings identify JAKMIP1 as a modulator of neuronal IL-6/STAT3 signaling and support that ASD-linked genetic variants can alter the inflammatory landscape of ASD.",

      "title": "Burst suppression: a default brain state associated with loss of network complexity",
      "content": "Burst suppression (BS) is a highly stereotyped EEG pattern observed across a wide range of clinical contexts, from general anesthesia and postanoxic coma to neonatal encephalopathy. Despite its consistent appearance, BS comprises two distinct forms with markedly different implications. BS with identical bursts (IBS) is almost exclusively seen in patients with severe, irreversible encephalopathy and is consistently associated with poor neurological outcome. In contrast, heterogeneous BS (HBS) can appear in reversible conditions such as anesthesia. The mechanisms that give rise to these divergent forms remain elusive. Existing theories impose disease-specific processes on otherwise healthy networks, but such models fail to explain why BS emerges across diverse etiologies and disregard the clinically critical distinction between IBS and HBS. We combined clinical, experimental, and computational approaches to identify shared mechanisms underlying BS. We analyzed EEG recordings from patients with a severe postanoxic encephalopathy and from patients undergoing general anesthesia. These clinical observations were compared with activity recordings from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal networks and rodent cortical cultures, and simulations of biophysically grounded neuronal network models. Purely excitatory, low-complexity networks, both in vitro and in silico, spontaneously generated activity virtually indistinguishable from pathological IBS. Introducing inhibitory neurons, modular network structure, or diverse external inputs progressively increased signal complexity and produced HBS-like or continuous activity resembling physiological EEG. Our findings suggest that BS, and particularly IBS, reflects a default dynamic state of simplified excitatory networks that emerges when biological complexity is lost. Different clinical conditions may compromise distinct mechanisms--inhibition, connectivity, or afferent input--yet converge on the same underlying activity pattern. While IBS reflects near-complete loss of complexity, HBS indicates partial preservation. This unified framework explains how diverse etiologies converge on BS and highlights identical forms as signatures of severely reduced network complexity.",

      "content": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 122, Issue 43, October 2025. <br />SignificanceFluent reading requires that the brain encodes the order of letters within a word, yet without regard for where they appear on the retina. Information must be transformed from a retinotopic code into a position-invariant word form. Here, we ...",

      "content": "Humans stand out in the animal kingdom for their ability to reason in highly abstract ways. Using a deep-data precision fMRI approach, we identify and richly characterize a network of frontal brain areas that support abstract formal reasoning. This 'abstract reasoning' network robustly dissociates from the domain-general Multiple Demand network--the current leading candidate substrate of fluid intelligence--as well as from three other networks supporting high-level cognition: the language network, the intuitive physical reasoning network, and the social reasoning network. Finally, the areas of this network respond robustly during both deductive and inductive reasoning, during classic matrix reasoning problems, and when solving multiplication and division problems. This network may therefore support the most abstract forms of reasoning, possibly constituting a human-specific adaptation.",
