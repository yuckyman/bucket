      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Effective and efficient self-supervised masked model based on mixed feature training",
      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

At first Python felt amazing I loved learning new concepts. But when topics like OOP and dictionaries came in, I suddenly felt like maybe I wasn\u2019t good enough. Still, I pushed through and finished the course. Later we shifted to a new place, far from the institute. My teacher there was great he even asked why I chose pharmacy over programming. I told him the truth: I tried for NEET, didn\u2019t clear it due to lack of interest and my own fault to avoid studies during that time, so I chose B.Pharm while doing Python on the side. He appreciated that. But now the problem is whenever college exams come, I have to stop coding. And every time I return, my concepts feel weak again, so I end up relearning things. This keeps repeating. Honestly, throughout my life, I\u2019ve never really started something purely out of interest or finished it properly except programming. Python is the only thing I genuinely enjoy, Now I\u2019m continuing programming as a hobby growing bit by bit and even getting better in my studies. But sometimes I still think if I should keep going or just let it go. I'm planning first to complete my course then focus completely on my dream.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ToKnowTheWorldBetter\"> /u/ToKnowTheWorldBetter </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p8155t/need_a_suggestion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p8155t/need_a_suggestion/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>We are happy to <a href=\"https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/blog/2025/11/24/hatch-v1160/\">announce</a> version 1.16.0 of Hatch. This release wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Cary, our new co-maintainer. He picked up my unfinished workspaces branch and made it production-ready, added SBOM support to Hatchling, and landed a bunch of PRs from contributors!</p> <p>My motivation took a big hit last year, in large part due to improper use of social media: I simply didn\u2019t realize that continued mass evangelism is required nowadays. This led to some of our novel features being attributed to other tools when in fact Hatch was months ahead. I\u2019m sorry to say that this greatly discouraged me and I let it affect maintenance. I tried to come back on several occasions but could only make incremental progress on the workspaces branch because I had to relearn the code each time. I\u2019ve been having to make all recent releases from a branch based on an old commit because there were many prerequisite changes that were merged and couldn\u2019t be released as is.</p> <p>No more of that! Development will be much more rapid now, even better than the way it used to be. We are very excited for upcoming features :-)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ofekmeister\"> /u/Ofekmeister </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p898zg/hatch_v1160_workspaces_dependency_groups_and_sboms/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p898zg/hatch_v1160_workspaces_dependency_groups_and_sboms/\">[comments]</a></span>",
