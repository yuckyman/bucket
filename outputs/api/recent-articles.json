Considering the deluge of trash they deal with every day, I think they are doing a valiant job and are to be commended. Consider it merely a place to discuss, which is what HN does best.<p>That said, it's becoming more and more obvious every day that there is a tremendous amount of attempts by bots, and specifically AI agents, to inject slop into HN threads. I worry about the integrity of the discourse here and if the ever growing wave of garbage will overtake staff resources to deal with it. Is it time to implement captcha for HN? If so, should it be out of the box, or a new mechanism more tailored to the security and privacy-centric nature of the HN readership? Are captchas even still effective enough in the age of AI to warrant their use?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46544969\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46544969</a></p>\n<p>Points: 15</p>\n<p># Comments: 10</p>",

      "content": "Exercise provides a range of benefits for physical and mental health. It relieves stress, yet paradoxically, it recruits the bodys stress response system. Here we show that activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone cells of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRHPVN) and the endocrine arm of the stress axis is necessary, but not sufficient for the beneficial effects of exercise. Specifically, glucocorticoids act synergistically with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on CRHPVN cells during exercise to reverse behavioral and synaptic sensitization after stress. In the absence of exercise, optogenetic activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor after stress is sufficient to reverse behavioral sensitization and synaptic metaplasticity. Our findings reveal a novel, time-sensitive mechanism by which exercise alleviates the impact of acute stress.",

      "title": "CNN-based framework for Alzheimer's disease detection from EEG via dynamic mode decomposition",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Global context rapidly shapes sensory responses in V1",
      "content": "Context modulates sensory processing in the cerebral cortex by suppressing responses to expected stimuli and enhancing responses to unexpected ones. Recent proposals argue that early sensory areas such as primary visual cortex (V1) are shaped only by local context, including recent stimulus history, whereas modulation by global context, such as learned temporal structure, is present exclusively in higher cortical areas. This view is incompatible with predictive coding theories. To directly dissociate local and global contextual influences, we used a global/local oddball paradigm in which mice viewed five-item sequences. Across conditions, sequence structure was held constant while stimulus identity and predictability were selectively manipulated, allowing the isolation of response modulations due to local deviance, global expectation, and stimulus repetition independently. In the canonical sequence (AAAA-B), B is locally deviant but globally predictable. Using two-photon calcium imaging and LFP recordings in mouse V1, we found that global predictability abolished context modulation: responses to B were equivalent to those evoked by a random sequence control (e.g., CDEAB). This effect emerged rapidly, after only <10 sequence repetitions, demonstrating fast learning of global structure. When the stimulus was globally deviant, either by replacing B with a novel stimulus (AAAA-C) or by presenting B unpredictably in a standard oddball paradigm, V1 exhibited robust response enhancement. These effects required feedback from anterior cingulate area (ACa), establishing a causal role for higher cortical circuits in conveying global predictions to V1. Strikingly, when an additional A replaced B (AAAA-A), responses were strongly suppressed despite global deviance, indicating that stimulus-specific adaptation may constrain the expression of global prediction error signals in early sensory cortex.",

      "title": "Acute, low-grade inflammation elevates white matter sensitivity to ischemia",
      "content": "Ischemic brain injuries, including stroke, are highly prevalent neurological diseases. Acute, low-grade inflammation, often resulting from peripheral infection, is a recognised risk factor. White matter axons, and their supporting glia, are susceptible to both ischemic and neuroinflammatory injury. The mechanisms behind ischemic and severe inflammatory injury in white matter are well established. However, the white matter response to acute, low-grade inflammation, and how this can interact with co-morbidities such as cerebral ischemia are yet to be examined. Here, we examine the response of white matter to acute, low-grade inflammation and the downstream effects this had on sensitivity of ischemia. Ex vivo mouse optic nerve and corpus callosum, central white matter tracts, tolerated acute, low-grade inflammation (110-minutes, 0.1ug/ml LPS), with preserved action potential conduction, limited microglial activation and no axo-myelinic damage. Exposure to these conditions elevated indicators of stress in oligodendrocytes which, when exposed to ischemic conditions (30 minutes oxygen-glucose deprivation), impaired their ability to maintain healthy myelin. There was a resulting increase in axo-myelinic damage and functional decline associated with ischemic conditions compared to white matter that had not been pre-exposed to LPS. Microglial depletion or dampening microglial responses with the clinically available drug minocycline eliminated the elevated sensitivity of white matter to ischemic injury associated with acute, low-grade inflammation. We demonstrate that acute, low-grade neuroinflammation primes white matter for heightened vulnerability to ischemic injury through microglial-mediated mechanisms. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of ischemic brain injury observed during systemic inflammatory states and highlights microglial modulation as a clinical strategy to mitigate ischemic damage in susceptible patients.",

      "title": "Modeling how contextual and structural biases shape duration perception",
      "content": "Human time perception is flexible and shaped by both structural constraints and contextual influences. Disentangling these sources of bias is essential for understanding the predictive mechanisms underlying temporal perception, yet no unified model currently integrates them. Here, we quantified precisely the structural and contextual biases in a duration discrimination task to constrain models of duration perception. Using a duration discrimination task, healthy participants judged which of two consecutive stimuli lasted longer. Stimuli were visual, auditory, or cross-modal. Consistent with previous findings, auditory stimuli were perceived as longer than visual stimuli of equal duration, reflecting intrinsic properties of audiovisual neural processing. Contextual biases were manipulated through different duration distributions known to influence temporal judgments. Our results show that duration discrimination relies on distinct representations of each stimulus distribution and is best explained by a combination of Bayesian inference and rescaling. While Bayesian inference accounts for contextual effects such as regression to the mean, rescaling mechanisms predict opposite effects by correcting perceived durations after repeated exposure. These findings challenge existing accounts of contextual effects in time perception and suggest that the brain normalizes temporal representations to adapt to environmental statistics.",
