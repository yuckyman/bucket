      "title": "Protectin DX resolves fracture-induced postoperative pain in mice via neuronal signaling and GPR37-activated macrophage efferocytosis",
      "content": "Protectin DX (PDX) is a member of the superfamily of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and exerts anti-inflammatory actions in animal models; but the specific signaling pathways involved in its actions have not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate the analgesic actions of PDX in a mouse model of tibial fracture-induced postoperative pain (fPOP) via activation of GPR37. Intravenous early-phase and late-phase treatment of PDX (100 ng/mouse) effectively alleviated fPOP. Compared to protectin D1/neuroprotectin D1, DHA, steroid, and meloxicam, PDX produced superior pain relief. While dexamethasone and meloxicam prolonged fPOP, PDX shortened the pain duration. The analgesic effects of PDX were abrogated in Gpr37 knockout mice, which displayed deficits in fPOP resolution. PDX binds GPR37 and induces calcium responses in peritoneal macrophages. LC-MS-MS-based lipidomic analysis revealed that endogenous PDX levels were ~10-fold higher than PD1 in muscle at the fracture site. PDX promotes macrophage polarization via GPR37-dependent phagocytosis and efferocytosis through calcium signaling in vitro, and it further enhances macrophage viability and efferocytosis in vivo via GPR37. Finally, PDX rapidly modulates nociceptor neuron responses by suppressing C-fiber-induced muscle reflex in vivo and calcium responses in DRG neurons ex vivo and reducing TRPA1/TRPV1-induced acute pain and neurogenic inflammation in vivo. Our findings highlight multiple benefits of PDX to manage postoperative pain and promote perioperative recovery.",

      "title": "Reversible synaptic deficits in early-stage Batten disease",
      "content": "Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL, Batten Disease) is a childhood-onset, neurodegenerative, lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal gene CLN3. Progressive cognitive decline is a key clinical manifestation of JNCL, and no definitive treatment is currently available. The precise function of CLN3 in neurons remains unclear, hindering the development of targeted therapies. Using patch-clamp and AAV-mediated re-expression of CLN3 in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice, we demonstrate that CLN3 is essential for synaptic function. Loss of CLN3 caused defective synaptic vesicle release and reduced synaptic strength reflecting impairments in both pre- and postsynaptic function in Cln3{Delta}ex7/8 mice before the occurrence of neurodegeneration. Moreover, we observed reduced network bursting and deficits in intrinsic neuronal excitability, indicating early functional disturbances independent of storage burden and neuronal death in CLN3-deficient mice. To assess whether CLN3 is required for proper pre- and postsynaptic function, we re-expressed CLN3 selectively in pre- and postsynaptic neurons. We found non-redundant requirements at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to sustain function. Importantly, AAV9-mediated gene rescue at early-disease stages corrected preexisting synaptic defects and restored function. Together, these findings demonstrate the requirement of CLN3 in maintaining synaptic function and show that the therapeutic window may extend to stages characterized by early functional deficits, highlighting the potential of targeted gene therapy to restore function and improve cognitive outcomes.",

      "title": "Wake consolidates event memory, sleep binds it with context",
      "content": "Sleep is thought to be superior to wakefulness in consolidating memory, due to a hippocampus-driven process enhancing the contextual integration of events. We compared recall of associative memory in different contexts, and found that memory is also consolidated during wakefulness, although in a qualitatively distinct way. Healthy participants performed a cued stimulus-response (S-R) learning task requiring speeded object classification. Learning was followed by 2 hours of sleep or wakefulness. Reaction times revealed stronger S-R memory after sleep than wakefulness with retrieval in the same context, and this benefit was linked to increased sleep spindle activity. In contrast, S-R memory was stronger after wakefulness than sleep when tested in a different context. This wake-dependent enhancement had a fast onset and was reversed by delayed sleep. We conclude that, unlike sleep strengthening the binding of an event with its context, wakefulness stabilizes event representations itself, i.e., not bound to a specific context.",

      "title": "A method for the time-frequency analysis of high-order interactions in non-stationary physiological networks",
      "content": "Objective. Several data-driven approaches based on information theory have been proposed for analyzing high-order interactions (HOIs) involving three or more components of a network system. The existing methods do not account for temporal correlations in the data, or are defined only in the time domain and rely on the assumption of stationarity in the underlying dynamics, making them inherently unable to detect frequency-specific behaviors and track transient functional links in physiological networks. Approach. This study introduces a new framework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs in networks of random processes through the spectral representation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and frequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a recursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Main results. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyzes. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. The application to cardiovascular oscillations reveals a reduction in redundant information following head-up tilt, reflecting a functional disconnection within the physiological network of heart period, respiratory, and arterial pressure signals. Significance. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and time-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks. As our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the study of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in many network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other fields.",

      "title": "PIAS1/PIAS4-Mediated SUMOylation of TDP-43 is Induced by Oxidative Stress",
      "content": "TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a conserved RNA and DNA binding protein that functions in transcriptional repression, pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA stabilization. Under pathological conditions found in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, TDP-43 shows aberrant mislocalization from the nucleus and cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation. TDP-43 also appears to play a role in DNA damage repair, specifically in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), suggesting that nuclear depletion of TDP-43 may contribute towards the accumulation of DNA damage observed in TDP-43 proteinopathies. These TDP-43 pathological inclusions are decorated with post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation. SUMOylation (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) is a dynamic post-translational modification that regulates many protein properties and is implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathology. DNA damage repair proteins are commonly regulated through SUMOylation, and the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4 are required for efficient DNA repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Given these findings, we investigated TDP-43 SUMOylation and whether SUMO modification impacts TDP-43s DNA damage repair function. We show that TDP-43 can be modified by SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 and confirm SUMOylation in response to oxidative stress. We also determine which regions of TDP-43 are SUMOylated and show that this modification is facilitated by the SUMO E3 ligases PIAS1 and PIAS4. Etoposide-induced DNA damage did not promote SUMOylation of TDP-43; studies are ongoing to determine the impact of TDP-43 SUMOylation on DNA repair.",

      "title": "Show HN: Cancer diagnosis makes for an interesting RL environment for LLMs",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN, this is David from Aluna (YC S24). We work with diagnostic labs to build datasets and evals for oncology tasks.<p>I wanted to share a simple RL environment I built that gave frontier LLMs a set of tools that lets it zoom and pan across a digitized pathology slide to find the relevant regions to make a diagnosis. \nHere are some videos of the LLM performing diagnosis on a few slides:<p>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ixTWswT5c\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7ixTWswT5c</a>): traces of an LLM choosing different regions to view before making a diagnosis on a case of small-cell carcinoma of the lung<p>(<a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=0cMbqLnKkGU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtube.com/watch?v=0cMbqLnKkGU</a>): traces of an LLM choosing different regions to view before making a diagnosis on a case of benign fibroadenoma of the breast<p>Why I built this:<p>Pathology slides are the backbone of modern cancer diagnosis. Tissue from a biopsy is sliced, stained, and mounted on glass for a pathologist to examine abnormalities.<p>Today, many of these slides are digitized into whole-slide images (WSIs)in TIF or SVS format and are several gigabytes in size.<p>While there exists several pathology-focused AI models, I was curious to test whether frontier LLMs can perform well on pathology-based tasks. The main challenge is that WSIs are too large to fit into an LLM\u2019s context window. The standard workaround, splitting them into thousands of smaller tiles, is inefficient for large frontier LLMs.<p>Inspired by how pathologists zoom and pan under a microscope, I built a set of tools that let LLMs control magnification and coordinates, viewing small regions at a time and deciding where to look next.<p>This ended up resulting in some interesting behaviors, and actually seemed to yield pretty good results with prompt engineering:<p>- GPT 5: explored up to ~30 regions before deciding (concurred with an expert pathologist on 4 out of 6 cancer subtyping tasks and 3 out of 5 IHC scoring tasks)<p>- Claude 4.5: Typically used 10\u201315 views but similar accuracy as GPT-5 (concurred with the pathologist on 3 out of 6 cancer subtyping tasks and 4 out of 5 IHC scoring tasks)<p>- Smaller models (GPT 4o, Claude 3.5 Haiku): examined ~8 frames and were less accurate overall (1 out of 6 cancer subtytping tasks and 1 out of 5 IHC scoring tasks)<p>Obviously, this was a small sample set, so we are working on creating a larger benchmark suite with more cases and types of tasks, but I thought this was cool that it even worked so I wanted to share with HN!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45902590\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45902590</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Launch HN: JSX Tool (YC F25) \u2013 A Browser Dev-Panel IDE for React",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN, We\u2019re Jamie & Dan, building JSX Tool (<a href=\"https://jsxtool.com\">https://jsxtool.com</a>) a new inspector/dev panel IDE that allows you to navigate to any line of your React project\u2019s JSX with just a click and a command click to explore your render stack.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIIXvN7vhrs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIIXvN7vhrs</a><p>I\u2019ve been writing React code for nearly a decade. Since I first saw source maps in the days of Babel and Redux, I\u2019ve always wanted to be able to edit my code from the source maps. I\u2019ve also always wanted to be able to inspect my JSX like it was HTML.<p>Last year, I found my first real use of AI was taking ad-hoc CSS changes in the Chrome element inspector, pasting them into ChatGPT, and asking for the equivalent in Tailwind. I\u2019d then paste those changes into my React TSX files.<p>I wanted to streamline this process but came to the conclusion that to do so I needed to build a JSX inspector. I had to write a custom AST parser to create a mapping between the JSX and HTML. So I hacked on an inspector for a couple of months that connected JSX to the DOM in both directions.<p>The next feature was adding a CSS editor, like the one in the browser inspectors but for JSX. Unlike styling a piece of HTML I decided that any in memory style edits to a React fiber should be globally applied, as if you had tweaked that line of code in your codebase.<p>Finally, I was able to add the two AI features I really wanted: (1) prompt for in-memory styles for when I was pixel tweaking, and (2) save those temporary changes back to my codebase in the convention of the codebase I was working in.<p>To accomplish talking to the filesystem from the Chrome extension I built a little local server that mounts from the root of your project and allows the extension to send file-system commands back to your project root. We named this the \u201cDev Server\u201d. (Note: You can fully use us as a JSX inspector without this server installed.)<p>After all that, I found that to convert myself as a user I needed it to be a pretty fully functional IDE. I needed vim bindings, I needed a typechecker, I needed auto-complete, I needed a linter, I needed code search and I needed a proper file explorer. Fortunately we were able to take advantage of the dev-server architecture we had stumbled onto in order to add an LSP server and Rip Grep. At this point, after months of dog fooding, I use JSX Tool for almost all of my website edits.<p>We\u2019re still rough around the edges for mobile but we\u2019re working on that.<p>All of the IDE stuff not involving AI is free and works fine without AI. We let you get a taste of the prompting stuff for free but apply some rate limits.<p>The extension itself is not open source but the dev server with the LSP is. It\u2019s a great foundation if you want to build any sort of in-browser IDE and it's nearly React agnostic. Building the dev server was a big undertaking so I\u2019d love to see someone fork it and find value in it.<p>In the future we want to start adding things that we are in a position to take advantage of over something like Cursor, such as letting AI give you code suggestions for runtime exceptions or work with the network logs. We think that the convenience of having your IDE in the dev panel gives us a leg up in convenience and workflow context.<p>Anyway, regardless of how you feel about AI coding, I wanted to make something that was useful with or without AI. We\u2019d love it if you gave it a spin and we want to share anything we can about the technical side of the product that you might find interesting.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903161\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45903161</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",
