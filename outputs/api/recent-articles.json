      "content": "<p>Most consensus libraries (Raft, Paxos) treat the state machine as a pure black box. This is fine until your state machine needs to actually do something, like charge a credit card, fire a webhook, or send an email.<p>If a leader crashes after the side effect but before committing it, you get duplicates. This is my attempt at fixing this problem from first principles ish: build chr2 to make crash-safe side effects first-class citizens.<p>mechanism:<p>Replicated Outbox: Side effects are stored as \"pending\" in replicated state. Only the leader executes them under a fencing token.<p>Durable Fencing: A manifest persists the highest view using atomic tmp+fsync+rename. This ensures a \"zombie\" leader can't wake up and double-execute stale effects.<p>Deterministic Context: Application code receives a deterministic RNG seed and block_time from the log, ensuring 1:1 state transitions during replay.<p>Strict WAL: Entries are CRC\u2019d and hash chained. it is designed to prefer halting on mid-log corruption over guessing.<p>The Trade-offs: Side effects are intentionally at-least-once; \"exactly-once\" requires stable effect IDs for sink-side deduplication.

      "content": "<p>There are 8.2 billion humans on earth.</p>\n<p>We're extremely dynamic. You will meet people all through your life with different personalities, skills, and interests. This individual uniqueness not only makes life more interesting, but it also increases our collective ability to handle a wide range of ideas and problems.</p>\n<p>Despite these capabilities, our differences can also lead to an overwhelming feeling of division in some. Differences often lead to disagreement, anger, hostility, or violence. To say humans don't often inflict cruelty on one another would be a lie. We absolutely have shown our teeth. In innumerable ways, we've caused horror to our own species. We've dehumanized, caused suffering, and in many cases killed one another.</p>\n<p>In many ways, we're still learning. Humanity is still growing. A lot of people are trying to sort right from wrong, fair from unfair, true from untrue. This leads to a lot of confusion, a lot of chaos, and a lot of violence. To see humans go after other humans in such efficient and relentless manners is terrifying and beyond disheartening. It can be easy to lose hope, but the truth is... <em>none of it is necessary.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>None of the violence, none of the hate, none of the inequality is mandatory.</strong></em></p>\n<p>We are allowed to go against the grain of things we know are wrong. <em>We are allowed to improve our world.</em> Never be scared to do what you know is right, even when its hard, even when it might benefit someone else more than yourself. Match relentless selfishness with your own relentless generosity. Resist chaos and confusion with serenity and understanding. Engulf violence with endless harmony.</p>\n<p>Remember that truth doesn't rely on anyone. Truth doesn't ask for our opinions. Truth is eternal, unwavering, and it will always be there, waiting for us to realize what we're capable of together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em><strong>In this world there\u2019s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</strong></em> Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. <em><strong>More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.</strong></em>&quot; - Charlie Chaplin</li>\n</ul>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>This project demonstrates that <strong>Pygame is capable of true 3D rendering</strong> when used as a low-level rendering surface rather than a full engine.<br /> It implements a <strong>custom software 3D pipeline</strong> (manual perspective projection, camera transforms, occlusion, collision, and procedural world generation) entirely in Python, using Pygame only for windowing, input, and pixel output.</p> <p>The goal is not to compete with modern engines, but to show that <strong>3D space can be constructed directly from math</strong>without relying on prebuilt 3D frameworks, shaders, or hardware acceleration.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>This project is <strong>not intended for production use</strong> or as a general-purpose game engine.</p> <p>It is aimed at:</p> <ul> <li>programmers interested in <strong>graphics fundamentals</strong></li> <li>developers curious about <strong>software-rendered 3D</strong></li> <li>people exploring <strong>procedural environments and liminal space design</strong></li> <li>learners who want to understand how 3D works <em>under the hood</em>, without abstraction layers</li> </ul> <p>It functions as an <strong>experimental / exploratory project</strong>, closer to a technical proof or art piece than a traditional game.</p> <h1>Comparison to Existing Alternatives</h1> <p>Unlike engines such as <strong>Unity, Unreal, or Godot</strong>, this project:</p> <ul> <li>does not use a scene graph or mesh system</li> <li>does not rely on GPU pipelines or shaders</li> <li>does not hide complexity behind engine abstractions</li> <li>does not include physics, lighting, or asset pipelines by default</li> </ul> <p>Compared to most \u201cfake 3D\u201d Pygame demos, it differs in that:</p> <ul> <li>depth, perspective, and occlusion are computed mathematically</li> <li>space persists independently of the camera</li> <li>world geometry exists whether it is visible or not</li> <li>interaction (movement, destruction) affects a continuous 3D environment rather than pre-baked scenes</li> </ul> <p>The result is a <strong>raw, minimal, software-defined 3D space</strong> that emphasizes structure, scale, and persistence over visual polish.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/colortheory42/THE_BACKROOMS.git\">https://github.com/colortheory42/THE_BACKROOMS.git</a></p> <p>download and terminal and type:</p> <p>just run this in your directory in your terminal:</p> <p>cd ~/Downloads/THE_BACKROOMS-main</p> <p>pip3 install pygame</p> <p>python3 <a href=\"http://main.py\">main.py</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ConjecturesOfAGeek\"> /u/ConjecturesOfAGeek </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q9n723/pygame_is_capable_of_true_3d_rendering/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q9n723/pygame_is_capable_of_true_3d_rendering/\">[comments]</a></span>",
