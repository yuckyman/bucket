      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>In our laboratory we have this automation projects encompassing a 2 syringe pumps, 4 rotary valves and a chiller. The idea is that it will do some chemical synthesis and be in operation roughly 70-80% of the time (apart from the chiller, the other equipment will not actually do things most of the time, as they wait for reactions to happen). It would run a pre-determined program set by the user which lasts anything from 2-72 hours, during which it would pump reagents to different places, change temperature etc. I have seen equipment like this run of LabView/similar, PLC but not so many on Python. </p> <p>Could python be a reliable approach to control this? It would save us so much money and time (easier programming than PLC).</p> <p>Note: All these parts have RS232/RS485 ports and some already have python driver in GitHub.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/deduhej_\"> /u/deduhej_ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qrguk2/is_it_reliable_to_run_lab_equipment_on_python/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qrguk2/is_it_reliable_to_run_lab_equipment_on_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I use co-pilot fairly regularly, and simple behaviors like scrolling up/down copying/pasting text from previous dialogues etc. are painful/difficult and the feature generally feels half finished or just broken/scattered. I will log on from one day to another and the models that are available will switch around randomly (I had access to Opus 4.5 and then suddenly didn't the next day, regained access the day after).

      "title": "Rethinking the role of position in cortical function",
      "content": "<p>Nature Neuroscience, Published online: 08 January 2026; <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02191-y\">doi:10.1038/s41593-025-02191-y</a></p>Abnormally located cortical neurons, displaced in developing mice lacking cortical Eml1, retain their molecular identities, form appropriate connections and build functional sensory maps. Most strikingly, these misplaced neurons can drive behavior by themselves \u2014 showing that brain function depends on how neurons connect, and to what, more than where they live.",
