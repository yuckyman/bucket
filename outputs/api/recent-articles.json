      "content": "Immunomechanobiology, the study of how physical forces influence the behavior and function of immune cells, is a rapidly growing area of research. It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Oligodendrocytes support functional development of subcortical premotor neurons and navigation",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce are required for proper balance behaviors in adult vertebrates. If, when, and how they shape the functional development of vestibular (balance) circuits and associated behaviors is unclear. We first adopted a pharmacological approach to investigate the contribution of oligodendrocytes across early development of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Disruption of oligodendrogenesis reduces the number of oligodendrocytes near vestibular neurons across development, but only impacts vertical navigation -- a behavior requiring vestibular function -- in older larvae. Correspondingly, we found that midbrain premotor neurons in the vertical navigation circuit only decreased their responses to tilts at later ages. In contrast, we found that the vestibulo-ocular reflex was unaffected by drug treatment, and that body-tilt responses in the underlying hindbrain vestibular neurons and their target extraocular motor neurons were unchanged. Targeted photoablation of oligodendrocytes in the anterior hindbrain replicated our pharmacological findings, selectively disrupting vertical navigation in older animals. By dissociating where and when developmentally-disrupted oligodendrogenesis impacts neuronal function and behavior, our work takes a major step towards understanding how oligodendrocytes enable the maturation of sensorimotor behaviors.",

      "title": "Rapid generation of ventral A9-like dopaminergic neurons from patterned iPSCs",
      "content": "In vitro modelling of highly vulnerable nigral dopaminergic (DA) neuronal subtypes in Parkinson's disease (PD), is necessary for studying disease mechanisms. Here, we optimized a new approach by expressing the pioneer neurogenic transcription factor, Achaete-scute-like 1 (Ascl1), implicated in determining dopaminergic fate. Sequential small-molecule patterning of iPSCs into early floor plate mesencephalic progenitors, followed by inducible Ascl1 expression, rapidly differentiates midbrain DA neurons. Immunocytochemistry and transcriptomic analysis of these patterned Ascl1-driven DA neurons (PA-DANs) confirmed midbrain-lineage specificity. Importantly, we found an enrichment of DA subpopulations that corresponded to the adult human ventral SOX6-positive A9 DA subtypes vulnerable in PD. Furthermore, we combined these ventral A9-like PA-DANs with human iPSC-derived midbrain astrocytes and microglia in defined ratios to generate mature 3D A9-like assembled organoids that display characteristic spontaneous neuronal activity and electrical propagation along the axon. Our method efficiently generates a mature and functional A9-like DA neuronal platform to study PD.",

      "title": "Senescent astrocytic deposits drive cognitive decline by disrupting tripartite synapse in the aging brain",
      "content": "Brain aging involves synapse decline, with astrocytes playing a key role in synapse homeostasis. However, the impact of astrocyte senescence on synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline remains unclear. Here, we identified a hallmark of aging astrocytes Senescent Astrocytic Deposits (SAD) observed at aged rodents, macaques, and human hippocampal astrocytic processes that is associated with tripartite synapse dysfunction and memory decline. Laser capture microdissection-coupled mass spectrometry (LCM-MS), spatial transcriptome analysis and 3D electron microscopy revealed that SAD are abnormal protein deposits at the processes of ApoE-high expression astrocyte subtype and associated with dysfunctional tripartite synapses. Using a transgenic mouse (Nrbf2 knockout) with accelerated SAD formation as a tool for genetic manipulation, we clearly demonstrated that age-dependent defect of phagocytosis at maturation stage in astrocytic drives SAD accumulation, synaptic injury and cognitive deficits. Collectively, our findings establish SAD as a mechanistic link between astrocyte senescence and synaptic damage, underscoring the critical role of astrocytic phagocytic function in preserving synaptic homeostasis and cognitive function during aging.",

      "title": "Deletion of Cacna1c (CaV1.2) in D1-expressing cells elicits divergent sex-specific effects on aversive and spatial memories",
      "content": "Dopamine signaling is critical for cognitive and emotional regulation and is implicated in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. One downstream effector of dopamine is the L-type calcium channel CaV1.2, encoded by the risk gene CACNA1C. Genome-wide association studies have consistently linked CACNA1C single nucleotide polymorphisms to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related conditions. We previously showed that homozygous deletion of Cacna1c in dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-expressing cells enhances remote (30 days post-training) contextual fear memory in male mice. Here, we extend these findings by examining sex- and gene dosage-specific behavioral consequences of Cacna1c loss in D1 cells. We find that D1-Cacna1c deletion produces a sex- and gene dosage-dependent effect on fear memory. In males, homozygous loss of D1-Cacna1c heightens remote contextual fear at 30-days post-training, replicating prior findings, whereas partial loss had no effect. Cue-associated fear memory remained unaffected across genotypes. In contrast, females exhibited heightened contextual fear with both heterozygous and homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss at 24-hrs, 7-days, and 30-days post-training, indicating increased sensitivity to contextual aversive learning. Cue-associated fear memory was higher at 24-hrs but normalized at later time points in females. In the Water Y-maze, males with heterozygous or homozygous D1-Cacna1c loss showed impaired spatial memory at 7-days post-training, whereas females were unaffected. D1-Cacna1c deletion reduced locomotor activity selectively in females during the initial 5-mins of a 60-min session, with no genotype effects in males. Social interaction and anxiety-like behavior were unchanged across groups. Together, these findings highlight the interplay between dopamine receptor signaling and calcium channel function in shaping sex-dependent aspects of memory.",

      "title": "Tuned to explore: Increased phasic responses to auditory targets and novelty in children regardless of induced tonic arousal",
      "content": "The ability to focus on relevant information while ignoring distractions is critical during childhood, as it supports learning, social interaction, and adaptation to changing environments. This attentional balance is thought to depend in part on arousal regulation, mediated by the activity of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Moderate levels of arousal are typically associated with optimal cognitive performance. However, the interaction between arousal and attention remains poorly understood in humans, especially during development. In this study, we investigated whether experimentally modulating tonic arousal, the baseline level of physiological alertness, affects attentional processing in children (N = 44, aged 6-8) and adults (N = 46, aged 18-35). Participants performed an active auditory three-stimulus (standard, novel, target) oddball task, designed to assess selective attention to target tones and distraction by novel sounds. Prior to each task block, tonic arousal was manipulated using music or videos varying in arousing content. Physiological responses were recorded continuously (skin conductance, pupil dilation, heart rate) to index both tonic arousal and transient, phasic changes in arousal triggered by task events. While tonic arousal modulation was successful, as confirmed by skin conductance levels, Bayesian analyses provided evidence for no effect of this modulation on subsequent attentional processing. Importantly, children generally exhibited stronger phasic arousal responses, particularly to task-irrelevant novel sounds, reflecting less mature regulation of attention and arousal. These findings show developmental differences in physiological responses to unexpected environmental stimuli and provide physiological evidence of increased distractibility during childhood.",

      "title": "KIF5A binds RNA to orchestrate synaptic mRNA localization and stress granules in ALS",
      "content": "Neuronal health depends on the precise transport and local translation of mRNAs to maintain synaptic function across highly polarized cellular architecture. While kinesin motor proteins are known to mediate mRNA transport, the specificity and direct involvement of individual kinesins as RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that KIF5A, a neuron-specific kinesin implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), functions as an RBP. We show that KIF5A directly binds mRNAs encoding synaptic ribosomal proteins and is required for their synaptic localization and for maintaining normal synaptic composition and function. Additionally, we show ALS-linked KIF5A mutations confer gain-of-function properties, enhancing mRNA binding, increasing synaptic ribosomal protein accumulation, inducing neuronal hyperexcitability, and impairing stress responses. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mutant KIF5A disrupts synaptic homeostasis. Our work positions a kinesin motor protein as an RBP with critical roles in mRNA transport, local translation, and stress response.",

      "title": "Striatal Pathways for Action Counting and Steering",
      "content": "The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for coordinating voluntary movements, yet their precise contribution remains a subject of debate. Using a novel operant counting task, we trained mice to perform a specific number of lever presses to obtain a reward, enabling quantification of continuous kinematics, discrete actions, and action sequences. Optogenetic manipulations of direct pathway (dSPN) and indirect pathway (iSPN) striatal projection neurons exert bidirectional and dissociable influences on both movement steering and action count progression: activation of dSPNs extends press sequences as if resetting an internal accumulator, whereas activation of iSPNs prematurely terminates them, mimicking completion of the count. In vivo calcium imaging reveals distinct yet intermixed populations of dSPNs and iSPNs representing either lever approach or count progression, with ramping activity patterns consistent with accumulation and discharge dynamics. Importantly, the difference between dSPN and iSPN population activity scales with proximity to both spatial and count-based goals, unifying discrete and continuous control within a push/pull model. These findings establish the BG as a central circuit for integrating kinematic and sequential representations to monitor and steer progress toward behavioral goals.",

      "title": "Modelling Predictive Coding in the Primary Visual Cortex (V1): Layer 2/3 Circuits for Prediction Error Computation through Compartmentalized Spiking Neurons",
      "content": "Cortical Layer 2/3 has been consistently implicated as the locus of prediction-error signalling in hierarchical models of cortical sensory processing. However, the circuit mechanisms that generate biologically plausible prediction-error (PE) signals remain elusive. A spiking network model is presented here in which two-compartment excitatory pyramidal neurons interact with three inhibitory subtypes: parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (SOM), and vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons,to compute sign-specific prediction errors (positive and negative PEs). Feedforward input targets the soma, whereas top-down feedback reaches the distal apical dendrite, enabling a local somato-dendritic comparison. A PE emerges whenever the balance between excitation and inhibition is selectively disrupted within one compartment, recruiting either positive-error (PE+) or negative-error (PE-) subpopulations of pyramidal neurons. Unlike prior learning-dependent, rate-based accounts, this fixed-weight spiking circuit shows that bidirectional PE signals (PE+ and PE) can arise online from compartment-specific balance without any synaptic weight updates. The model reproduces key experimental observations, including sparse mismatch responses, compartment-specific inhibition, and VIP-mediated disinhibition. Across four canonical sensory-prediction configurations, the circuit maintains a tight balance during matched input and generates bidirectional PE signals only under mismatch. By routing sensory drive from Layer 4 into Layer 2/3 and allowing the resulting PE activity to project toward deeper feedback generators, the model situates Layer 2/3 as a dedicated, feature-specific mismatch detector within a hierarchical inference network. These results provide a mechanistic bridge from dendritic computation to laminar predictive coding, demonstrating how realistic spiking dynamics can implement fast, sign-specific PE signaling without learning.",

      "title": "Structural changes in autism reflect atypical brain network organization and phenotypical heterogeneity: a hybrid deep network approach",
      "content": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by heterogeneity in social and emotional responses, language, and behavior. Assessments such as the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) can quantify this variability but understanding underlying mechanisms and identifying distinct and shared atypical organization and function of brain networks remains a challenge. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to analyze imaging data. However, the relationship between structural brain changes observed in structural MRI (sMRI), the affected brain functional networks inferred from these structural changes, and their connection to ASD phenotypes and scores still requires systematic investigation. In this study, we ensembled 3D CNNs with other artificial intelligence (AI) methods to conduct a comprehensive analysis of macrostructural changes in ASD. We found consistently dominant involvement of (a) the left hemisphere, (b) the frontal and temporal lobe, and (c) the default mode, salience, and language networks in ASD. Our findings highlighted brain network similarities and differences between high and low severity ASD and showed that typically developed brains fall at the low-severity end of the high-to-low severity spectrum of ASD. Our systematic AI approach utilized the phenotypic heterogeneity and spectral nature of ASD to uncover significant structural changes across brain regions and functional networks, correlating the structural, functional, and phenotypical heterogeneity of individuals with ASD. This enabled us to identify known and novel global and local brain region and network changes in ASD in relation to phenotypes and clinical scores that can guide diagnostic subtyping.",
