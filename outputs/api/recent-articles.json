      "title": "The intersection of near-death experiences (NDEs) and traumatic brain injury (TBI): neurobiological, phenomenological, and creative implications",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and near-death experiences (NDEs) represent profound disruptions in brain function, often associated with dramatic changes in consciousness, self-perception, and behavior. While these events are typically studied for their pathological consequences, a growing body of evidence suggests they may also trigger unexpected cognitive and creative enhancements in a subset of individuals. We explore the intersection between TBI, NDEs, and the emergence of heightened artistic expression, integrating findings from neuroanatomy, neuropathology, genetics, and phenomenology. We examine how alterations in key brain networks - such as the default mode network, frontoparietal circuits, and limbic regions - may underpin shifts in self-awareness, emotion processing, and symbolic thinking, which are frequently reported after NDEs or severe brain trauma. Additionally, we discuss the potential role of neuroplasticity, diaschisis, and compensatory reorganization in facilitating novel patterns of cognition and creative output following injury. Genetic factors potentially influencing susceptibility to such transformations are considered, alongside evolutionary perspectives on why these rare post-injury enhancements may occur. By synthesizing clinical cases, neuroscientific studies, and first-person accounts, we argue that certain brain injuries and altered states of consciousness can function as catalysts for reconfiguration of cognitive and emotional systems, leading to emergent artistic abilities or intensified creative insight. These phenomena challenge traditional dichotomies between damage and function, pathology and creativity, and invite new frameworks for understanding the plastic potential of the human brain. This overview-hypothesis driven article aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how the mind and brain interact under extreme conditions and how these interactions may unlock hidden reservoirs of human potential. The paper highlights the need for systematic research into post-traumatic and NDE-related cognitive changes, not only to improve clinical outcomes but also to broaden our knowledge of human consciousness and creativity.",

      "title": "Structural brain changes in subacute spinal cord injury: an analysis of diffusion kurtosis imaging and diffusion tensor imaging metrics with clinical correlation",
      "content": "IntroductionDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) can quantify indices related to brain structure and their change in pathology. However, only few studies have applied these techniques to spinal cord injury (SCI), and subtle microstructural changes in the brain of SCI individuals are not well understood. Our goal was to investigate structural changes in the brain using DTI (fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) and DKI parameters (kurtosis anisotropy, KA; mean kurtosis, MK) in subacute SCI and to study whether these changes were associated with clinical outcomes.MethodsTwenty-eight individuals with SCI underwent brain MRI 3\u202fmonths post-injury, alongside 20 healthy controls. Imaging included a multi-shell diffusion protocol, from which DTI and DKI metrics (FA, MD, KA and MK) were derived. Group comparisons were conducted for each metric across 17 brain regions selected based on their relevance to SCI from previous studies. Multiple comparison corrections were applied per metric to account for the number of examined regions. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen\u2019s d. For regions showing significant group differences, Spearman correlations were performed to assess associations between imaging metrics and clinical outcomes, including neurological status (ISNCSCI) and functional independence (SCIM III), with correction for multiple comparisons.ResultsMD was significantly higher in the right genu of the corpus callosum in the SCI group (adjusted p\u202f=\u202f0.021). In this region, MD negatively correlated with SCIM scores (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.51, p\u202f=\u202f0.022), whereas MK showed a positive correlation (r\u202f=\u202f0.482, p\u202f=\u202f0.038).DiscussionStructural changes in the corpus callosum may reflect impaired interhemispheric communication, linked to reduced functional independence after SCI. DTI and DKI could serve as complementary tools for identifying brain-based biomarkers, potentially informing recovery trajectories.",

      "title": "Biomarkers in ALS trials: from discovery to clinical utility",
      "content": "IntroductionMotor neuron disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron degeneration, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and eventual respiratory failure. Despite advances in understanding its pathology, effective therapies remain limited, underscoring the need for reliable biomarkers to aid early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and optimize clinical trials. This systematic review explores the role of biomarkers in ALS, focusing on their application in clinical trials to accelerate therapeutic development and enhance patient care.MethodsA comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, MedLine, and Google Scholar identified 93 studies investigating various biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain (NFL), inflammatory markers, genetic markers like SOD1 and C9orf72, and imaging modalities.ResultsNFL emerged as a robust biomarker, strongly correlating with disease progression and therapeutic response, and was frequently used in trials like RESCUE-ALS and CENTAUR. Genetic biomarkers, such as C9orf72 and SOD1 mutations, provided insights into ALS mechanisms and informed targeted therapeutic approaches. Emerging biomarkers, such as retroviral elements, show potential but require further validation. Included studies span key trials such as Lighthouse-II, MIROCALS, and MND-SMART.DiscussionThis systematic review evaluates which biomarkers are currently validated for monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response in ALS clinical trials, including protein, genetic, inflammatory, metabolic, and imaging markers. It also highlights the critical role of biomarkers in advancing MND clinical trials by enabling adaptive trial designs, patient stratification, and the use of surrogate endpoints, thereby reducing trial duration and improving efficiency. The review also highlights the translational gap between biomarker discovery and clinical application, emphasizing their potential to optimize trial design and patient stratification. While biomarkers like NFL have transformed trial methodologies, challenges such as disease specificity and inter-patient heterogeneity persist. Future efforts should focus on multimodal biomarker approaches to achieve comprehensive disease assessment and advance personalized therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for patients with MND.",

      "content": "Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) modulates autonomic function, but the influence of stimulation site and protocol remains unclear. In two within-subject experiments in young healthy participants (study 1: n = 15, study 2: n = 21), we examined how these parameters affect heart rate variability (HRV) as participants performed a visual detection task to stabilize arousal state while randomized stimulation blocks were applied. In study 1, burst (5 pulses at 25 Hz repeated every second), 1 Hz, and 25 Hz protocols were applied at the cymba conchae, with burst stimulation also delivered at the earlobe. In study 2, burst stimulation was applied at cymba conchae, fossa triangularis, tragus, and earlobe sites. While most HRV indices remained unchanged, stimulation-specific effects were observed for SDNN, a global marker of autonomic tone. Burst stimulation at both cymba conchae and earlobe sites produced notable SDNN changes, suggesting sensitivity of cardiac variability to stimulation protocols. These findings indicate that taVNS parameters modulate autonomic output and suggest that earlobe stimulation may evoke measurable autonomic responses under certain conditions. Further studies with larger samples and extended physiological and behavioral monitoring are warranted to confirm these conclusions.",
