      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all! I just released a <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/\">new HTML5 parser</a> that I'm really proud of. Happy to get any feedback on how to improve it from the python community on Reddit.</p> <p>I think the trickiest thing is if there is a &quot;market&quot; for a python only parser. Parsers are generally performance sensitive, and python just isn't the faster language. This library does parse the wikipedia startpage in 0.1s, so I think it's &quot;fast enough&quot;, but still unsure.</p> <p>Anyways, I got HEAVY help from AI to write it. I directed it all carefully (which I hope shows), but GitHub Copilot wrote all the code. Still took months of work off-hours to get it working. Wrote down a short blog post about that if it's interesting to anyone: <a href=\"https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/\">https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/</a></p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>It takes a string of html, and parses it into a nested node structure. To make sure you are seeing exactly what a browser would be seeing, it follows the html5 parsing rules. These are VERY complicated, and have evolved over the years.</p> <pre><code>from justhtml import JustHTML html = &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div id='main'&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot; doc = JustHTML(html) # 1. Traverse the tree # The tree is made of SimpleDomNode objects. # Each node has .name, .attrs, .children, and .parent root = doc.root # #document html_node = root.children[0] # html body = html_node.children[1] # body (children[0] is head) div = body.children[0] # div print(f&quot;Tag: {div.name}&quot;) print(f&quot;Attributes: {div.attrs}&quot;) # 2. Query with CSS selectors # Find elements using familiar CSS selector syntax paragraphs = doc.query(&quot;p&quot;) # All &lt;p&gt; elements main_div = doc.query(&quot;#main&quot;)[0] # Element with id=&quot;main&quot; bold = doc.query(&quot;div &gt; p b&quot;) # &lt;b&gt; inside &lt;p&gt; inside &lt;div&gt; # 3. Pretty-print HTML # You can serialize any node back to HTML print(div.to_html()) # Output: # &lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt; # &lt;p&gt; # Hello, # &lt;b&gt;world&lt;/b&gt; # ! # &lt;/p&gt; # &lt;/div&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> (e.g., Is it meant for production, just a toy project, etc.)</p> <p>This is meant for production use. It's fast. It has 100% test coverage. I have fuzzed it against 3 million seriously broken html strings. Happy to improve it further based on your feedback.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> (A brief comparison explaining how it differs from existing alternatives.)</p> <p>I've added a comparison table here: <a href=\"https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/?tab=readme-ov-file#comparison-to-other-parsers\">https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/?tab=readme-ov-file#comparison-to-other-parsers</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Huvet\"> /u/Huvet </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdgpmk/justhtml_a_pure_python_html5_parser_that_just/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pdgpmk/justhtml_a_pure_python_html5_parser_that_just/\">[comments]</a></span>",
