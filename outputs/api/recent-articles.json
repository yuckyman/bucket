      "title": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis drives stroke-associated pneumonia: mechanisms and targeted therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a central regulator of immune function, with growing research highlighting its association with the development of stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP). This review provides an overview of current research on the correlation between SAP and alterations in gut microbial composition and metabolism, with a focus on microbial imbalance, changes in key metabolites, and relevant biological mechanisms. Clinical and preclinical studies consistently report a decline in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, an increase in potentially harmful microbial species, reduced SCFAs levels, and elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. These disturbances appear to be associated with SAP progression through the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain and microbiota\u2013gut\u2013lung axes by affecting immune regulation and inflammatory responses. The review also examines microbiota-targeted treatment approaches, including dietary modification, antibiotic therapy, probiotics, microbiota-regulating compounds, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and respiratory microbiota transfer. A deeper understanding of how microbial disturbances are correlated with SAP may help explain the increased vulnerability to pulmonary infections following stroke and support the design of more effective, microbiota-based therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Reversible splenial lesion syndrome associated with Graves\u2019 disease and hepatic dysfunction: a case report",
      "content": "BackgroundReversible splenial lesion syndrome (RESLES) has been confirmed to induce severe psychiatric symptoms. This syndrome is a rare clinical condition with an etiology that remains unclear. According to current literature, the primary cause of RESLES may be associated with cytotoxic cerebral edema. First reported in 1999, reversible splenial syndrome may be triggered by bacterial or viral infections, epileptic seizures, metabolic disorders, hyperosmolar cerebral edema, and other factors. In this study, we report the case of RESLES in a patient with Graves\u2019 disease and liver dysfunction.Case presentationThe patient was a 17-year-old female adolescent with persistent headaches, dizziness, and nausea with vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested RESLES as the diagnosis. On admission, the patient presented with elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and positive thyroid-receptor antibodies (TRAb), meeting the diagnostic criteria for Graves\u2019 disease. Concurrently, the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also elevated. After hormone therapy, the patient\u2019s symptoms resolved, and imaging results returned to normal.ConclusionThis study presents a case of a patient with RESLES characterized by Graves\u2019 disease and liver function abnormalities, who was sensitive to anti-thyroid drug (methimazole) and hormone therapy (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) and had a favorable prognosis. This study contributed to expanding the clinical understanding of RESLES and suggests that, in clinical practice, autoimmune hyperthyroidism may be a novel trigger for RESLES, while concurrent liver dysfunction in this context requires further investigation.",

      "title": "Late-onset severe neutropenia in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis treated with ocrelizumab: case report and literature review",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo describe two cases of recurrent, delayed-onset severe neutropenia several months following ocrelizumab therapy in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).BackgroundA rare adverse effect of ocrelizumab is neutropenia, with late-onset neutropenia (LON) occurring more rarely. Literature guiding management of transient recurrent neutropenia in the setting of anti-CD20 therapy is lacking.MethodsCase 1: 38-year-old female emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Two years later, she developed severe symptomatic LON and required antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Ocrelizumab was held, patient switched to ozanimod, but neutropenia recurred. Due to concerns of MS progression, ocrelizumab was restarted after the patient transitioned to a telehealth setting, with no recurrence of neutropenia at one-year follow-up. Case 2: 35-year-old male emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab was resumed after absolute neutrophil count recovery. Two years later, he developed moderate symptomatic LON during a suspected viral illness. Ocrevus was discontinued at this point. A subsequent episode occurred 3\u202fmonths later during confirmed rhinovirus infection, again resolving promptly.ConclusionThese cases highlight the unpredictable nature of recurrent LON with ocrelizumab and suggest the possibility of immune-mediated marrow suppression, potentially unmasked or worsened by infections, rather than direct drug toxicity, highlighting the need for clearer management guidelines.",

      "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.

      "title": "Epileptic brain imaging by source localization CLARA supported by ictal-based semiology and VEEG in resource-limited settings",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.15352v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: People increasingly seek personal advice from large language models (LLMs), yet whether humans follow their advice, and its consequences for their well-being, remains unknown. In a longitudinal randomised controlled trial with a representative UK sample (N = 2,302), 75% of participants who had a 20-minute discussion with GPT-4o about health, careers or relationships subsequently reported following its advice. Based on autograder evaluations of chat transcripts, LLM advice rarely violated safety best practice. When queried 2-3 weeks later, participants who had interacted with personalised AI (with access to detailed user information) followed its advice more often in the real world and reported higher well-being than those advised by non-personalised AI. However, while receiving personal advice from AI temporarily reduced well-being, no differential long-term effects compared to a control emerged. Our results suggest that humans readily follow LLM advice about personal issues but doing so shows no additional well-being benefit over casual conversations.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.15342v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) requires not only technological innovation but also a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing energy access and carbon emissions. While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.",

This mismatch creates a cognitive gap, limiting designers' ability to articulate evolving intentions, critically evaluate outputs, and maintain creative agency. To address these challenges, we developed DesignerlyLoop, a visual node-based system that embeds LLM reasoning chains into the design workflow. The system enables designers to externalize and curate reasoning structures, iteratively organize intentions, and interact with LLMs as dynamic cognitive engines rather than static answer providers. We conducted a within-subject study with 20 designers, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, and found that DesignerlyLoop enhanced creative reflection, design quality, and interaction experience by supporting systematic engagement with both human and machine reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of structured, interactive visualization to transform human-AI co-creation into a reflective and iterative design process.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.15253v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective presentation skills are essential in education, professional communication, and public speaking, yet learners often lack access to high-quality exemplars or personalized coaching. Existing AI tools typically provide isolated functionalities such as speech scoring or script generation without integrating reference modeling and interactive feedback into a cohesive learning experience. We introduce a dual-agent system that supports presentation practice through two complementary roles: the Ideal Presentation Agent and the Coach Agent. The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback. Implemented on a robust backend with multi-model integration, voice cloning, and error handling mechanisms, the system demonstrates how AI-driven agents can provide engaging, human-centered, and scalable support for presentation skill development in both educational and professional contexts.",

Our comprehensive offline and pseudo-online evaluations demonstrate the framework's efficacy in real-time applications, including the nuanced control of robotic arms. The robustness of our approach is further validated through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, marking a significant step towards versatile, subject-independent BCI applications.
