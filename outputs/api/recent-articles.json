      "content": "Infrared small target detection has long faced significant challenges due to the extremely small size of targets, low contrast, and the scarcity of annotated data. To tackle these issues, we propose a wavelet-recalibrated semi-supervised network (WRSSNet) that integrates synthetic data augmentation, feature reconstruction, and semi-supervised learning, aiming to fully exploit the potential of unlabeled infrared images under limited supervision. We construct a dataset containing 843 visible-light...",

      "content": "Cognitive decline is a natural part of aging, though its progression varies significantly among individuals. There is a great deal of evidence showing that exercise is one of the most promising lifestyle factors that can both improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia by causing molecular, cellular, structural, and functional changes. In this chapter, based on observational studies and intervention studies, we will briefly outline the effects of physical activity and exercise on...",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a valuable tool for investigating neurobiological markers in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While previous studies have identified abnormal functional connectivity in ASD children compared to typically developing (TD) peers, brain connectivity dynamics and their associations with autism symptoms and cognitive abilities remain underexplored. We analyzed fNIRS data from 44 children (30 boys, 21 ASD/23 TD) aged 2.08-6.67...",

Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), traditionally perceived as a simple and generic modality, is on the verge of a significant transformation. Guided by advances in brain-state decoding and adaptive algorithms, TENS can evolve into a precision neuromodulation system tailored to individual needs. By integrating multimodal neuroimaging-including the spatial...",

This review explored the effectiveness of Electroencephalography (EEG) and function Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) in decoding Motor Imagery (MI) movements for both offline and online BCI systems. EEG has been the dominant non-invasive neuroimaging modality due to its high temporal resolution and accessibility; however, it is limited by high susceptibility...",
