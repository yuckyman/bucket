      "title": "Leveraging neuroinformatics to understand cognitive phenotypes in elite athletes through systems neuroscience",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

      "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

      "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

      "title": "Personalized beta band HD-tACS over the left SMA improves speech and limb movement by modulating prefrontal delta oscillations in neurotypical young adults",
      "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",

      "title": "Closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum modulation depth in temporal interference electrical brain stimulation",
      "content": "Objective. In temporal interference (TI) transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), an emerging brain stimulation technique, the interference of two high-frequency currents with a small frequency difference is used to target specific brain regions with better focality than in standard tES. While the magnitude of the modulation depth has been previously investigated, an explicit formula for the direction in which this modulation is maximized has been lacking. This work provides a novel closed-form analytical expression for the orientation of maximum modulation depth in TI tES. We also found a secondary orientation where the modulation depth has a local maximum. Moreover, we provide closed-form analytical formulas for this orientation as well as for the modulation depth along this orientation. To our knowledge, these closed-form expressions and the presence of the secondary maximum have not been previously reported. Approach. We derive compact analytical expressions and validate them through comprehensive computational simulations using a realistic human head model. We also provide a complete analytical derivation of the widely used formula for the maximum modulation depth magnitude stated in Grossman et al, 2017. Main results. Our simulations demonstrate that the modulation depth predicted with our new analytical direction formula is indeed the maximum compared to other directions. The derived closed-form expression provides a faster and more accurate alternative to iterative numerical optimization methods used in previous studies to estimate this direction. Furthermore, we found that due to interference in 3D, the modulation depth along the secondary maximum orientation can be of similar strength to the maximum modulation depth intensity when interfering electric field vectors are significantly misaligned. Finally, we show that by modifying the ratio of the injected current strengths, it is possible to steer these directions and fine-tune the stimulation along a desired direction of interest. Significance. Overall, this work provides a detailed treatment of TI electric fields in 3D. The presented closed-form expressions for the directions of maximum and secondary maximum modulation depths are relevant for the better interpretation of both simulated and experimental results in TI studies by allowing comparison with neuronal orientations in the brain.",

      "title": "Disrupted periodic spatiotemporal pattern and dynamic reorganization of its basic states in generalized epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. The anti-correlation between the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN) is a stable characteristic of normal brain activity. However, in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE), this anti-correlation is often disrupted and strongly associated with epileptic seizures. This study aims to use periodic spatiotemporal patterns (PSTP) analysis to elucidate the relationship between the DMN-TPN anti-correlation and epileptic activity, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying IGE. Approach. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to analyze PSTP in both healthy controls and IGE patients. A pattern-finding algorithm was initially applied to identify repeated spatiotemporal patterns, followed by a novel PSTP-finding algorithm to uncover dynamic periodic patterns through analysis of fluctuations in the DMN-TPN anti-correlation. The Hilbert transform was applied to capture the underlying basic states of these periodic patterns. Additionally, the relationship between period length and intrinsic neural timescales (INT) was explored. Main results. IGE patients exhibited a reduced DMN-TPN anti-correlation, particularly during TPN-dominant states. Additionally, IGE patients exhibited greater dynamic instability in basic states, marked by more frequent transitions between transitional states. Furthermore, lower correlations between period length and INT were observed in cognitive regions of IGE patients. Significance. These findings suggest that dynamic switching between the DMN and TPN in IGE is weaker and less balanced, with disruptions in periodic rhythms linked to cognitive impairments. The proposed PSTP framework provides new insights into the abnormal rhythms of IGE from a spatiotemporal perspective.",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
