      "title": "An entropic explanation of insistence on sameness in autism",
      "content": "PurposeAn information theory-based framework is proposed in attempt to explain insistence on sameness in autism as an instance of a general behavior pattern in which an individual tries to reduce surprise and uncertainty. It offers a new definition of autism as an impairment in which cognitive functions are restricted to discrimination, memorization and prediction of tangible properties of the environment.MethodsAn analogy between insistence on sameness and constrained minimization of the entropy metric is observed and examined for a set of assumptions that describe cognitive limitations of a person with autism. The metric is given by the formula DH(R, M) = H(R|M)+H(M|R), where R represents sequences of random stimuli, M is a memory that stores and retrieves them, and where H(\u00b7|\u00b7) denotes their conditional entropies interpreted as surprise and uncertainty, respectively.ResultsIt is first inferred that to minimize the metric an individual can learn about R (and store that knowledge in M) or can restrict R to the already known M. Then, it is concluded that insistence on sameness is a manifestation of the latter. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed framework: (1) Helps to quantify the concepts of surprise, uncertainty, sensory overload and deprivation, anxiety, comfort zone, disappointment, disorientation, pedantry, rigidness, observance or aberrant precision. (2) Leads to a list of guidelines for learning therapies and daily care routines, and allows them to be defined as optimization algorithms and implemented as programs for robotic live-in caregivers. (3) Can be validated with the help of a Turing test-like approach that requires no experiments involving individuals with autism.ConclusionThe framework\u2014if positively validated\u2014will provide advantages of both theoretical and practical importance: it explains the insistent on sameness as a consequence of cognitive restrictions and offers formal foundations and design guidelines for therapies aimed at improving self-reliance of individuals with autism in basic activities of daily living.",

      "title": "Clinical exome sequencing identifies novel gene variants associated with ischemic stroke in the Saudi Tabuk population",
      "content": "BackgroundVariants linked to the risk of ischemic stroke have been discovered through genome-wide association studies (GWASs). These variations frequently have little consequences that lack apparent biological significance. Hence, these findings demonstrate that exome sequencing can be highly relevant to stroke, even though stroke is a complex phenotype with various diseases and risk factors.MethodologyIn this case-control investigation, we used ARMS genotyping to investigate the distribution of polymorphic variations in genes associated with stroke susceptibility. In addition to examine the novel gene variations associated with ischemic stroke we utilized the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform for whole-exome sequencing (WES).ResultsResults identified 11 novel gene variants in the GSTT4 gene by targeted whole-exome sequencing, including one deletion GSTT4p.Asn232LysfsTer6, one insertion c.688_689insCG, and 9 SNVs c.699\u202fT\u202f>\u202fC, c.701C\u202f>\u202fG, c.708G\u202f>\u202fT, c.710\u202fT\u202f>\u202fG, c.712A\u202f>\u202fG, c.712A\u202f>\u202fG, c.718A\u202f>\u202fT, c.719G\u202f>\u202fA, c.721A\u202f>\u202fT, c.722G\u202f>\u202fT in the ischemic stroke patients. We also identified several rare, intermediate, and most common gene variants in cholesterol associated genes LDLR, LDLRAD2, LDLRAD3, APOA2, APOA3, APOA4, APOA5, and PCSK9. Also, several common gene variants were reported in MTHFR, KLF14, eNOS3, and ACE by whole-exome sequencing. Furthermore, the eNOS3-GG and eNOS3-GT genotypes were associated with susceptibility to ischemic stroke (OR\u202f=\u202f1.95, p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionThis case-control study identified 11 novel GSTT4 variants and several known polymorphisms associated with ischemic stroke risk in Saudi patients. These findings highlight population-specific genetic factors that warrant further functional and large-scale validation.",

      "title": "The complex impact of auditory error direction, magnitude, and exposure on corrective responses",
      "content": "PurposeWhen encountering errors, the brain produces within-production corrective responses to compensate for the errors. The brain also develops adaptive responses to ensure the accuracy of future productions. This study examined the impact of the number of exposures to errors with different characteristics on corrective and adaptive responses.MethodsWe designed a compensation paradigm to apply three perturbation magnitudes in two directions within the two-dimensional formant space: (1) a concurrent increase in the first formant and decrease in the second formant, acoustically shifting /\u025b/ toward /\u00e6/ (\u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations), and (2) a concurrent increase in the first formant and increase in the second formant, shifting /\u025b/ toward the outside of the vowel space (\u025b-to-out perturbations). To calculate corrective responses in perturbed trials, we determined the difference between formants in the late (300\u2013400 ms) and early (0\u2013100 ms) intervals of the vowel. We estimated adaptive responses in unperturbed trials by calculating formant changes in the early interval of the post-perturbation trial relative to the early interval of the pre-perturbation trial. We examined the responses in the first and second halves of trials in each condition to determine the effect of exposure to perturbations.ResultsWe found that (1) corrective responses to \u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations were larger and proportionally larger for small perturbations in the first half of perturbed trials, (2) adaptive responses were measurable after exposure to a single perturbation, and (3) strikingly, both corrective and adaptive response directions were generally in the participant-specific \u025b-\u026a direction, regardless of the perturbation direction. This preferred response direction was in the opposite direction of the \u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations but was perpendicular to the \u025b-to-out perturbations.ConclusionOur findings suggest that the brain responds more to small and natural-sounding errors (\u025b-to-\u00e6 perturbations) than large and unnatural errors (\u025b-to-out perturbations). The brain\u2019s biases in selecting movements may influence error compensation, leading to responses that prioritize preferred movements even when they do not fully correct errors (e.g., responding in the \u025b-\u026a direction for \u025b-to-out perturbations). Finally, as the brain encounters more unexpected errors, it may evaluate them differently and respond less to them.",

These are my comfort languages but I'm having difficulty breaking out of my shell and trying projects that really push me. With java, I primarily use it for robotics and small videogames but it feels rather clunky with having to setup a virtual machine and other small nuances that just get in the way of MY program (not sure if I explained that properly). Still though, it was my first language that I learned so I feel safe coding with it. Ever since I started coding with python (which I really like compared to dealing with java) all of my projects, whether that be simulations, games, math stuff, stick to that oop java structure because that's what I started with and that just seems to be the most organized to me. However, there is always room for improvement and I definitely want to try new programming structures or ways to organize code. Is oop the best? Is oop just for beginners?
