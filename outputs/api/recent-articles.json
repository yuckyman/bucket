      "content": "INTRODUCTION: Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has emerged as a pivotal branch in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and elevated information transfer rate (ITR). However, substantial inter-subject variability in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals poses a significant challenge to current SSVEP frequency recognition. In particular, it is difficult to achieve high cross-subject classification accuracy in calibration-free scenarios, and the...",

      "content": "In recent years, participant engagement initiatives in research on implanted neural devices have significantly increased. However, there remains little consensus on the motivations, goals, and best practices for engagement efforts. Drawing on the concept of participatory epistemic injustice, we argue that one core ethical motivation for engagement is epistemic in nature. Based on their subject positions, participants should be key knowledge contributors to implanted neurotech research....",

      "content": "APOE4 is the largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, but the cellular mechanisms by which APOE variants influence risk of disease remain incompletely understood. We have previously found that APOE4 expression led to the intracellular accumulation of lipid droplets in oligodendrocytes, causing decreased myelination. However, the mechanisms by which APOE4 alters lipid metabolism are not fully understood. Here, we leveraged a genome-wide CRISPR screen and ATAC-sequencing in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived oligodendrocytes to dissect APOE4's lipid-associated mechanisms of action. Using these approaches, we identified decreased Wnt signaling, and overactive GSK3b activity, as regulators of lipid droplet accumulation in oligodendrocytes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of GSK3b reduced lipid droplets in APOE4 oligodendrocytes, and increased myelination in three-dimensional iPSC-derived brain organoids. Finally, we show that pharmacological inhibition of GSK3b reduces lipid droplets and improves myelination in APOE4;PS19 Tau transgenic mice. Together, our results provide a framework for understanding the mediation of APOE4-related changes to oligodendrocyte lipid metabolism and myelination.",

      "content": "Background/Objectives: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss, muscle weakness, and respiratory dysfunction, often culminating in ventilatory failure. Evidence suggests that High-Definition Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) may modulate motor cortical excitability and potentially influence motor and respiratory function in ALS. This study aims to evaluate the effects of home-based HD-tDCS applied...",
