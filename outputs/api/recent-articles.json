      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "title": "Intrinsic interval timing, not temporal prediction, underlies ramping dynamics in visual and parietal cortex",
      "content": "Neural activity following regular sensory events can reflect either elapsed time since the previous event (temporal signaling) or temporal predictions and prediction errors about the next event (temporal predictive processing). These mechanisms are often confounded, yet dissociating them is essential for understanding neural circuit computations. We addressed this by performing two-photon calcium imaging from distinct cell types (excitatory, VIP and SST) in layer 2/3 of visual and posterior parietal cortex (PPC), while awake mice passively viewed audio-visual stimuli under temporal contexts with different inter-stimulus interval (ISI) distributions. Computational modeling revealed distinct functional clusters of neurons, including stimulus-activated (ramp-down) and stimulus-inhibited (ramp-up) categories, with distinct kinetics and area/cell-type biases. Importantly, all functional clusters were invariant to temporal predictability, shifted immediately when temporal statistics changed, and were identical between naive and experienced mice. Population decoding revealed that clusters with heterogeneous kinetics differed in how well they represented interval information, such that together they tiled elapsed time and produced a distributed, learning-independent population code for time. These results provide strong evidence against temporal predictive processing in V1/PPC under passive conditions and instead demonstrate intrinsic coding of interval timing, redefining the mechanistic origin of ramping and omission-related activity in sensory cortex. We discuss how these dynamics align with stimulus-reset attractor frameworks, and propose that temporal predictive processing is more likely implemented in other circuits or recruited in V1/PPC during task-engaged behavior.",

      "title": "Alpha-synuclein overexpression reduces neural activity within a basal ganglia vocal nucleus in a zebra finch model",
      "content": "Vocal motor impairments, including changes in pitch, loudness, and timing are prevalent in Parkinsons Disease (PD) and a target for early intervention and treatment, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these impairments are not understood, motivating work in animal models. The adult male zebra finch songbird is uniquely poised for these studies given vocally-dedicated brain nuclei and a quantifiable output (birdsong). Our prior publication revealed that injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV5) expressing the human (h) alpha-synuclein (hSNCA, a-syn) gene into basal ganglia vocal nucleus Area X results in higher levels of insoluble a-syn protein and changes reminiscent of human PD including softer, shorter, and reduced number of vocalizations compared to AAV5 controls. Here, we test the hypothesis that AAV-hSNCA overexpression reduces the firing rate of specific neuronal sub-types in Area X using in vivo recordings in anesthetized finches. Five classes of neurons were differentiated in AAV-treated finches based on waveform width (narrow vs. wide) and firing rates (low vs. fast). Wide-waveform/low-rate activity is a consistent feature of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a dominant cell type in Area X and in mammalian basal ganglia. Reduced firing rates and enhanced post-peak rebound were detected in the AAV-hSNCA group for putative MSN neurons compared to AAV controls. No differences in firing rate nor waveform shape were detected for the narrow waveform neurons. Our findings provide the first characterization of early a-syn-driven neural activity changes in vocal control neurocircuitry.",

      "content": "Finger tapping is widely used to investigate sensorimotor brain responses, yet it remains unclear whether shared neural codes for complex finger movements exist across individuals, given the highly individual-specific topography of the sensorimotor cortex. We combined spherical searchlight Procrustes hyperalignment on 7-Tesla fMRI data with between-subject classification to investigate the existence of a shared latent neural architecture encoding sequential finger movements in the human sensorimotor cortex. Our model afforded above-chance level accuracy in both the contralateral and ipsilateral areas, suggesting that such a high-dimensional neural information space exists, is traceable, and spreads over the sensorimotor cortex. Critically, these high-dimensional neural codes were identified without task-specific training and cannot be attributed to error-related activity. These findings establish universal organizational principles of motor sequence encoding and pave the way for personalized neurotechnologies, scalable brain-computer interfaces, and cross-subject models for motor learning and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Cerebellar growth is associated with domain-specific cerebral maturation and socio-linguistic behavioral outcomes",
      "content": "The cerebellum's involvement in cognitive functions is increasingly recognized, yet its developmental contribution to cognition remains poorly understood. The cerebellum undergoes rapid development in early life, paralleling major cognitive and behavioral changes. Although clinical studies have linked early cerebellar disruptions to profound developmental deficits, it remains largely unclear how typical cerebellar maturation supports the development of cognitive functions and how it interacts with broader brain development. Here, we apply a normative modeling framework to map cerebellar volumetric growth from infancy to young adulthood (N = 751; ages 1-21 years). Using lobular and functional cerebellar parcellations, we comprehensively characterize typical cerebellar development and examine how it aligns with cerebral development and behavioral outcomes. Across parcellations, posterior higher association areas consistently show steeper growth trajectories than anterior sensorimotor areas. Cerebellar and cerebral areas with similar functional roles demonstrate coordinated maturation, and volumetric growth in the posterior cerebellum relates to individual differences in socio-linguistic behaviors. These findings establish a comprehensive reference for typical cerebellar development, highlight cerebellar co-maturation with the cerebral cortex, and underscore the cerebellum's role in supporting emerging higher cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Infant Brains Tick at 4Hz - Resonance Properties of the Developing Visual System",
      "content": "Neural rhythms of the infant brain are not well understood. Testing the rhythmic properties of the adult visual system with periodic or broadband visual stimulation elicited neural resonance phenomena at ~10Hz alpha rhythm. Here, we extend this approach to reveal the inherent rhythmic properties of the infant brain. Eight-month-olds (N = 42) were presented with visual stimuli flickering at discrete frequencies (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 30Hz) and broadband (i.e., aperiodic) stimulation, while recording a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG). As predicted, infants' visual system entrained to the harmonics of the periodic stimulation frequencies (first to third). In addition, a 4Hz rhythm emerged independent of stimulation frequency. Critically, the impulse response function (IRF) of the broadband sequence revealed a perceptual echo of visual information at 4Hz. This echo lasted for about 1 second (i.e. four cycles), extended into frontal sensors, and selectively resonated the 4Hz component of the input signal. In a complementary adult assessment, we confirm an alpha response upon periodic and broadband stimulation in the present paradigm for the mature visual system. To conclude, perturbing the infant visual system elicited a neural response and resonant activity at the 4Hz theta rhythm, which contrasts with the 10Hz alpha rhythm found in the adult visual system. Neural processing dynamics are thus essential to understand early brain development in full.",

      "title": "Characterization of the central sulcus pli-de-passage fronto-parietal moyen in > 1000 human brains",
      "content": "The pli-de-passage fronto-parietal moyen (PPfpm), a deep cerebral fold of the human brain, presents as a common though small elevation at the central sulcus (CS) fundus where it connects the pre- and postcentral gyri at the level of the sensorimotor hand area. Given the PPfpm's location, single case-reports of its association with the functional sensorimotor hand area, and evidence linking it to the somato-cognitive action network, it holds potential as an anatomical landmark for the sensorimotor region. To characterize the macroscopic morphology of the PPfpm and evaluate its relevance as a reliable and easily detectable anatomical landmark, methods for observer-independent characterization of cortical sulci and structures were adapted and developed to investigate the PPfpm in a large dataset. For 1112 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult S1200 Release, CS depth profiles were computed from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and an algorithm was developed to automatically extract the PPfpm from these depth profiles. Based on the extraction of two key features approximating the PPfpm at its peak height (PPfpm-I) and its lateral end (PPfpm-II), a principal description of the PPfpm's position and extent as influenced by hemisphere and sex was conducted. Analyses revealed the PPfpm as a near-universal cerebral fold in the adult human brain, consistently located at mid-height within the CS with a strong association to the CS sulcal pits. Though commonly of a small extent, the PPfpm can be reliably identified in CS depth profiles and in structural MRI data. By providing a systematic, modern macroanatomical characterization of the PPfpm in a large cohort with rigorous quality control, the present study demonstrates the potential of the PPfpm to serve as a robust anatomical landmark for the sensorimotor hand area of the human brain.",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
