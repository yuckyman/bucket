      "title": "CASK hypomorph mice display cone photoreceptor dysfunction",
      "content": "Variants in the X-linked gene CASK are associated with neurodevelopmental defects. Animal model studies have demonstrated that conditions such as cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, and optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) are related to loss-of-function (LOF) in the CASK gene. CASK variants are associated with multiple ocular conditions spanning both anterior and posterior segments of the eye including retinopathies. Both Cask heterozygous knockout (+/-) mice and Cask knock-in (KI) mice with reduced Cask expression have been shown to display ONH. Cask (+/-) mice displayed no defects in retinal structure or function. Here, we have systematically examined the Cask (KI) mice. Our results demonstrate that the anterior segment of the eye in Cask (KI) mice does not display any obvious phenotype. Cask (KI) mice however show a reduced visual acuity in optomotor response. The retina of Cask (KI) mice does not exhibit any major changes in their structure, vasculature, or gene expression pattern. We, however, uncovered a specific dysfunction of the cone receptor in Cask (KI) mice using electroretinogram (ERG). Mechanistically this dysfunction arises due to lowered levels of cone-specific opsin (opsin1mw) in Cask (KI) mice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of retinal dysfunction in an animal model with CASK gene suppression. We infer that like ONH and cerebellar hypoplasia, retinopathy also may represent CASK LOF.",

      "title": "Transcranial direct current stimulation combined with exercise therapy for chronic low back pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundChronic low-back pain (CLBP) is a leading cause of disability, with current treatments offering only modest benefits. Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) may enhance exercise therapy by modulating cortical excitability and pain-inhibitory pathways. This systematic review and meta-analysis quantified the additive effect of combining tDCS with structured exercise in adults with CLBP.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Embase, and CNKI up to 25 September 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing active tDCS plus identical exercise therapy vs. sham tDCS plus the same exercise in adults with CLBP (\u2265 12 weeks) were included. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and standardized mean difference (SMD) were calculated for pain and function, respectively.GRADE was used to assess certainty.ResultsFive RCTs (n = 195) were included. For pain intensity (4 studies, n = 173), tDCS showed a significant additive effect (WMD = \u22120.99, 95% CI: \u22121.68 to \u22120.31, p = 0.006, I2 = 60.1%). For physical function (five studies, n = 195), the effect was favorable but non-significant (SMD = \u22120.65, 95% CI: \u22121.87 to 0.57, p = 0.28, I2 = 90.7%). Meta-regression indicated intervention duration significantly moderated functional outcomes (\u03b2 = 0.56, p < 0.001). GRADE certainty was moderate for pain and low for function.ConclusionAnodal tDCS combined with exercise provides a modest but significant additional reduction in pain intensity for CLBP. Longer intervention duration may enhance functional outcomes. Clinical significance should be interpreted cautiously. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm these findings and optimize stimulation parameters.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251151315, identifier CRD420251151315.",
