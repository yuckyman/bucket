      "title": "Assessment of Motoneuronal Regeneration and Wallerian Degeneration Following Axotomy in Postnatal Mice",
      "content": "Nerve injuries during early postnatal stages results in markedly different outcomes compared to adult injury, with significant motoneuronal death masking potential regenerative capacity. This study systematically evaluated motoneuronal survival, axonal regeneration, and Wallerian degeneration following peripheral nerve injury at distinct postnatal stages (P4, P10, and P30) in mice. Using ChAT-Cre/Ai9(RCL-tdT) and ChAT-Cre/RiboTag transgenic models, we assessed both histological and transcriptomic responses after sciatic nerve lesions. Injury at P4 induced substantial motoneuron death ([~]50%), whilst P10 and P30 animals showed minimal neuronal loss. However, when correcting for neuronal survival, P4 mice demonstrated the highest regenerative capacity, with surviving neurons achieving 100% axonal regeneration. Motoneuron-specific translatome analysis revealed that P30 animals activated a robust regeneration-associated gene (RAG) programme, including classical markers such as Atf3, Gap43, and Ngfr. In contrast, P4 neurons showed minimal RAG upregulation, suggesting they retain an intrinsic growth state that facilitates regeneration without requiring transcriptional reprogramming. P10 animals exhibited a transitional phenotype with impaired RAG activation and reduced regenerative capacity. Wallerian degeneration proceeded efficiently across all developmental stages, with age-specific differences in myelin clearance kinetics and macrophage recruitment. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed consistent downregulation of myelination programmes and upregulation of pro-regenerative markers following injury, regardless of age. These findings indicate that regenerative capacity is primarily determined by the intrinsic growth state of motoneurons rather than extrinsic factors.",

      "title": "Exploring internal representations of self-supervised networks: few-shot learning abilities and comparison with human semantics and recognition of objects",
      "content": "Recent advances in self-supervised learning have attracted significant attention from both machine learning and neuroscience. This is primarily because self-supervised methods do not require annotated supervisory information, making them applicable to training artificial networks without relying on large amounts of curated data, and potentially offering insights into how the brain adapts to its environment in an unsupervised manner. Although several previous studies have elucidated the correspondence between neural representations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and biological systems, the extent to which unsupervised or self-supervised learning can explain the human-like acquisition of categorically structured information remains less explored. In this study, we investigate the correspondence between the internal representations of DCNNs trained using a self-supervised contrastive learning algorithm and human semantics and recognition. To this end, we employ a few-shot learning evaluation procedure, which measures the ability of DCNNs to recognize novel concepts from limited exposure, to examine the inter-categorical structure of the learned representations. Two comparative approaches are used to relate the few-shot learning outcomes to human semantics and recognition, with results suggesting that the representations acquired through contrastive learning are well aligned with human cognition. These findings underscore the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning frameworks to model learning mechanisms similar to those of the human brain, particularly in scenarios where explicit supervision is unavailable, such as in human infants prior to language acquisition.",

      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "title": "On collective behavior in C. elegans",
      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",
