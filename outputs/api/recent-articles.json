Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

We used a modified oddball paradigm in which a little dot appeared at one of many locations around an circle (see Figure 1). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1112\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f68d38c2-c87c-4512-b0a7-fbecd75969ff/Figure_2.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1728\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 2</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">On each trial, participants pressed one button if the circle was close to one of the four cardinal axes (left, right, top, and bottom) and a different button if it was close to one of the four diagonals (upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right). One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks). As is usual in oddball paradigms, the P3b was much larger for trials in the rare category than for trials in the frequent category (see Figure 2).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/89260e9e-be6e-48b1-adc4-58b77a418deb/Figure_3.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1996\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The main question was whether the location of the dot was encoded in working memory better for the oddball trials than for the standard trials. To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "content": "The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line is widely used as an in vitro model of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the lack of standardized protocols for assessing A{beta} toxicity - including differentiation strategies for SH-SY5Y cells - limits the comparability of results across studies. To address these issues, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate how methodological factors influence A{beta}-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. We included 359 eligible studies encompassing 1,192 MTT-based comparisons of cell viability between A{beta}-treated and control SH-SY5Y cells. A three-level meta-analysis estimated mean cell viability after A{beta} exposure at 63% of control levels (95% CI [61.6; 64.3]), with very high heterogeneity (I2=99.6%). Meta-regression identified significant associations between increased toxicity and higher A{beta} concentrations, longer exposure durations, and the use of peptide preparations described as fibrils. Conversely, differentiation protocols, duration, and cell density did not significantly influence toxicity outcomes. Reporting quality was often poor, with frequent omissions regarding cell line origin, authentication, contamination testing, A{beta} preparation details and nature of the experimental unit. Overall, our findings show robust A{beta} toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells, primarily driven by dose, exposure time, and A{beta} aggregation state, but not cell differentiation status. Our conclusions highlight the critical need for better reporting of A{beta} exposure parameters to enhance reproducibility and translational potential in AD research.",

      "content": "Reactive astrogliosis in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) involves profound changes in the morphology, metabolism and secretion profile of astrocytes, but whether astrogliosis is beneficial or harmful, and under which conditions, remain open questions. Here we report an unexpected neuroprotective function of death receptor p75NTR in astrocytes through its ability to regulate cholesterol metabolism. AD knock-in mice expressing signaling-deficient p75NTR variants in astrocytes showed enhanced Abeta burden, brain histopathology and cognitive impairment, even when variants were introduced late in the disease process. Astrocytes expressing dysfunctional p75NTR variants showed impaired uptake of Abeta oligomers, and their conditioned medium enhanced Abeta production in AD neurons. p75NTR signaling negatively regulated astrocyte cholesterol biosynthesis and secretion, while cholesterol depletion restored Abeta uptake in mutant astrocytes and reduced Abeta production in AD neurons. In agreement with the role of astrocyte-derived cholesterol, statin treatment reverted the effects of astrocyte p75NTR mutants on AD neuropathology. Thus, although neuronal p75NTR has been widely recognized to amplify AD, astrocyte p75NTR plays a neuroprotective role.",

      "content": "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a non-invasive neuroimaging technique that enables in vivo evaluation of white matter microstructure, providing sensitivity to tissue abnormalities caused by disease. Glaucoma, the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and axonal damage in the optic nerve, leading to degeneration along the entire visual pathway. This degeneration includes secondary effects on fiber crossings within the optic chiasm, which are challenging to characterize with conventional diffusion models. In this study, we evaluated 31 patients with asymmetric glaucoma and 31 healthy controls using advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging methods, including Diffusion Tensor Imaging, Constrained Spherical Deconvolution, multi-tensor fit via Multi-Resolution Discrete Search method, and Fixel-Based Analysis. We found significant differences of diffusion metrics in white matter tracts of the visual system, including the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracts, and optic radiations. Moreover, diffusion metrics correlated with clinical ophthalmological parameters such as cup-to-disc ratio, visual field mean deviation, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. These findings support the use of advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging models as sensitive tools for detecting Wallerian degeneration and resolving complex white matter architecture in the human visual pathway, and demonstrate their utility to study other fiber-crossing regions throughout the brain.",

      "content": "Background Alcohol misuse increases Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, however the mechanisms linking these conditions are unknown. In rodents, chronic and acute ethanol increases amyloid-[beta] (A[beta]), however those studies have been limited to a single sex or brain region. Objective This study explored how adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE), alters A[beta] in multiple regions of the brain in female and male TgF344-AD rats as they age. Methods From P28-P58, female and male TgF344-AD rats were administered either water (CON) or 5.0 g/kg ethanol (AIE; 20% ethanol w/v) via intragastric gavage on a 2-day on/off cycle. In Experiment 1, A[beta] was measured in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), piriform cortex (PC), entorhinal cortex (EC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), and dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) in 6- and 10-month-old rats. In Experiment 2, in vivo microdialysis was used in 3-month-old female rats to measure how ethanol directly modulates A[beta]; levels in the dHPC. Results In the OFC, PC, EC, vHPC, and dHPC, A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 was higher in 6-month-old female TgF344-AD rats compared to males. However, at 10 months A[beta]40 and A[beta]42 levels were only elevated in the dHPC of AIE-treated females, compared to all other groups. An acute ethanol challenge at 3 months selectively evoked a sustained increase in ISF A[beta]40 levels in AIE-treated females. Conclusions In aged females, the dHPC is a region sensitive to ethanol-associated A[beta] pathology. This may be due to disruptions in A{beta} clearance in early life, which may have an additive effect on A[beta] aggregation over the lifespan.",

      "title": "Loss of ovarian function and estrogen therapy remodel the brain's synaptic and metabolic proteome",
      "content": "Menopause is linked to cognitive decline and reduced brain metabolism, while estrogen (E2) therapy has been shown to mitigate these effects. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which ovarian hormones and E2 influence neuroprotection is essential for developing strategies to maintain brain health in women. In this study, we examined how the loss of ovarian hormones, with or without E2 treatment, affects the brain proteome and mitochondrial energy production in aged female C57BL/6J mice (36-40 weeks). The mice underwent sham or ovariectomy (OVX) surgery and were fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks; six weeks after surgery, OVX mice received either sesame oil or E2 treatment for four weeks. Proteomic analysis of brain homogenates revealed 4,992 proteins regulated by E2, with pathway analysis showing increased signaling proteins related to synaptogenesis. OVX reduced proteins involved in synaptic function, branched-chain amino acid and ketone metabolism, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (Complexes I, IV, and V), while E2 restored protein expression within these pathways. Despite alterations in OxPhos proteins, basal and state 3 mitochondrial respiration remained unchanged, although notable impairments to Complex IV enzymatic activity were apparent in OVX, but not following E2 replacement. Overall, these results indicate that E2 supports brain health by maintaining proteins crucial for synaptic integrity and metabolism, and by reducing the decline in mitochondrial bioenergetics associated with menopause.",

      "title": "TDP-43 dysfunction leads to impaired proteostasis and predisposes mice to worse neurological outcomes after brain injury",
      "content": "Background: Pathological TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) dysfunction is associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders. However, the mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and neurodegeneration is poorly understood and likely involves a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors. A major risk factor for neurodegenerative disease is exposure to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Here, we investigated the synergistic interplay between TDP-43 dysfunction and TBI in a murine model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)/ frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Methods: A model of TDP-43 dysfunction caused by a knock-in Q331K mutation in Tardbp was combined with a mild model of TBI. Control conditions included both WT mice and mice with sham surgery. Animals were evaluated for behavioral deficits at timepoints pre- and post-surgery. Additionally, post-mortem brain tissues were examined using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics together with histological and biochemical analyses. Results: Expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 in vivo caused deficits in multiple branches of the proteostasis network, including protein folding, protein synthesis, and protein turnover. Examples include mis-expression of chaperones and genes within the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway in mutant TDP-43 versus WT mice. Further, mutant TDP-43 expression correlated with reduced thermostability of proteins associated with the ribosome and the chaperonin containing TCP-1 complex. In response to TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibited significantly worse neurological outcomes relative to WT animals. Heightened neurological deficits in mutant TDP-43 mice following TBI coincided with a robust upregulation of proteostasis- and stress-related genes at the transcript level. However, this upregulation was not detected at the protein level. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that expression of dysfunctional TDP-43 leads to deficits within the proteostasis network in vivo at baseline. Despite an upregulation of proteostasis-related genes at the transcript level in mutant TDP-43 mice after TBI, mutant TDP-43 mice exhibit an impaired response to, and recovery from, brain trauma relative to their WT counterparts. Restoring proteostasis is expected to protect against the detrimental effects of TDP-43 dysfunction, especially under stress conditions that promote neurodegenerative disease.",
