      "title": "What Is a Generative Model? Definitions, Disagreements, and Evaluation in Human Neuroimaging",
      "content": "The term generative model is widely used in human neuroimaging; however, its meaning is often left implicit. Prompted by observations and discussions at the 2025 Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Annual Meeting, we surveyed members of the neuroimaging community to examine how generative models are defined, used, and evaluated in practice. Responses revealed some agreement on functional criteria--such as a model's ability to simulate data--alongside marked disagreement about whether specific, widely used methods should be considered generative models. Evaluative priorities also varied across respondents, though out-of-sample generalization and interpretability were consistently emphasized. Rather than proposing a single definition, this perspective highlights the diversity of current usage and argues for greater clarity when the term is invoked.",

      "title": "Early-Stage Corticostriatal Circuit Hyperactivity Impairs Cholinergic Function and Cognitive Flexibility in an Alzheimer's Model",
      "content": "Cognitive flexibility deficits are a hallmark of early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the 5xFAD mouse model of AD neuropathology exhibited early deficits in instrumental reversal learning, indicating cognitive inflexibility preceding spatial memory deficits. This impairment was associated with excessive neuronal reactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS), key regions for goal-directed behavior. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that mPFC neurons in young 5xFAD mice were hyperexcitable and received elevated excitatory input. Moreover, the mPFC-to-direct pathway medium spiny neuron (dMSN) circuit and the dMSNs themselves were selectively hyperactive. These hyperactive dMSNs exerted increased inhibitory control over cholinergic interneurons (CINs) in the DMS, coinciding with reduced CIN firing and diminished striatal acetylcholine (ACh) release. Critically, sustained chemogenetic inhibition of the mPFC-to-DMS circuit in 5xFAD mice reduced cortical A{beta} accumulation, normalized glutamatergic transmission in both the mPFC and DMS, restored striatal ACh levels, and rescued reversal learning deficits. Together, these findings identify a hyperactive mPFC-to-DMS circuit that disrupts corticostriatal and cholinergic signaling, contributing to cognitive inflexibility in 5xFAD mice. Targeting this circuit may offer a therapeutic strategy to preserve cognitive function in the early stages of AD.",

      "title": "Lightweight Adaptive and Recoverable Implants (LARI) for Chronic Single and Dual Neuropixels 2.0 Recordings for Naturalistic Behaviors in Feature-Rich Environments",
      "content": "Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic decision-making requires chronic, high-quality neural recordings from distributed brain regions in freely behaving animals. However, existing silicon probe implants for mice are limited by weight, fragility, lack of independent probe adjustment, and poor suitability for long-term recordings in complex environments. Here we introduce LARI-1.0 (Lightweight Adjustable and Reusable Implant) and LARI-mini, two Neuropixels 2.0 implant systems designed for stable, recoverable, and independently adjustable single- and dual-probe recordings in mice. LARI-1.0 enables independent vertical and lateral positioning of two probes, while LARI-mini provides a lighter single-probe alternative, reducing implant mass by ~20%. Fully assembled weights of ~2.3 g (LARI-1.0) and ~1.5 g (LARI-mini) remain within 10% and 7.5% of adult male mouse body weight, respectively. We validated implant performance in a custom feature-rich naturalistic foraging environment that elicited full-body movements, rapid elevation changes, and ethological foraging behaviors across fed, fasted, and high-fat diet states. Both implants exhibited excellent mechanical stability, minimal motion-related artifacts, and probe drift comparable to previous studies. High-quality single-unit activity with stable waveform features, 5-6 fold signal-to-noise ratios, and no systematic loss of well-isolated units was maintained for up to 180 days. These results demonstrate that LARI-1.0 and LARI-mini provide lightweight, durable, and customizable implant solutions enabling long-term, high-fidelity neural recordings during naturalistic behavior.",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

      "title": "NEuRT: A Transformer-Based Model for Explainable Neuronal Activity Analysis",
      "content": "The study of neuronal activity is essential for understanding brain function and its alterations in neurodegenerative diseases. Advances in in vivo imaging have enabled real-time observation of neuronal dynamics, but classical statistical methods struggle to capture the complex, time-dependent interactions within neuronal networks. Machine learning offers promising solutions for analyzing high-dimensional neuronal data, yet their application in neuroscience remains limited. Here, we introduce NEuRT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model adapted for neuronal activity analysis. NEuRT leverages self-attention mechanisms to interpret complex neuronal interactions, providing insights into patterns that traditional methods may overlook. Pre-trained on the recently introduced large annotated dataset MICrONS for signal reconstruction, NeuRT demonstrates strong generalization, effectively reconstructing activity from both visual cortex two-photon and hippocampal miniature fluorescence microscopy. Built on the BERT architecture, the NEuRT model can be efficiently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. We showcase its application in classifying wild-type and transgenic Alzheimer's disease model mice, based on hippocampal activity, revealing group-specific features through attention map analysis. By reducing reliance on extensive labeled data, addressing a critical challenge in neuroscience, NEuRT bridges fundamental neuroscience and disease research, offering a robust framework for AI-driven and explainable neuronal activity analysis.",

      "title": "Alteration of empathy-related behaviors in two strains of mice expressing mutations of the \u03b15 cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit",
      "content": "Human genetic association studies have linked a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the alpha5 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) to an increased risk of nicotine dependence, alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and schizophrenia. We used transgenic mice expressing either the SNP rs16969968 (termed 5SNP or 5KI) or a knockout of the Chrna5 gene (5KO) to investigate the role of 5-containing nAChRs (5*nAChRs) in emotion recognition and prosocial, rescuing-like behavioral tasks. We found that 5KO mice are impaired in the recognition of a negative affective state in a familiar peer, and displayed severely altered pro-social, altruistic behaviors, eventually assaulting peers in distress. In contrast, 5KI mice exhibited normal or improved emotion recognition and increased rescuing-like behavior. Importantly, effects of 5 mutations on emotion recognition were modulated by sex. These results demonstrate the critical implication of 5*nAChRs in emotion recognition and prosocial behaviors, revealing, sex-dependent patterns of these social emotional deficits in 5KI and 5KO mice. The current study also supports the view that 5KI and 5KO may provide a valuable preclinical model of Type I (female 5KI mice), and Type II (male 5KO mice) behavioral profiles of AUD.",
