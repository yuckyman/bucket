      "title": "Grey matter microstructural alterations distinguish cognitive impairment in Lewy body diseases",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION. Despite widespread cortical involvement in Lewy body diseases, conventional grey matter MRI measures have limited sensitivity. Microstructural measures from diffusion MRI may be more sensitive to early changes. METHODS. We examined grey matter microstructure in 197 participants across the Lewy body diseases spectrum: 88 Lewy body dementia (LBD), 109 Parkinson's normal cognition (PD-NC), and 46 controls. We compared tissue-weighted neurite density (tNDI), orientation dispersion index (tODI), and free water fraction (FWF) cross-sectionally and longitudinally. We examined relationships between microstructure, disease severity and plasma p-tau217. RESULTS. LBD participants showed widespread cortical and subcortical tODI and FWF increases compared to controls and PD-NC, despite minimal atrophy. These changes correlated with cognitive (but not motor severity) and with p-tau217. In 100 Parkinson's patients followed-up over 3 years, cortical FWF increased in those developing cognitive decline. DISCUSSION. Microstructural measures capture early grey matter changes, offering a sensitive marker of grey matter integrity in Lewy body diseases.",

      "title": "Reactive Astrocytes Drive Extracellular Acidification to Mediate \u03b1-Synuclein Neurodegeneration",
      "content": "Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as key players in neurodegeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they drive disease remain elusive. Here, we uncover a fundamental pathway in which reactive astrocytes fuel neurodegeneration in -synucleinopathies-including Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia-by acidifying the brain's extracellular environment. We demonstrate that both human patient tissue and a gut-to-brain -synuclein mouse model exhibit accumulation of reactive astrocytes and extracellular acidosis. Mechanistically, we show that astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis releases acidic contents, driving a drop in pH that activates neuronal acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), resulting in neuronal loss and behavioral decline. Blocking this pathway-either by inhibiting astrocytic lysosomal exocytosis or genetically or pharmacologically targeting neuronal ASIC1a-mitigates pathology and rescues neurodegenerative phenotypes in vivo. These findings provide a conceptual advance by establishing a mechanistic link between glial inflammation, acid-base homeostasis, and neuronal vulnerability, and suggest that targeting astrocyte-driven acidification or ASIC1a signaling could offer new avenues for disease modification in -synucleinopathies.",

      "title": "Disrupted dynamics of brain structure function coupling link genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease and aging to cognitive decline in 34,067 adults",
      "content": "Understanding how a stable structural connectome supports flexible cognition, especially in aging, is a fundamental question in neuroscience. While static structure function coupling (SFC) is well-studied, the dynamic decoupling of functional activity from structural constraints, dynamic SFC (DSFC), remains poorly understood. Leveraging MRI data from 34,067 UK Biobank participants (ages 45~82), we characterized the distinct roles of SFC and DSFC in aging, cognition, and health. We found that SFC and DSFC followed spatially divergent aging trajectories: SFC declined primarily in sensorimotor systems, whereas DSFC decreased most prominently in higher order networks. Both SFC and DSFC in higher-order networks were positively correlated with cognitive performance (e.g., fluid intelligence). However, the associations with mental and physical health diverged between the two measures: reduced DSFC was predominantly linked to health burdens in high-order default/limbic networks, whereas weakened SFC was primarily associated with health burdens in low-order sensory-motor networks. Genetic analyses revealed that Alzheimer's risk, specifically APOE4 dosage, significantly reduced DSFC in higher-order cognitive networks and SFC in visual cortex. Mediation analyses further demonstrated that aging and APOE4-linked cognitive decline were mediated via visual SFC and ventral attention DSFC. These findings position static and dynamic coupling as complementary mechanisms: static SFC preserves network robustness, while dynamic SFC enables transient reconfiguration for complex integration. Together, our results highlight these dual mechanisms as crucial for maintaining cognitive flexibility, providing potential biomarkers for age-related neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Maximum entropy model reveals frequent brain state switching in psychotic disorders in a multiversal brain function analysis",
      "content": "Background: Regional activation and pairwise correlation are mainstay neuroimaging methods. Yet, neither approach fully captures how brain networks evolve and interact over time. The maximum entropy model (MEM), which integrates regional and inter-regional activity, represents a promising integrative approach to examine dynamically evolving functional networks. Methods: Activation-only, pairwise-coactivation-only analyses and an MEM framework were applied to the Human Connectome Project-Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset (109 patients, 56 controls). Using the 360-node HCP/Glasser atlas to define brain regions from the default mode (DMN) and dorsal attention (DAN) networks, group differences were quantified in nodal frequency band power, functional connectivity (FC), and MEM features such as transition rates between basins in energy landscapes and their associations with cognitive and psychopathological measures were examined. Results: Psychosis was associated with reduced first-order BOLD frequency band power and FC graph metrics. Findings specific to the MEM demonstrated a wider variety of DMN and DAN activation/deactivation patterns, with more frequent switching between them during the resting state in psychosis. Network configuration differences were more pronounced in sub-systems comprised of both DMN and DAN nodes. While BOLD frequency band power of a few regions correlated with working memory, none of the graph metrics correlated. However, basins transitions and energy correlated negatively with working memory. Conclusion: MEM provides unique information unavailable from other analyses. Results converge among first-order-only, second-order-only, and MEM analyses, suggesting attenuated inter-network connectivity with less stability of DMN and DAN brain states in psychosis. Such changes may underlie cognitive impairments, specifically basin transitions rates in psychosis.",

      "title": "Computational modeling and preclinical validation support targeting somatic instability for Huntington's disease treatment",
      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat within the huntingtin (HTT) gene. Genetic modifiers of disease onset and progression in HD implicate somatic instability (SI) of the expanded CAG repeat as a key pathogenic driver, with MSH3 emerging as a leading therapeutic target. Reducing SI, particularly in the most affected neuronal cell type, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum, is thus a rational therapeutic strategy for HD. To inform the development of an SI-targeted therapy, we generated a computational model simulating SI in MSNs to infer therapeutic effects on MSN survival resulting from an intervention that reduces SI. The model takes advantage of HD patient data to predict therapeutic benefit across a range of inherited CAG lengths and ages of intervention, considering the degree of target engagement regionally and per cell. To target SI experimentally, we designed an artificial microRNA to lower MSH3 mRNA (miMSH3) after delivery with AAV-DB-3, a previously described MSN-targeting AAV capsid variant. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 achieved from 48 to 94% MSH3 mRNA reduction in MSNs of nonhuman primates (NHPs), which, when modeled, would reduce the composite Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale change over baseline from 50 to over 120% as well as delay motor symptom onset by many years. AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 also showed robust target engagement in vivo with up to 46% reduction in SI in HdhQ111 mice. The integration of preclinical experimental data and the computational model support the translational potential of AAV-DB-3.miMSH3 as a disease modifying therapy applicable for HD patients with a broad range of inherited repeat lengths.",

      "title": "Alcohol Use Disorder Affects Brain Metals",
      "content": "Background: One of the risks associated with alcohol use disorder (AUD) is dementia. While the exact pathology is unknown, there is increasing evidence that alcohol consumption may dysregulate iron homeostasis in the brain leading to increased brain iron concentrations. Unregulated iron can produce oxidative stress and cellular damage to neurons. Iron-related cellular death is a relatively new finding and is called ferroptosis. To test the hypothesis that alcohol use disorder may cause brain iron dysregulation, we measured iron in hippocampus, caudate and substantia nigra in brain tissues obtained from individuals diagnosed with (AUD) and from individuals with no apparent alcoholrelated problems. Methods: We obtained hippocampus, caudate, and substantia nigra tissues from the New South Wales Brain Tissue Resource Centre, University of Sydney. The tissues came from 20 males and 20 females, half of each diagnosed with AUD. The tissues were wet-ashed and prepared for analysis of iron, copper, and zinc by total x-ray reflectance fluorescence. Results: In the hippocampus, we observed AUD-related decreased iron, but nothing more. In the substantia nigra, we observed a significant increase in iron and a trend toward an in increase in copper content in females and decreased iron and zinc in males. In the caudate we saw a near doubling of iron in females and a significant increase in copper in females and males. Conclusions: These results provide direct evidence that at least part of AUD-related pathophysiology involves the dysregulation of trace metals in the brain. These changes are more severe in females, which may relate to extended levels of exposure due to slower alcohol metabolism.",

      "title": "High performance sorting of motor unit action potentials with EMUsort",
      "content": "Understanding how neural signals control muscle activity during behavior is a key challenge in motor neuroscience. To this end, recent advances in intramuscular multielectrode arrays have enabled high-quality multichannel recordings of many motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in freely moving subjects. However, identifying individual MUAP events within multichannel recordings is a significant challenge for existing spike sorting methods, which are typically optimized for identifying action potentials from neurons in the brain. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Enhanced Motor Unit sorter (EMUsort), an extension of Kilosort4 (KS4) that achieves high-performance MUAP spike sorting. We applied EMUsort to high-resolution intramuscular recordings from rat forelimb during locomotion and monkey forelimb during a reaching task. EMUsort improves upon prior methods by addressing key challenges encountered with MUAP datasets, including: 1) long time delays across electrodes due to propagation along muscle fibers, 2) more complex waveform shapes compared to neuronal action potentials, and 3) a high degree of MUAP overlap due to cumulative motor unit recruitment. We compared EMUsort to existing spike sorting methods quantitatively using simulated datasets that closely emulated the rat and monkey datasets we recorded. EMUsort provided median error rate reductions of 67.5% and 49.9% during periods of high motor unit activation for the rat and monkey datasets, respectively. In sum, EMUsort provides a substantial improvement to MUAP spike sorter accuracy, especially during regions of high MUAP overlap, in an easy-to-use software package.",

      "content": "<p>I'm not super experienced with cryptography but I had some spare time on my hands so I decided to make CubeAuthn and turn it into a paper.<p>Repo here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Acorn221/CubeAuthn\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Acorn221/CubeAuthn</a>. Feel free to ask questions!<p>---<p>Abstract:<p>We present a novel authentication system that transforms a Rubik's cube into a physical key for digital authentication. By reading the cube's specific arrangement among 43 quintillion possible configurations, our system generates FIDO2-compatible credentials on-demand. Unlike traditional security tokens that store credentials, the cube itself becomes part of the key with its physical state forming a deterministic seed for keypair generation. Our proof-of-concept, CubeAuthn, demonstrates this concept with a browser extension that authenticates users on WebAuthn-enabled sites using the cube's physical state as the cryptographic seed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46533315\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46533315</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

      "title": "Show HN: An LLM response cache that's aware of dynamic data",
      "content": "<p>Raymond here from Butter.dev, an LLM response cache built as a chat-completions proxy. Today we're launching a key feature for the platform: the ability to generalize on dynamic, templated inputs.<p>Caching at the HTTP request level has the obvious problem of generalizability. Nearly no request is identical, due to templated variables (like names) and metadata (like timestamps), so exact-match cache lookups rarely hit. We solve this at Butter by using LLMs to detect dynamic content in requests and derive their inter-relationships, allowing the cache entry to be stored as a template + variables + deterministic code. This allows future requests to contain different variable data, yet still serve from cache.<p>We've found this approach greatly improves cache hit rate, and believe it could be useful for agents performing repetitive back-office tasks, computer use, or data transformations where input data is frequently of the same shape.<p>- You can see a demo of learning patterns here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORDfPnk9rCA</a><p>- We wrote more about the technical approach here: <a href=\"https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-response-caching\">https://blog.butter.dev/on-automatic-template-induction-for-...</a><p>- It's free to try out here: <a href=\"https://butter.dev/auth\">https://butter.dev/auth</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532755</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
