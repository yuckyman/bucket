      "title": "Effectiveness of a teletherapy-based phonological short-term memory training in reducing phonological impairments in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia: a multiple case study",
      "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",

      "title": "Influence of electrode placement on the recognition of different gesture categories using high-density sEMG",
      "content": "High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG)-based gesture recognition serves as a critical interface for human-computer interaction (HCI). However, recognition accuracy exhibits a significant dependency on gesture complexity and electrode positioning. To address this, we systematically investigated the relationship between gesture types and sEMG electrode placement locations through intra-subject, inter-day, and inter-subject validation protocols. Two distinct gesture categories were analyzed, i.e., single-degree-of-freedom (single-DoF) gestures and daily-used multi-finger synergistic gestures. Using an open-access gesture dataset, HD-sEMG signals were acquired from three forearm regions: the distal wrist, mid-forearm, and proximal elbow, separately. Classification results using support vector machine (SVM) revealed that single-DoF gestures achieved peak accuracy with distal wrist signals (98.63% for intra-subject, 79.73% for inter-day, and 75.47% for inter-subject validation protocols), whereas daily-used gestures performed optimally with signals from the mid-forearm and proximal elbow regions. These findings demonstrate the specific relationship between electrode placement and gesture type, providing valuable insights for EMG-HCI design and sensor placement strategies based on the nature of the target gesture.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.
