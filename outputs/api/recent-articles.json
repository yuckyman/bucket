      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "content": "Gentleness, defined as the ability to handle tissues delicately and minimize unnecessary force, is a key indicator of surgical proficiency. Objective and real-time assessment of gentleness in virtual reality (VR)-based training can enhance the understanding of both psychomotor and cognitive aspects of surgical skill. This study evaluates and classifies participants gentleness during VR-based surgical simulations using fNIRS-derived hemodynamic features. We trained and compared several machine learning models to assess performance. Twenty-three volunteers with no prior laparoscopic experience performed a virtual reality-based laparoscopic double-grasper task while hemodynamic activity over frontal and motor cortical areas was recorded using eighteen fNIRS channels. Alongside fNIRS, we collected subjective workload (NASA-TLX), error numbers, and a VR gentleness score. This task involves using two grasper tools simultaneously to perform the tissue like balloon manipulation in a VR environment. We extracted temporal features (slope, RMS, standard deviation) and trained machine learning models to classify performance levels based on cortical activation. Labels were binarized as low vs. high using median splits for the gentleness score. Models were evaluated with stratified 5-fold cross-validation and summarized by accuracy. Results showed stronger right-frontal HbO activity and increased left-motor HbR responses in the low-performance group, suggesting greater cognitive effort and less efficient motor strategies during VR-based laparoscopic manipulation. Across classifiers and feature sets, slope-based features consistently outperformed variability- and amplitude-based metrics. Among the tested models, HbR slope features achieved the best overall classification performance, with the highest accuracy obtained using K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest classifiers (accuracy {approx} 0.89, AUC up to 0.97). These findings demonstrate that fNIRS-derived hemodynamic dynamics can reliably discriminate between high and low VR performance levels, supporting their potential use in automated performance assessment and neuroadaptive feedback frameworks for VR-based surgical training.",

      "content": "Visual working memory (VWM) is traditionally studied while constraining eye movements and limiting access to visual input, yet in natural vision humans constantly explore and resample their environment. Only a few studies have examined VWM utilization when participants were allowed to interact with the environment and found that participants often preferred to resample their environment rather than rely on VWM storage. However, since eye movements were not controlled in these studies, the link between VWM utilization and free visual exploration remained unknown. In two experiments (N = 40), we investigated how visual exploration shapes reliance on VWM versus perceptual input. Participants searched for a common target across two item sets and could either store multiple items for comparison or repeatedly resample the sets by switching between them. Results revealed that when switching was achieved through eye movements, participants consistently relied more on visual resampling and less on VWM; in contrast, when switching required a manual response, they shifted toward greater VWM use. This pattern persisted even when peripheral input was equated, suggesting that natural exploration through eye movements reduces the cognitive cost of acquiring visual information, leading to a strategic reduction in VWM use. Our findings challenge fixation-based approaches to VWM research and highlight the importance of studying cognition under ecological viewing conditions.",

This study aims to explore the mechanisms underlying gender perception in individuals undergoing emergency medical treatment, employing an innovative digital pareidolia assessment to evaluate gender perception within the context of face pareidolia.MethodsFifty adult patients treated by a female physician in the green triage zone participated in the study. Target images consisted of face pareidolia images, while non-target images were scrambled. All images were standardized for size, tone, and light intensity. Patients instructed the pareidolia images and were asked if they discerned a face; if they answered \u2018No,\u2019 the next image was shown. If they saw a face, they identified the associated gender. Their responses and reaction times were systematically recorded digitally.ResultsOur findings revealed that, regardless of wait times, patients were significantly more likely to identify pareidolia faces as male rather than female, especially after being examined by a female physician. Additionally, male patients exhibited slightly longer reaction times than females when responding to pareidolia images.ConclusionThe outcomes of this investigation provide critical insights into the influence of pareidolia on gender perception of faces in the emergency department setting. It underscores the notion that gender biases, which arise from both biological and sociocultural factors, can affect the dynamics of patient-physician interactions.",

      "title": "A method for measuring first glymphatic influx of a cerebrospinal fluid tracer in the human brain",
      "content": "IntroductionThe glymphatic system is a brain-wide perivascular transport route for fluids and solutes in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serves as a conduit for solute transport and clearance of brain waste. Intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where the intrathecal contrast agent serves as a CSF tracer, has been developed to measure glymphatic function in humans. The normalized MRI T1 signal is a semiquantitative measure of CSF flow and exchange with the brain. Objective: To estimate first-time tracer appearance within brain tissue after intrathecal tracer injection.MethodsThis study implemented segmented regression analysis to estimate the first-time tracer appearance of an intrathecal tracer within brain tissues. An increase (breakpoint) in the normalized MRI T1 signal was defined to represent first glymphatic influx of the tracer. The study included 30 reference (REF) subjects with no identified CSF disturbance and 15 patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). We developed and evaluated the method in REF subjects and further compared it between the two study groups.ResultsThe time to initial glymphatic tracer enrichment in the REF cohort was approximately 1\u202fh in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cerebral cortex and ranged from two to 4\u202fh in the corresponding white matter regions. In subcortical limbic structures and basal ganglia structures, it was 0.6 and 2.2\u202fh, respectively. Compared with REF subjects, IIH patients presented a non-significant mean difference in the first appearance of \u00b10.5\u202fh in the cerebral cortex and white matter regions, with somewhat longer estimated delays in the parietal and insular white matter regions. The results are presented as time series plots and estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Additionally, we provide supplementary R code, which can be adapted for use in future studies, and outline a basic assessment of true versus estimated breakpoints using simulated data.ConclusionSegmented regression was found feasible to quantify the time to first glymphatic enrichment, i.e., increase in the normalized MRI T1 signal. Moreover, the method seems reasonable to differentiate first glymphatic influx between the cohorts.",

      "title": "Continuous affect responses to a large diverse set of unfamiliar music: Bayesian time-series and cluster analyses.",
      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.
