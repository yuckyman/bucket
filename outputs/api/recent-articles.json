      "title": "Extinction and reinstatement sex-dependently affect freezing behavior, pain perception, locomotion, and rearing behavior in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",
      "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

      "title": "Chemogenetic modulation of PAC1-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) alters anxiety-related behaviors in male mice.",
      "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

      "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

      "title": "Paraventricular thalamic inputs to the ventral pallidum shape reward seeking during threat and fear responding in extinction.",
      "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

      "title": "Patterns of prefrontal cortical activity associated with attention-demanding and motor aspects of dual-task walking as measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.",
      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.
