      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

      "title": "Neuromodulation for Tourette syndrome: current techniques and future perspectives",
      "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",

      "title": "cuBNM: GPU-Accelerated Brain Network Modeling",
      "content": "Brain network modeling uses computer simulations to infer about latent neural properties at micro- and mesoscales by fitting brain dynamic models to empirical data of individual subjects or groups. However, computational costs of (individualized) model fitting is a major bottleneck, limiting the practical feasibility of this approach to larger cohorts and more complex models, and highlighting the need for scalable simulation implementations. Here, we introduce cuBNM, a Python package which leverages parallel processing of graphics processing units to massively accelerate simulations of brain network models. We show running simulations on graphics processing units is several hundred times faster compared to central processing units. We demonstrate the usage of cuBNM by running optimization of group-level and individualized low- and high-dimensional models. As examples of the utility of individualized models, we investigated test-retest reliability and heritability of simulated and empirical measures in the Human Connectome Project dataset, and found simulated features to be fairly reliable and heritable. Overall, cuBNM provides an efficient framework for large-scale simulations of brain network models, facilitating investigations of latent neural processes across larger cohorts, denser networks, and higher-dimensional models, which were previously less feasible in practice.",

      "content": "Accurate targeting of specific brain regions through non-invasive methods has long been a major goal of basic and translational neuroscience. Systemic delivery of AAVs expressing highly region- and cell-type-specific regulatory elements (enhancer-AAVs) continues to emerge as a tractable solution. Here we performed an independent characterization of a novel enhancer element with apparent robust transgene expression in fast-spiking basket cell interneurons in mouse hippocampus. Surprisingly, this vector did not induce expression in other brain regions harboring the same neuron class. Following intravenous administration in mice, robust labeling of FS-BCs across all hippocampal subfields was observed. We validated the FS-BC specificity in hippocampus using immunofluorescence and electrophysiological recordings. Viral labeling was confined to parvalbumin-positive cells exhibiting basket cell morphology and fast-spiking responses. This approach represents a promising avenue for both mechanistic investigation of hippocampal circuit function and potential therapeutic interventions targeting hippocampal pathophysiologies such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders in mice and potentially other species.",

      "content": "The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a central large-scale brain network implicated in a range of cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Studying the DMN's complex dynamics in animal models provides invaluable insights into its function in both healthy and pathological states. However, performing a stable, long-term, and large-scale electrophysiological recordings from the multiple, deep, and distributed nodes of the DMN in awake, behaving mice has been a significant challenge. Here, we present a novel, two-phase surgical protocol developed to create a large (4x7.6 mm), durable, and resealable cranial window in mice. The procedure is designed to preserve the integrity of the dura mater, which is paramount for long-term brain health and recording stability. This window facilitates repeated, longitudinal recordings from over 1,000 electrodes simultaneously by combining surface-level micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) with two high-density intracranial electrode probes, allowing unprecedented access to the DMN. This technique provides a robust platform for multi-modal, multi-scale interrogation of network-wide electrophysiological dynamics over several weeks, opening new avenues for investigating the neuroplastic changes underlying the pathophysiology of brain disorders and for evaluating the chronic effects of novel therapeutics.",

      "content": "Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) triggers brain injury and systemic changes, including gut dysbiosis, intestinal barrier dysfunction (IBD), and bacterial translocation (BT). Although larger infarcts are associated with higher infection risk, it is unclear whether lesion size directly influences gut barrier integrity or bacterial dissemination. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) proximally or distally to generate large or small infarcts. Seventy two hours post ischemia, infarct volume was measured by MRI, and BT was assessed in mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and lungs. ZO1 and MMP9 expression were used to evaluate intestinal barrier integrity. Peripheral and central inflammation were assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Results: Proximal MCAO produced larger infarcts than distal MCAO. The proportion of animals exhibiting BT was lower in distal MCAO, but this difference was not statistically significant. ZO1 expression did not differ between groups, while MMP9 was increased only in animals with BT, independent of infarct size. BT was associated with more pronounced lymphopenia and enhanced microglial activation and T cell infiltration in the brain. The composition of translocated bacteria was similar across groups. Conclusions: Infarct size alone does not determine IBD or BT, although BT is linked to intestinal and cerebral inflammation. This study evaluates for the first time the effect of lesion magnitude on IBD and BT, highlighting the complex interplay between cerebral injury and gut systemic interactions.",
