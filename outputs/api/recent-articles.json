      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

      "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Kai Wang, one of the creators of Yuanzai World.<p>We built a simulation engine (currently on iOS & Android) that allows the community to create and share text adventures populated by multiple LLM-based agents. Unlike standard chatbots, our focus is on community co-creation\u2014users define the worldviews, and our agents (with persistent memory and social relationships) bring them to life.<p>The cool part:<p>We implemented a system we call \"World-Line Divergence\" (inspired by visual novels like Steins;Gate). Usually, AI RPGs feel random or infinite loop. We built a state machine that tracks \"World Deviation.\" If players interact with NPCs in specific ways (e.g., convincing an artist to change their style), it triggers a graph switch, leading to a completely different generated ending, effectively breaking the original script.<p>Tech Stack:<p>- Backend: Python / Java with a custom AI orchestration framework (to handle agent concurrency).<p>- Models: Hybrid routing between Gemini, GPT, and DeepSeek (optimizing for cost/performance based on task).<p>- Vector DB: Milvus (for handling long-term agent memory).<p>We are currently live on App Store and Google Play. Since it's a mobile-first experience, the link leads to our landing page where you can see the demo flow.<p>Would love to hear your feedback on the \"World-Line\" concept: Does this state-machine approach solve the aimlessness of AI RPGs?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565265\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565265</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
