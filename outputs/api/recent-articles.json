      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Altering visual feedback during reaching: no mitigating effect on pain for individuals with complex regional pain syndrome, but visuomotor adaptation is preserved",
      "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

      "title": "Identification of cognitive predictors of remission in depression following limited effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hot and cold cognitive systems",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

      "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
      "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

      "title": "Simulated auditory nerve response evoked by lateral-wall and peri-modiolar electrode arrays inserted in scala tympani or scala vestibuli",
      "content": "IntroductionCochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices designed to restore hearing in individuals with severe to profound hearing loss. Clinically, CI electrode arrays differ by location, either peri-modiolar (pm) positioned near the cochlear axis, or lateral-wall (lw), placed closer to the peripheral terminals of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). Standard insertion is into the scala tympani (ST), though the scala vestibuli (SV) is considered for cases of severe ST ossification.MethodsThis computational study investigates the neural responses of both healthy and degenerated ANFs to monopolar stimulation from electrode arrays at different locations. Using a 3D finite element model of the human cochlea, we evaluated threshold excitations for short monophasic pulses across 25 traced ANF pathways. Four array configurations were compared (pmST, pmSV, lwST, lwSV), each with electrodes directly targeting the traced fibers.ResultsResults show that excitation thresholds and stimulation specificity depend on both neural health and array position. Specificity, defined by minimizing off-target fiber stimulation, was highest for healthy ANFs with lwSV, followed by pmST, lwST, and pmSV, influenced by electrode orientation. Simulated ST ossification, modeled as decreased conductivity, generally led to reduced cathodic thresholds, suggesting that ST insertion may still be advantageous even with developing or partial ossification.DiscussionThe pmST array consistently offered reliable outcomes across varying electrode configuration and neural conditions. These findings support considering SV insertion when ST is obstructed and highlight factors influencing CI performance based on array location and neural status.",
