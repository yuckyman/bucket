      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "Effects of comprehensive group music therapy on affect and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia undergoing community-based rehabilitation: a preliminary study",
      "content": "Background and objectiveMost individuals with schizophrenia reside in the community, where they frequently encounter difficulties related to emotional problems and social functioning\u2013 critical areas of concern in the rehabilitation process. This study aims to investigate the effects of a comprehensive group music therapy intervention on the emotional state and social functioning of individuals with schizophrenia undergoing community rehabilitation.MethodsA total of 28 individuals with schizophrenia in community rehabilitation were randomly assigned to either the music intervention group (n = 14) or the control group (n = 14). The music intervention group participated in an 8-week comprehensive group music therapy intervention, while the control group continued with routine family life. The music therapy program was culturally adapted to the local community context, incorporating familiar regional music and dialect. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) served as the primary outcome to assess affective changes, and the Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) served as the secondary outcome to evaluate social functioning. Both measures were administered pre- and post-intervention. In addition, some participants in the intervention group completed semi-structured interviews to explore changes in social functioning and affect.ResultsFollowing the intervention, the music therapy group showed significant improvements in positive affect, social activities and self-care, as measured by the PANAS and SDSS, respectively. In contrast, no significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group. Semi-structured interviews further supported these findings, with participants in the intervention group reporting enhanced emotional state and improved social functioning.ConclusionComprehensive group music therapy appears to be an effective intervention for improving emotional states and social functioning in individuals with schizophrenia engaged in community rehabilitation. This culturally adapted intervention model demonstrates its potential for broader application.",

      "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid proteomic profiling reveals potential biomarkers and altered pathways in myotonic dystrophy type 1",
      "content": "IntroductionMyotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy, affects not only motor function and muscle integrity but also leads to debilitating cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and multisystem complications. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is increasingly recognized, manifesting as impairments in working memory, executive function, sleep regulation, and mood and behavior. These interrelated, multisystemic features contribute to multifaceted symptoms that significantly reduce quality of life for patients and their families. To identify potential biomarkers of CNS disease activity in DM1, we performed the first exploratory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiling study.MethodsCSF samples from patients with DM1 (n\u202f= 11) and healthy controls (n\u202f= 5) were analyzed using Olink monoclonal antibody panels, quantifying 1,072 proteins. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression identified proteins discriminating between DM1 and controls. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Reactome database to assess biological significance.ResultsSix candidate biomarker proteins were differentially expressed between between DM1 patients and controls: CKAP4, SCARF1, NCAM1, CD59, PTH1R, and CA4. LASSO analysis further identified 15 proteins discriminating DM1 and controls, implicating pathways related to neuronal health, neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, motor control, neuromuscular junction integrity, and cytoskeletal regulation. Dysregulated pathways included IGF transport, MAPK signaling, NCAM signaling, and broader signal transduction cascades pathways also implicated in other neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuromuscular disorders.DiscussionThis first exploratory CSF proteomic analysis in DM1 identified dysregulated protein networks that may underlie CNS dysfunction in this multisystemic disease. These findings provide novel insights into DM1 pathophysiology and support the potential of CSF proteomic signatures as candidate diagnostic tools, indicators of disease activity, and measures of therapeutic response, pending validation in larger, independent cohorts.",

      "title": "An alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist induces retinal neurogenesis and restores electrophysiological function following blast-induced ocular trauma in adult mice",
      "content": "IntroductionBlast-induced ocular trauma is a major cause of vision loss in both civilian and military populations and effective treatments are limited by the adult mammalian retina\u2019s inability to regenerate neurons lost to injury or aging. This study evaluated the neurogenic potential of PNU-282987, an alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, in an adult mouse model of blast-induced retinal trauma. We tested whether a delayed treatment paradigm, initiated after substantial neuronal loss occurred, could induce neurogenesis and restore retinal function.MethodsAdult mice received a single blast exposure, resulting in a significant reduction in cell counts across all retinal layers and decreased electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes. One month after injury, when neuronal loss was fully established, daily eye drops of PNU- 282987 were administered for two weeks. Neurogenesis and cellular proliferation were assessed using BrdU incorporation and co-labeling with retinal ganglion cell and photoreceptor markers. Retinal function was evaluated with ERG recordings, and cell counts in treated retinas were compared with untreated blasted eyes and uninjured controls.ResultsDelayed PNU-282987 treatment induced robust cellular proliferation and neurogenesis throughout the retina. Treated retinas showed significantly increased retinal ganglion cell and photoreceptor counts compared with untreated blast-injured eyes, reaching levels not significantly different from control retinas. Electrophysiological analysis revealed a significant recovery of ERG amplitudes, returning to baseline levels in most cases.Discussion/ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that PNU-282987-induced neurogenesis is sufficient to restore retinal structure and function even when treatment is initiated one month after blast injury. This work establishes a promising novel therapeutic approach for treating retinal trauma in adults.",

      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "content": "Sixty-nine participants made continuous response judgments of perceived arousal and valence while listening to 30-s extracts of 100 unfamiliar pieces within a novel recommender system. Our purpose was to take advantage of the relatively large number of participants and pieces studied (compared with prior work on time series analysis [TSA] of continuous affective responses to music) to test the generality of the deductions made from prior evidence in smaller studies. Accordingly, we expected highly autoregressive responses, and hypothesized that acoustic intensity fluctuation would be a major (population-wide, fixed-effect) predictor of arousal and to a lesser degree valence responses in multivariate models, operating in conjunction with broad features of the spectral profile of the music (such as spectral flatness and centroid). We expected considerable interparticipant variability and were interested in the degree to which there was also interpiece variability (both being features of group-specific, random effects). The basic expectations were supported, and we also demonstrated, partly by means of a novel use of cluster analysis, that the observed group variabilities in response features could not be readily attributed to indices of a range of participant-preference and piece-feature characteristics, determined prior to the experiments. A Bayesian analysis was developed, possibly for the first time in the TSA of continuous affect responses to music, since it provides a more comprehensive description of the parameters of the analysis (not only their best estimate point values) and their effects, and a comprehensive range of tests for meaningful effects.

      "title": "KOM: A Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence System for Precision Management of Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA)",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.19798v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) affects more than 600 million individuals globally and is associated with significant pain, functional impairment, and disability. While personalized multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to slow disease progression and enhance quality of life, they typically require substantial medical resources and expertise, making them difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. To address this challenge, we developed KOM, a multi-agent system designed to automate KOA evaluation, risk prediction, and treatment prescription. This system assists clinicians in performing essential tasks across the KOA care pathway and supports the generation of tailored management plans based on individual patient profiles, disease status, risk factors, and contraindications. In benchmark experiments, KOM demonstrated superior performance compared to several general-purpose large language models in imaging analysis and prescription generation. A randomized three-arm simulation study further revealed that collaboration between KOM and clinicians reduced total diagnostic and planning time by 38.5% and resulted in improved treatment quality compared to each approach used independently. These findings indicate that KOM could help facilitate automated KOA management and, when integrated into clinical workflows, has the potential to enhance care efficiency. The modular architecture of KOM may also offer valuable insights for developing AI-assisted management systems for other chronic conditions.",

      "title": "IndEgo: A Dataset of Industrial Scenarios and Collaborative Work for Egocentric Assistants",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.19684v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We introduce IndEgo, a multimodal egocentric and exocentric dataset addressing common industrial tasks, including assembly/disassembly, logistics and organisation, inspection and repair, woodworking, and others. The dataset contains 3,460 egocentric recordings (approximately 197 hours), along with 1,092 exocentric recordings (approximately 97 hours). A key focus of the dataset is collaborative work, where two workers jointly perform cognitively and physically intensive tasks. The egocentric recordings include rich multimodal data and added context via eye gaze, narration, sound, motion, and others. We provide detailed annotations (actions, summaries, mistake annotations, narrations), metadata, processed outputs (eye gaze, hand pose, semi-dense point cloud), and benchmarks on procedural and non-procedural task understanding, Mistake Detection, and reasoning-based Question Answering. Baseline evaluations for Mistake Detection, Question Answering and collaborative task understanding show that the dataset presents a challenge for the state-of-the-art multimodal models.

      "title": "Towards Synergistic Teacher-AI Interactions with Generative Artificial Intelligence",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.19580v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is increasingly used in education, posing significant challenges for teachers adapting to these changes. GenAI offers unprecedented opportunities for accessibility, scalability and productivity in educational tasks. However, the automation of teaching tasks through GenAI raises concerns about reduced teacher agency, potential cognitive atrophy, and the broader deprofessionalisation of teaching. Drawing findings from prior literature on AI in Education, and refining through a recent systematic literature review, this chapter presents a conceptualisation of five levels of teacher-AI teaming: transactional, situational, operational, praxical and synergistic teaming. The framework aims to capture the nuanced dynamics of teacher-AI interactions, particularly with GenAI, that may lead to the replacement, complementarity, or augmentation of teachers' competences and professional practice. GenAI technological affordances required in supporting teaming, along with empirical studies, are discussed. Drawing on empirical observations, we outline a future vision that moves beyond individual teacher agency toward collaborative decision-making between teachers and AI, in which both agents engage in negotiation, constructive challenge, and co-reasoning that enhance each other's capabilities and enable outcomes neither could realise independently. Further discussion of socio-technical factors beyond teacher-AI teaming is also included to streamline the synergy of teachers and AI in education ethically and practically.",

      "title": "Using Wearable Devices to Improve Chronic PainTreatment among Patients with Opioid Use Disorder",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.19577v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD) are common and interrelated chronic medical conditions. Currently, there is a paucity of evidence-based integrated treatments for CP and OUD among individuals receiving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Wearable devices have the potential to monitor complex patient information and inform treatment development for persons with OUD and CP, including pain variability (e.g., exacerbations of pain or pain spikes) and clinical correlates (e.g., perceived stress). However, the application of large language models (LLMs) with wearable data for understanding pain spikes, remains unexplored. Consequently, the aim of this pilot study was to examine the clinical correlates of pain spikes using a range of AI approaches. We found that machine learning models achieved relatively high accuracy (>0.7) in predicting pain spikes, while LLMs were limited in providing insights on pain spikes. Real-time monitoring through wearable devices, combined with advanced AI models, could facilitate early detection of pain spikes and support personalized interventions that may help mitigate the risk of opioid relapse, improve adherence to MOUD, and enhance the integration of CP and OUD care. Given overall limited LLM performance, these findings highlight the need to develop LLMs which can provide actionable insights in the OUD/CP context.",
