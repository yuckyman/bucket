      "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
      "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",

      "title": "Inter-ictal spike rates are not modulated by anti-seizure medication taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit: a tale of two confounders *",
      "content": "Objective. New implantable and wearable devices hold great promise to help patients manage their seizure disorders. One proposed application is measuring the rate of interictal epileptiform discharges as a biomarker of medication levels and seizure risk. This study aims to determine whether interictal epileptiform spike rates (spikes) are independently associated with anti-seizure medication (ASM) levels and evaluate whether spike rates are a reliable biomarker for ASM levels. Approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 69 patients with drug resistant epilepsy undergoing intracranial EEG monitoring during ASM taper in the epilepsy monitoring unit. An automated spike detection algorithm, validated seizure annotations, and a model of ASM load were used to assess the relationship between spike rates, ASM level, state of consciousness, and seizure timing using linear mixed effects models. Event related analysis and seasonal autoregressive models were applied to evaluate both short-term and longer-term effects of ASMs on spike rates, respectively. Main Results. Spike rates were found to increase following seizures, during sleep, and in patients experiencing early seizures, with no significant association between ASM load and spike rates after controlling for these confounders. Initial models without controls showed a positive association between ASM load and spike rates. However, this relationship disappeared when the effects of sleep and seizures were accounted for. Medication-specific analysis revealed that only levetiracetam showed a significant impact on spike rates during taper. Significance. This study demonstrates that interictal spike rates are more strongly influenced by seizure activity and sleep than by ASM levels, suggesting limited utility of spike rates as a biomarker for ASM load. However, spikes may still serve as important markers for seizure control and disease severity.",

      "title": "Neuralace: manufacture, parylene-C coating, and mechanical properties",
      "content": "Objective. This study investigates the mechanical properties of the Neuralace, a novel ultra-thin, high-channel-count mesh-type subdural electrode array, to characterize its mechanical compatibility with neural tissue (i.e., the forces exerted onto the brain upon conformation) for chronic brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) applications. Approach. A full-factorial design of experiments was used to assess the effects of geometrical variations, orientation, and polymeric encapsulation on the stiffness of silicon-based Neuralace structures. A custom low-force four-point bending setup was developed to measure flexural stiffness in a physiologically relevant displacement range. Main results. The stiffness values of Neuralace structures ranged from 2.99 N m\u22121 to 7.21 N m\u22121, depending on the cell-wall thickness (CWT) of the lace, orientation, and parylene-C (PPXC) encapsulation. Orientation and CWT had the largest impact on the stiffness of the structures, while the effects of PPXC encapsulation were statistically significant but more subtle. The stiffest Neuralace configuration is expected to exert forces approximately 10\u2013100 times lower than commercially available subdural implants would when conforming to the brain\u2019s topology (considering a 60 mm radius of the gyrus). Significance. Subdural electrode arrays have traditionally been used for epilepsy monitoring and surgical planning. These arrays are now transitioning from short-term implantation in epilepsy monitoring to long-term use in BCIs, which requires consideration of the foreign body response to ensure long-term durability and functionality. Biocompatibility challenges, such as fibrotic encapsulation and reactive astrogliosis, highlight the need for conformal subdural implant designs that minimize mechanical stress on neural tissue. This study establishes a rigorous and reproducible framework for mechanical characterization of conformable neural implants and demonstrates the feasibility of tuning design parameters to reduce implant-induced mechanical stress on cortical tissue. The results support future development of chronic BCI-compatible subdural electrodes with improved biocompatibility through mechanical design.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",
