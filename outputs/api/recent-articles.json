      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "DYRK1A in the physiology and pathology of the neuron-astrocyte axis",
      "content": "Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a dosage-sensitive kinase with critical roles in the neuron-astrocyte axis. During brain development, DYRK1A ensures the proper number of differentiated neurons and astrocytes. In neurons, this DYRK1A regulates neuronal morphogenesis and synaptic transmission. However, its functions in astrocytes are not yet well defined, with limited evidence indicating roles in astrocyte reactivity and excitotoxicity. Due to trisomy 21, DYRK1A is overexpressed in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). This imbalance directly contributes to neuronal death and likely astrocyte pathology, accelerating the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) in this population. Notably, DYRK1A overexpression also correlates with neurodegeneration and AD progression in elderly euploid adults. This correlation positions DYRK1A as a potential bridge between DS and AD, mechanistically connecting gene overdosage and neuropathology in both conditions. However, research on DYRK1A pathophysiology has primarily centered on neurons, leaving astrocytes largely understudied. Considering the vital neuroprotective functions of astrocytes, broadening DYRK1A research to encompass these cells presents an opportunity to uncover novel mechanisms contributing to the neurodegenerative process in AD. In this review, we highlight the physiology and pathology of DYRK1A in the neuron\u2013astrocyte axis, analyzing its roles in neurons and positing hypothetical functions in astrocytes, with particular emphasis on the contribution of DYRK1A\u2019s cell-specific overexpression to neurodegeneration and AD progression.",

      "title": "Identification of modulated whole-brain dynamical models from nonstationary electrophysiological data",
      "content": "Objective. Understanding the mechanisms underlying brain dynamics is a long-held goal in neuroscience. However, these dynamics are both individualized and nonstationary, making modeling challenging. Here, we present a data-driven approach to modeling nonstationary dynamics based on principles of neuromodulation, at the level of individual subjects. Approach. Previously, we developed the mesoscale individualized neural dynamics (MINDy) modeling approach to capture individualized brain dynamics which do not change over time. Here, we extend the MINDy approach by adding a modulatory component which is multiplied by a set of baseline, stationary connectivity weights. We validate this model on both synthetic data and publicly available electroencephalography data in the context of anesthesia, a known modulator of neural dynamics. Main results. We find that our modulated MINDy approach is accurate, individualized, and reliable. Additionally, we find that our models yield biologically interpretable inferences regarding the effects of propofol anesthesia on mesoscale cortical networks, consistent with previous literature on the neuromodulatory effects of propofol. Significance. Ultimately, our data-driven modeling approach is reliable and scalable, and provides insight into mechanisms underlying observed brain dynamics. Our modeling methodology can be used to infer insights about modulation dynamics in the brain in a number of different contexts.",

      "title": "Brain-to-text decoding with context-aware neural representations and large language models",
      "content": "Objective. Decoding attempted speech from neural activity offers a promising avenue for restoring communication abilities in individuals with speech impairments. Previous studies have focused on mapping neural activity to text using phonemes as the intermediate target. While successful, decoding neural activity directly to phonemes ignores the context dependent nature of the neural activity-to-phoneme mapping in the brain, leading to suboptimal decoding performance. Approach. In this work, we propose the use of diphone\u2014an acoustic representation that captures the transitions between two phonemes\u2014as the context-aware modeling target. We integrate diphones into existing phoneme decoding frameworks through a novel divide-and-conquer strategy in which we model the phoneme distribution by marginalizing over the diphone distribution. Our approach effectively leverages the enhanced context-aware representation of diphones while preserving the manageable class size of phonemes, a key factor in simplifying the subsequent phoneme-to-text conversion task. Main results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Brain-to-Text 2024 benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art phoneme error rate (PER) of 15.34% compared to 16.62% PER of monophone-based decoding. When coupled with finetuned large language models (LLMs), our method yields a Word error rate (WER) of 5.77%, significantly outperforming the 8.93% WER of the leading method in the benchmark. Significance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging context-aware neural representations and LLMs for brain-to-text decoding, thereby expanding the capabilities of speech neuroprostheses and paving the way toward restoring communication in individuals with speech impairments.",

Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
