      "content": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by the disruption of multiple signaling pathways, particularly those governing calcium homeostasis. Additionally, cell membranes in GBM exhibit altered lipidomic profiles, especially complex sialoglycans gangliosides, which affect plasma membranes both structurally and functionally. In this work we show a disruption of a plasma membrane molecular triad composed of gangliosides, neuroplastin (Np), and plasma membrane calcium ATPase (PMCA) in GBM, leading to a severely diminished PMCA activity. Our transcriptomic, epigenetic, proteomic, lipidomic, and in silico analyses demonstrated downregulation of Np and PMCA isoforms at mRNA and protein levels in our GBM cohort, in agreement with broader trends observed in public datasets. Analysis of the uniquely changed GBM ganglioside profile in the context of PMCA and Np expression and PMCA activity reveals GD3 as a key molecular determinant of reduced PMCA activity in GBM samples. In contrast, GD1b, necessary for optimal PMCA function in healthy tissue, is significantly reduced in GBM. Our findings establish the gangliosides-PMCA-Np nexus as a crucial complex involved in calcium signaling in GBM, contributing to GBM etiology and progression.",

      "title": "Neuronal silencing through depolarization block underlies odor discrimination",
      "content": "The olfactory system enables animals to distinguish between attractive and aversive odor sources through the perception of odorant molecules. A fundamental challenge is maintaining stable odor identity perception despite fluctuating stimulus intensities during navigation. Using the numerically simple olfactory system of the Drosophila larva, we combined a quantitative odor discrimination assay, electrophysiology, computational modelling, and ectopic expression of odorant receptors to study the encoding of odor identity. We found that depolarization block, which silences olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) at odor concentrations 3-4 log units above the detection threshold, enables odor discrimination by creating distinct patterns of OSN activity. In a minimal system with two functional OSNs, larvae discriminate between odors when depolarization block creates differential OSN silencing but fail to distinguish odors producing qualitatively similar activity patterns in both OSNs. This principle extends to odor mixtures and the fully functional olfactory system, where the high affinity of the OR42b odorant receptor for one of the test odors enables discrimination regardless of which OSN expresses OR42b. Our results indicate that depolarization block serves as an integral feature of olfactory coding alongside combinatorial OSN activation. Selective silencing of high-affinity OSNs creates distinct neural representations and enables discrimination between odors that would otherwise produce similar activity patterns. This mechanism appears evolutionarily conserved across sensory systems, from olfactory sensory neurons to photoreceptors, suggesting that selective neuronal silencing serves as a mechanism for maintaining distinct sensory representations across stimulus intensities.",

      "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
