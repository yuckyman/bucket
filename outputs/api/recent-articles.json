      "title": "Social Smiling and Laughter Are Linked to Enhanced Functional Brain Connectivity in Young Infants' Default Mode Network",
      "content": "The current study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate whether and how individual differences in positive social engagement among 5-month-old (N = 109; N = 35 final sample) infants relate to variability in functional connectivity in the human brain's Default-Mode Network (DMN). Neuroimaging results showed that on average infants displayed greater functional connectivity in the right than in the left hemisphere of the DMN, adding to prior work indicating faster...",

      "content": "In adults, cortical regions in the fusiform face area (FFA), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) respond selectively to faces, but underlie distinct perceptual and social processes. When do each of these regions, and their distinctive functions, develop? We review recent studies of awake human infants' cortical responses to faces using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results converge, and argue...",
