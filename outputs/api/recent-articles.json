      "title": "Assessing the digit organisation of focal hand dystonia using 7T functional MRI",
      "content": "Introduction: Focal hand dystonia (FHD) is typically treated with Botulinum Toxin (BTX/BoNT-A/Botox/ Onabotulinum Toxin Type A) injected into digit and wrist muscles to provide temporary symptomatic relief from muscle spasm. We use 7T functional MRI (fMRI) to study 1) differences in somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps between FHD individuals and age and sex-matched healthy volunteers (HV), 2) changes in cortical digit maps of FHD individuals after BTX treatment. Methods: Six FHD patients underwent behavioural measures and 7T fMRI at two timepoints: ~30 days after BTX treatment at peak efficacy (Post-BTX), immediately prior to their next injection ~100 days after treatment when therapeutic effects had declined (Pre-BTX). HVs were scanned at a single time point. Behavioural measures included temporal discrimination (TDT), amplitude thresholding (AMP) and spatial acuity grating orientation tasks. A somatosensory travelling wave (TW) digit-mapping fMRI task was performed on dominant/affected and non-dominant/un-affected hands, and a motor TW digit-mapping task on the dominant/affected hand. Fourier analysis derived digit maps which were compared to a probabilistic digit atlas, and population receptive field (pRF) mapping performed. Structural and resting state fMRI data were acquired. Results: Spatial acuity was lowered in the dominant/affected hand in FHD compared to HVs, while TDT and AMP measures showed no significant differences. Somatosensory and motor TW cortical digit maps in FHD and HV showed clear digit ordering. Somatosensory and motor cortical digit maps were more disordered in the dominant/affected hand than the non-dominant hand for FHD Post and Pre-BTX compared to HVs (DICE coefficient/Figure of Merit). Compared to the atlas, HV maps were in-line for both hands, while in FHD central tendency (CT) was lower in the dominant/affected hand than non-dominant hand. pRF sizes were larger in the FHD Pre-BTX group compared to HV and Post-BTX for the dominant hand. Conclusion: Behaviourally, FHD participants had lower spatial acuity than HVs. FHD digit maps had typical D1-D5 ordering, but DICE coefficients identified a disordered dominant hand in FHDs compared to HVs at both timepoints. The FHD Pre-BTX group had larger pRF sizes than Post-BTX and HVs, suggesting BTX treatment coincides with more localised touch perception.",
