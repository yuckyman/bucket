      "title": "Enabling wider access to human molecular neuroscience research in pain: A simple preservation method for human dorsal root ganglion neurons in Hibernate A media",
      "content": "The use of human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) from organ donors opens the door for research into the molecular biology and physiology of human nociceptors; however, there are barriers to working with this tissue including logistical difficulties and limited access. We present an approach using Hibernate media to temporarily store either whole DRGs or dissociated DRG neurons prior to culturing and functional testing. Dissociation of DRGs following temporary storage (4-16hrs) in Hibernate media resulted in similar neuronal and immune cell yield as acutely dissociated DRGs. Neurons derived from DRGs stored in Hibernate media prior to dissociation exhibited similar electrophysiological properties and capsaicin responses as acutely dissociated DRG neurons. Similarly, neurons from acutely dissociated DRGs stored in Hibernate media (>24hrs) and shipped to geographically distant laboratories produced neuronal cultures displaying comparable electrophysiological properties as acutely cultured neurons. This approach overcomes insurmountable logistical burdens and increases access to freshly recovered human DRGs.",

      "title": "Unpredictable circadian rhythm disruption in Wistar rats: biological and behavioural changes reflecting bipolar disorder pathophysiology",
      "content": "Circadian disturbances are implicated in dysregulation of arousal and general neurobiological function, contributing to conditions such as bipolar disorder (BD). However, the behavioural and biological consequences of circadian disruption on arousal dysfunction remain poorly quantified. Here, we developed a novel unpredictable circadian disruption (UCD) protocol - consisting of unpredictable exposure to light and sound - to investigate its impact on locomotor activity and its association with metabolic, inflammatory, stress, and circadian markers in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Forty-eight Wistar rats were exposed to UCD or control conditions, with or without corticosterone administration, for five weeks. Body weight was tracked throughout the study. Locomotor activity was assessed over the final two weeks (nine sessions) in an open-field arena. Real-time PCR was used to quantify NAc gene expression of inflammatory, metabolic, stress, and circadian markers, while liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measured neurotransmitter and central carbon metabolite concentrations. UCD animals exhibited initial hyperactivity at three weeks, followed by hypoactivity at four weeks. UCD was associated with increased NAc expression of inflammatory, stress, and circadian markers. Male UCD animals showed significant weight gain, an effect reversed in females. UCD also induced increases in NAc insulin resistance markers and reductions in central carbon metabolites, indicating disrupted striatal glucose metabolism. These findings highlight the central effects of circadian disruption on locomotor behaviour, stress, and immunometabolic signalling, offering mechanistic insights into arousal dysfunction in BD.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",

      "title": "Inhibiting JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways altered spontaneous network bursts and developmental trajectories of neuronal networks",
      "content": "Objective. Spontaneous network bursts (NBs) are critical for neuronal circuit development, influencing synaptogenesis and functional organization. While JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways are known to regulate synaptic plasticity, their specific roles in governing NBs dynamics and functional network organization remain poorly understood. This study investigates the roles of JNK and PI3K-Akt signaling in regulating spontaneous NBs dynamics and network organization in cultured neuronal networks. Approach. Using longitudinal microelectrode array (MEA) recordings from cultured cortical neurons (DIV14-49), we pharmacologically inhibited JNK (SP600125, JNK-IN-8) and PI3K-Akt (LY294002, GDC-0941) pathways. We quantitatively analyzed NBs profiles (maximum firing rate/MFR, burst length/BL, rising phase/RP) and functional network properties (modularity, betweenness centrality) during development. Main results. JNK inhibition increased MFR but reduced RP and FP, and decreased betweenness centrality and network modularity, particularly in DIV21. PI3K-Akt inhibition caused delayed effects: decreased MFR at DIV49 with increased RP, while enhancing network modularity. Developmental analysis revealed a transition from core-node-driven NBs (strong MFR-betweenness and BL-betweenness correlation at DIV14) to modularly organized NBs (strong BL-modularity and MFR-modularity correlation at DIV49), with pathway inhibitors differentially altering these relationships. Significance. Our findings demonstrate that JNK and PI3K-Akt pathways play distinct temporal roles in regulating NBs dynamics and network organization. JNK signaling is crucial for maintaining early core-node functionality, whereas PI3K-Akt signaling promotes the development of mature modular architecture. Our findings enhance the understanding of how molecular signaling influences neuronal network dynamics, contributing to a broader framework for studying neurodevelopmental principles.",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern.
