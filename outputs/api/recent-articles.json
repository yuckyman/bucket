      "title": "An integrated virtual reality platform for naturalistic neuroimaging with magnetoencephalography",
      "content": "Studying the brain in motion promises deep insights into the neural circuits that support complex, real-world behaviour. In humans, wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) enable magnetoencephalography (MEG) with millisecond temporal resolution and millimetre spatial precision during movement. Integrating this technology with virtual reality (VR) could enable fully naturalistic experimental paradigms, but magnetic interference from existing head-mounted displays (HMDs) prevents reliable whole-brain MEG recordings. Here, we present and validate a VR system that integrates with wearable, OPM-based MEG. At its core is a purpose-designed HMD with minimal ferromagnetic material, resulting in magnetic flux density two orders of magnitude lower than consumer-grade alternatives at comparable resolution and weight. Using phantom measurements and established perceptual and cognitive benchmark tasks across participants, we demonstrate robust stimulus-induced neuronal activity at both sensor and source level. Crucially, these sources span the entire brain, including visual, motor and prefrontal cortices, as well as hippocampus. Our proposed VR system is straightforward to produce, readily extendable, and enables whole-brain MEG during immersive, naturalistic behaviours.",

      "title": "Avatar facial expressions enhance social presence and inter-brain synchronization in virtual reality",
      "content": "Virtual reality (VR) has become a prominent medium for computer-mediated social interaction, yet the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning avatar-mediated communication remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated how dynamically modulated avatar facial expressions shape interpersonal interaction in VR. Pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative creativity task while interacting via avatars whose facial expressions were either amplified, natural, or expressionless. We collected subjective measures of body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction, while simultaneously recording neural activity using functional near-infrared-spectroscopy-based hyperscanning to assess inter-brain synchrony (IBS). Avatars displaying facial expressions, particularly amplified ones, significantly enhanced body ownership, social presence, and interpersonal attraction compared to expressionless avatars. At the neural level, visible avatar facial expressions were associated with IBS in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), regions that are commonly implicated in social-cognitive processes such as mentalizing and executive control. Although task performance did not differ across conditions, social presence was positively correlated with creative performance, suggesting that psychological connectedness supports collaborative creativity. Together, these findings indicate that avatar facial expressivity functions as a critical nonverbal social cue that facilitates affective and cognitive alignment between interaction partners. By linking subjective experience with inter-brain neural dynamics, this study provides empirical guidance for the design of virtual environments that promote social engagement and effective collaboration.",

      "title": "The schizophrenia associated protein DISC1 is a multivalent tetrameric hub of conserved ancient fold",
      "content": "DISC1 is a pleiotropic protein with essential roles in neuronal proliferation and migration, intracellular signalling and cargo transport. It associates with a diverse array of partner molecules in these contexts. Mutations at the DISC1 locus are strongly associated with a spectrum of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. Despite its clinical relevance, the molecular architecture and function of DISC1 have remained largely elusive. We present a cryo-EM structure of the entire conserved core region of DISC1. The structure reveals an intricate homotetrameric assembly that harbours conserved bacteria-derived UVR domains. Four of these domains, one from each monomer, mediate extensive contacts forming two asymmetric dimer units. The dimers in turn interface with each other at two distinct coiled coil domains to achieve a two-fold symmetric tetramer. Mutational analysis shows that this tetrameric architecture enables DISC1 to simultaneously bind multiple copies of NDE1 client protein. Importantly, tetramerization and partner binding are structurally independent functions of DISC1. Altogether, our study provides a compelling molecular model of an ancient bacteria protein fold participating in the assembly of a multivalent mammalian scaffold hub that can coordinate multiple partner molecules.",

      "title": "High-fidelity backpropagation through primate foveal cones",
      "content": "Primate vision has exceptionally high spatial acuity and contrast sensitivity. This performance originates in specialized photoreceptors of the fovea. These cones transduce light into electrical signals in the outer segment, and convey these signals to the presynaptic terminal for transmission. Backpropagating signals are also possible, as the terminal receives gap-junctional input from neighboring cones. Such signals could influence phototransduction itself. To test this idea, we recorded electrophysiologically from both ends of single cones dissociated from the macaque fovea. We found that backpropagation was effective despite the extreme slenderness and length of these cells. Backpropagation was also effective in a passive compartmental model, indicating that amplification by voltage-gated channels is not required. We then modeled mosaics of foveal cones coupled by terminal gap junctions. Despite faithful backpropagation of these inputs, they appear unlikely to influence phototransduction. Thus, even though foveal cones exhibit effective backpropagation, their encoding of visual information remains compartmentalized.",

      "title": "Higher-order intrinsic routes support flexible task-evoked communication",
      "content": "Flexible task-evoked communication requires the brain to transiently establish functional interactions that are not evident during rest, yet the network mechanisms supporting these newly formed connections remain unresolved. Using whole-brain functional MRI from 92 participants performing six cognitive tasks, we show that task-evoked communication is implemented within a constrained intrinsic network architecture rather than through large-scale rewiring. Across tasks, we found that approximately 70% of functional connections were preserved from rest, forming a dominant stable core, while task engagement selectively reconfigured a smaller subset of connections, primarily at the between-network level. While existing activity-flow models explain task-evoked information transfer primarily through direct stable core connections, we demonstrate that newly formed connections between regions lacking direct resting-state coupling were supported by selectively strengthened indirect higher-order resting-state routes embedded within the intrinsic scaffold. Network-level analyses revealed a multiscale organization of information transfer: we observed that direct stable routes dominated within-network communication, most prominently in sensory-motor and default mode systems, whereas indirect higher-order routes preferentially supported between-network integration through control and attentional systems. By extending activity-flow modelling to incorporate these higher-order intrinsic routes, we show a significant improvement in the prediction of task-evoked activity at the global, between-network scale, confirming their functional recruitment during task performance. Together, our findings identify higher-order intrinsic routes as a key mechanism enabling flexible task-evoked communication within a stable large-scale network architecture.",

      "title": "From Sensory Details to Verbal Codes: Visual Memory Reinstatement of Location and Color Features",
      "content": "Successful episodic memory depends on the reinstatement of encoding content and processes during retrieval. However, it remains unclear how such reinstatement (1) differs for various perceptual features, (2) supports subjective versus objective memory retrieval, and (3) relies on linguistic information. To investigate these three issues, we designed an fMRI study in which participants encoded and recalled the colors and spatial locations of object pictures, and provided subjective vividness and objective precision measures. We used encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) to identify feature-level reinstatement for location or color features, and trial-specific reinstatement for individual location trials or individual color trials. The study yielded three main findings. First, feature-level reinstatement in frontoparietal and visual regions supported both location and color memory, whereas trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex contributed to location memory and feature-level reinstatement in lateral/anterior temporal cortices, to color memory. Second, trial-specific reinstatement in early visual cortex supported both location vividness and precision, while feature-level reinstatement in inferior frontal gyrus contributed to color vividness, and trial-specific reinstatement in posterior inferior temporal gyrus (including the color area), to color precision. Finally, color name richness (the number of names associated with a particular color) enhanced color memory precision and modulated trial-specific color reinstatement in right anterior inferior temporal gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual and linguistic reinstatement play complementary roles in visual episodic memory: perceptual replay provides fine-grained sensory details, whereas linguistic replay can scaffold and refine these representations, especially for features that are easier to verbalize such as colors.",

      "title": "White Matter Lesion Asymmetry and Carotid Intraplaque Hemorrhage: A Novel Imaging Phenotype for Stroke Risk in Older Men",
      "content": "Background: While identifying high-risk carotid disease remains a significant clinical challenge, the specific role of carotid intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is poorly understood. Although IPH has been linked to white matter lesion (WML) burden, current assessments overlook the directional impact of plaque instability on the brain. This study sought to determine whether IPH is an independent driver of asymmetric WML pathology and evaluate if this phenotype can identify a high-risk demographic for TIA and stroke. Methods: This multi-center retrospective study analyzed 264 participants (mean age 71.8 years) from the Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (2010-2015). Participants underwent 3T MRI to assess carotid IPH and WMLs. We quantified WMLs using a deep-learning pipeline to extract three biomarkers: volume (WML-ICV), intensity (WML-Intensity), and intensity ratio (WML-IR). The Asymmetry Index Measure (AIM) defined the inter-hemispheric log-ratio, while the association between IPH and AIM was examined using multivariable linear regression adjusted for age, sex, stenosis, and scanner manufacturer. A secondary composite outcome of TIA/stroke was analyzed via logistic regression to evaluate the interaction between IPH, age, and sex. Results: While whole-brain WML burden did not significantly differ by IPH status (p > 0.60), IPH status was a robust independent predictor of hemispheric asymmetry (WML-ICV: p = 0.01; WML-Intensity, p = 0.01). Post-hoc analysis confirmed WML burden was significantly higher in IPH+ older males (=> 70 years) compared to younger cohorts (p < 0.04). This older male subgroup also demonstrated 4.57-fold higher adjusted odds of TIA/stroke (p = 0.02) compared to other demographic subgroups (all p > 0.87). Conclusions: Carotid IPH is independently associated with a rightward asymmetric WML phenotype not captured by global metrics. This imaging marker identifies a high-risk demographic of older males with a nearly five-fold increase in clinical events, suggesting that hemispheric-level analysis provides critical prognostic value for stroke risk stratification.",

      "content": "Introduction: Air pollution (AirPoll) is a major environmental risk factor for age-related cognitive decline and dementia, yet we poorly understood the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying its effects and their potential attenuation. Methods: We combined single cell RNA sequencing with immunohistochemistry to determine transcriptional responses in microglia, astrocytes, neurons and neural stem cells in the hippocampus of mice following exposure to chronic diesel exhaust particle (DEP). Differential gene expression profiles were compared between filtered-air and DEP exposed animals. The gamma secretase modulator GSM-15606 (BPN) was used to probe selective rescue of inflammatory signatures across distinct cell populations. Results: DEP exposure triggered robust inflammatory programs in microglia and astrocytes, including upregulation of cytokine signaling components, innate immune receptors, stress-responsive transcription factors, and markers of reactive glial phenotypes. In neural stem cells, DEP induced activation of gliosis-associated pathways, including Il6st, Stat3, and Txnip, consistent with a pro-inflammatory state that may bias lineage decisions. Immunostaining confirmed a significant reduction in immature neurons in the neurogenic niche after AirPoll exposure. GSM-15606 attenuated many DEP-induced transcriptional alterations in microglia and astrocytes, reducing expression of inflammatory mediators and reactive gliosis markers, but did not modulate the inflammatory profile of neural stem cells. Conclusions: AirPoll activates divergent inflammatory pathways across hippocampal cell populations and suppresses neurogenesis. Targeting inflammation with GSM-15606 selectively reverses glial but not neural stem cell responses, highlighting cell-type-specific mechanisms and potential therapeutic pathways to mitigate pollution-related cognitive vulnerability. These results support GSM-15606 as a protective agent against AirPoll-induced hippocampal dysfunction and amyloidogenic stress.",

      "title": "Compression Detects Changes in Spiking Neural Data from Cortical Lesions",
      "content": "Objective: The complexity of neural data changes as the brain processes information during events. Universal lossless compression algorithms, which are broadly applicable and grounded in information theory, identify and exploit redundancies in data in order to compress it to essentially-optimal sizes regardless of underlying statistics. These algorithms may be used to conveniently and efficiently estimate a given signal's Shannon entropy rate, a biologically relevant measure of the complexity of a signal. It is therefore natural to explore their effectiveness in the analysis of spiking neural data. Approach: This work focuses on using compression to analyze recordings (96-channel Utah arrays) taken from motor cortex of animals performing reaching tasks for three days before and three days after administering electrolytic lesions (Subject U: 4 lesions, H: 3). In particular, we use the inverse compression ratio (ICR), which compares the sizes of compressed and uncompressed data to estimate the amount of statistically unique information. We calculate ICR with temporally-independent lossless compression (gzip) and temporally-dependent lossy compression (H.264, MPEG-2). Compression-based ICR was compared to single-neuron measures used to understand spiking data, such as average firing rates and Fano factor. Compression is also compared to common dimensionality reduction techniques, principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA). Main Results: Statistical tests on aggregate data comparing each metric before and after lesioning reveal that ICR is able to significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.01) detect lesions with higher accuracy than single-neuron metrics, but not dimensionality reduction (ICR methods: 85.7%, single-neuron methods: 78.6%, dimensionality reduction: 100%). Additionally, statistical results on the same data show that ICR metrics remain more stable than single-neuron methods after lesion. The bitrate parameter of lossy compression algorithms is swept to better understand the effect of information rates and \"optimal\" compression on lesion detection performance. Our conclusions are confirmed by the same analyses performed on several different simulated neural datasets. Significance: These results suggest that compression algorithms may be a useful tool to detect and better understand perturbations to the underlying structure of neural data. Information-theoretic analyses may complement techniques like dimensionality reduction and firing rate tuning as a convenient and useful tool to characterize neural data.",

      "title": "A dual neural system supporting multi-tasking cognitive flexibility",
      "content": "One ubiquitous feature of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly switch between multiple tasks. Abstract task representations provide a basis for task learning, switching, and generalization, yet how the brain coordinates multiple task representations to support multitasking and task-switching remains poorly understood. We recorded functional MRI activity in human participants while they concurrently held multiple task rules in working memory and prioritized different rules for stimulus processing across trials. Our results reveal two distinct coding schemes for task prioritization. First, an active coding scheme supports the spatial separation of prioritized and unprioritized task rules: prioritized rules are represented across a distributed cortical network, whereas unprioritized rules are only found in the posterior cortex. Second, besides this active scheme, subregions of the default mode network, including the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, contribute to offloading task representations into an unprioritized state and subsequently maintain sustained representations of these rules across trials via latent neural codes. Behavioral predictions using on-task, trial-wise and sustained, block-wise representations further support the neural dissociation. These findings unveil a dual neural system with distinct coding schemes that jointly enable cognitive flexibility for task implementation and switching.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Curious if this is just my experience or pretty common. In a lot of projects I\u2019ve touched, a big percentage of CI failures aren\u2019t actual logic bugs. They\u2019re things like: dependency updates breaking builds flaky tests lint/formatting failures misconfigured GitHub Actions / CI YAML caching issues missing or wrong env vars small config changes that suddenly block merges It often feels like a lot of time is spent just getting CI back to green rather than working on product features. For people who deal with CI regularly: What kinds of CI failures eat the most time for you? How often do you see failures that are basically repetitive / mechanical fixes? Does CI feel like a productivity booster for you, or more like a tax? Genuinely curious how widespread this is.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/According-Figure-829\"> /u/According-Figure-829 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qri8i7/how_much_time_do_you_actually_spend_fixing_ci/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qri8i7/how_much_time_do_you_actually_spend_fixing_ci/\">[comments]</a></span>",
