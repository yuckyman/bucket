      "title": "Misprediction Sensitivity Is Diminished for Action-effects Resulting from Stimulus-driven Movement",
      "content": "While volitional movement is thought to be initiated based on its anticipated capacity to achieve sensory goals, stimulus-driven movement may be generated with less regard for its specific effects. Sensorimotor processes that make use of action-effect predictions may therefore differ between these forms of movement, including sensory attenuation and the detection of mispredicted motor effects. In this study, we explored sensory attenuation by comparing the evoked response of externally-generated tones with those produced by participants (n = 61), both according to their own timing (i.e., volitionally) and in response to simple visual cues (i.e., stimulus-driven). The influence of stimulus identity prediction (i.e., the predictability of tone frequency) on N1 amplitudes was not found to differ between self- and externally-generated stimuli, or on the basis of volitional control. Reduced P2 amplitudes were observed in response to self-generated tones, which may suggest that these were subject to higher levels of attentional control, including processes involved in the termination of attention. To explore misprediction sensitivity, we compared the influence of stimulus identity prediction on N2b component amplitudes. A significant interaction was found to reflect heightened sensitivity to mispredicted outcomes of volitional action, compared with those of stimulus-driven movement. In light of recent evidence that attentional suppression may attenuate the primary cortical response to outcomes of stimulus-driven movement, we propose that this mechanism might also serve to diminish misprediction sensitivity. As such, these effects may represent important features of sensorimotor processing that assist in differentiating stimuli on the basis of self-generation and intentionality.",

      "title": "High-frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Can Improve Attentional Control Under Stress: Behavioral and Electrophysiological Evidence",
      "content": "Psychological stress impairs cognition, forcing attention toward stressor-related information. However, stress may reallocate limited cognitive resources in adaptive ways. How stress modulates the attentional control remains unclear. In this study, the stress-related changes in both target processing and distractor interference were investigated in Experiment 1, where an additional singleton task was employed with a stress group and a control group. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with both stress responses and attentional control. The role of the left DLPFC in regulating attention control under stress was investigated using repetitive TMS in Experiment 2, which included control-vertex, stress-vertex, and stress-DLPFC groups. Electroencephalography was recorded. The results showed that (1) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited increased RT attentional capture effect and greater distractor-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, indicating increased distractor interference under stress; (2) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited a greater target-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, suggesting enhanced target processing under stress; and (3) compared with the stress-vertex group, the stress-DLPFC group exhibited greater target-elicited N2pc effect, but a similar distractor-elicited N2pc effect, suggesting that left-DLPFC stimulation improved target processing but exerted no influence on distractor processing. In addition, faster RTs, along with a reduced RT attentional capture effect, were found for the stress-DLPFC group, implying that the target processing following left-DLPFC stimulation might be less affected by the distractor due to the heightened target processing. The left DLPFC may play a crucial role in modulating attentional control under stress.",

      "title": "A Role of Pupil-linked Arousal, Cingulo-insular Cortex, and Intralaminar Thalamus for Auditory Near-threshold Perception",
      "content": "The perception of near-threshold tones varies strongly across trials, likely because of fluctuations in sustained attention or arousal. We used parallel fMRI and pupillometry to study the role of attention networks for the detection of near-threshold tones in three phases: (1) passive listening, (2) active detection of salient tones, and (3) active detection of near-threshold tones. Results confirmed previous findings from magnetoencephalography that auditory cortex activity and pupil-dilation responses for near-threshold tones were only observed when task-relevant, stronger for hit trials, but also present for miss trials. We then sought which attention-related areas show a similar response pattern, and found it in insular cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, and inferior precentral sulcus. Moreover, activity in the insula was already stronger for hit than miss trials in the prestimulus interval. Activity for hit trials was also observed in a number of subcortical nuclei, including thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, and the colliculi. Like insula, activity in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus additionally showed activity for miss trials and stronger activity for hit trials in the baseline. Finally, BOLD activity correlated to spontaneous pupil fluctuations was evaluated and revealed biphasic activation and deactivation in a widespread cortical network, with a maximum 3 sec and minimum 7 sec after pupil dilation. The cortical networks included insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, retro-splenial, and sensory cortex. Overall, these data identify the cingulo-insular network and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei as potential sources of fluctuations in auditory cortex activity in the context of near-threshold tone detection.",
