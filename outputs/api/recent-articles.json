      "title": "Resting-state EEG power and machine-learning classification in adult males with gambling disorder",
      "content": "BackgroundGambling disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction sharing neurobiological features with substance use disorders, yet objective biomarkers remain limited. This study examined resting-state EEG power and applied machine learning to identify potential electrophysiological markers of GD.MethodsResting eyes-closed Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded from 47 individuals with GD and 32 healthy controls. Absolute and relative power across delta (1\u20134 Hz), theta (4\u20138 Hz), alpha (8\u201313 Hz), and beta (13\u201330 Hz) bands were quantified over eight cortical regions. Group differences and correlations with the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) were analyzed. Multiple comparisons were controlled using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier was trained to differentiate GD from controls based on EEG features.ResultsGroup differences in EEG power were subtle, with GD showing significantly higher delta power in the left temporal region (p = 0.032, d = 0.43). Within the GD group, greater gambling severity was associated with higher absolute beta power across frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital regions (r \u2248 0.40\u20130.50, p < 0.01), and these associations remained significant after FDR correction (pFDR < 0.05). The LDA model using absolute power achieved 73.7% classification accuracy (AUC = 0.74), whereas relative power yielded near-chance accuracy (57.9%).ConclusionsGD is characterized by subtle but meaningful EEG alterations, particularly increased beta activity linked to gambling severity. Multivariate EEG patterns can distinguish GD from controls, supporting the potential of resting-state EEG as a biomarker for clinical assessment and severity monitoring in behavioral addiction.",

      "content": "IntroductionEarly life stress (ELS) has been identified as a major risk factor for the development of various disorders in adulthood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of ELS on adult brain function by focusing on the aperiodic component (exponent and offset) of neural activity\u2014a novel neurophysiological marker thought to reflect the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance.MethodsWe recruited 65 healthy adults as participants in this study. Resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data were recorded for 5 min with eyes closed. ELS was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Japanese version, National Institute of Mental Health (CTQ-JNIMH), and current psychological status was evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State\u2013Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Aperiodic components were extracted from the MEG power spectra using the FOOOF algorithm, and their relationships with CTQ-JNIMH scores were analyzed.ResultsAccording to the CTQ-JNIMH, 40% of the participants reported experiencing emotional neglect and 27.7% reported physical neglect, while reports of abuse were relatively rare. A significant negative correlation was observed between emotional neglect severity and the aperiodic offset in the left pars orbitalis, which remained significant after false discovery rate correction. In contrast, the aperiodic offset in the left pars orbitalis did not correlate with the current psychological measures (BDI and STAI).DiscussionThese findings suggest that emotional neglect in early life may induce long-lasting alterations in brain function, potentially shifting the E/I balance, as reflected by the aperiodic offset, toward increased excitability in the left pars orbitalis.",

      "title": "Glutathione metabolism as a key regulator of oxidative hippocampal injury in sepsis-associated encephalopathy: an integrated proteomics and metabolomics study",
      "content": "IntroductionSepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is characterized by acute neurological dysfunction and hippocampal damage, with oxidative stress being a key driver of neuronal injury. However, the role of dysfunctional glutathione (GSH) metabolism in hippocampal injury during SAE remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the molecular and biochemical changes in the hippocampus induced by SAE through multi-omics integration (proteomics and metabolomics), thereby providing a theoretical basis for improved neuroprotective strategies.MethodsA murine SAE model was established via cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Subsequent analyses included assessments of hippocampal tissue damage, microglial activation, and cognitive function in mice. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and malondialdehyde (MDA) (oxidative stress markers) were detected. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), while metabolomic profiling was used to characterize metabolic changes. Multi-omics integration was conducted to reveal core regulatory networks, and mechanistic validation focused on the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and GPX4.ResultsThe CLP-induced SAE model showed significant hippocampal damage, microglial activation, cognitive deficits, and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ROS, and MDA. Proteomic analysis identified 156 DEPs, with glutathione metabolism being the most severely disrupted pathway. Metabolomic results confirmed systemic glutathione depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by reduced levels of S-lactoylglutathione, carnitine species, and NAD+ intermediates. Multi-omics integration revealed a \u201chigh-inflammation, high-oxidation, low-metabolism\u201d triad, which is mainly regulated by the Stat1-(2-carboxypropyl)-Cysteamine-C3 interaction axis. Mechanistic validation further confirmed downregulated expression of Nrf2, HO-1, and GPX4 in CLP mice, establishing a direct link between glutathione dysregulation and neuronal apoptosis.DiscussionOur findings demonstrate that glutathione metabolism serves as a pivotal hub in the pathogenesis of SAE. The identified glutathione-related pathways provide potential therapeutic targets for alleviating oxidative stress-induced hippocampal injury in SAE, offering new insights for the clinical management of SAE-related neurological damage.",

      "content": "IntroductionPrevious studies have shown that the proper functioning of both mitochondria and the glymphatic system transporting metabolites are essential for brain health. The aim of this systematic review was to identify the current evidence-based data regarding the relationship between mitochondria and the glymphatic system.MethodsThis systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science were searched on June 11, 2024, for eligible studies published until June 1, 2024.ResultsOf 103 studies, six were included: two original studies and four review articles. All the included studies consistently indicated that the mitochondria and the glymphatic system are likely interconnected, with evidence suggesting several potential links between them. According to original studies, mitochondrial abnormalities in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) may disrupt glymphatic system function. The included reviews highlighted REM sleep deprivation, melatonin, and inflammation as potential factors linking mitochondria and the glymphatic system.DiscussionThe relationship between mitochondria and the glymphatic system is complex. Further research is needed to clarify the precise mechanisms of interaction as the current literature is largely speculative. Existing evidence suggests that mitochondrial abnormalities are present in iNPH and IIH, conditions related to impaired CSF flow and impaired glymphatic function. In addition, sleep and melatonin potentially link mitochondrial activity and the glymphatic system function and thus offer potential avenues to ameliorate disorders associated with glymphatic dysfunction by enhancing mitochondrial activity.",

      "title": "Central effects of short-term spinal cord stimulation in postherpetic neuralgia: a longitudinal fMRI and DTI study",
      "content": "ObjectivePostherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a refractory neuropathic pain following herpes zoster reactivation, lacks clear central mechanisms for emerging therapies like short-term spinal cord stimulation (stSCS). This longitudinal study used multimodal neuroimaging to examine the effects of 14-day stSCS on brain function and white matter microstructure in PHN patients, and to identify neural correlates of clinical improvements.MethodsIn this longitudinal, single-arm, pre-post study, 17 PHN patients received 14\u202fdays of continuous stSCS. Clinical outcomes including pain intensity (Numeric Rating Scale, NRS), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), were assessed pre-stSCS and 3\u202fdays post-stSCS. Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data were acquired at both time points. Longitudinal changes in amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF (fALFF) were analyzed, alongside white matter integrity via TBSS and ROI analysis of key tracts.ResultsPost-stSCS, significant improvements occurred in all clinical outcomes (Wilcoxon signed-rank, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Neuroimaging showed no DTI microstructural changes but significant fALFF increases in regions including the dorsal striatum. Notably, right medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) fALFF increases correlated with NRS reductions (Spearman\u2019s r\u202f=\u202f0.71, FDR-corrected p\u202f=\u202f0.036). Baseline cingulum integrity (lower FA, higher MD/RD) predicted greater striatal fALFF changes (r\u202f=\u202f\u00b10.75, FDR-corrected p\u202f<\u202f0.02).ConclusionThese findings suggest that stSCS\u2019s early clinical benefits in PHN are mediated by rapid functional reorganization rather than immediate microstructural changes. This reorganization appears prominent within fronto-striatal circuits: specifically, mOFC functional changes correlate with analgesia, while baseline cingulum integrity predicts subsequent striatal plasticity. This provides initial mechanistic insights into stSCS and suggest that baseline brain structure could be explored as a potential biomarker for treatment response, warranting validation in larger, controlled cohorts.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate alterations in brain activity due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning (ACOP) and their relationship with clinical manifestations using static and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) analyses.MethodsResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and clinical data were obtained from 31 ACOP patients and 28 healthy controls. The static ALFF value and dynamic ALFF variability were measured and compared between groups. Partial correlation analysis explored the relationships between changes in ALFF and clinical features in ACOP patients.ResultsACOP patients exhibited increased dynamic ALFF in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and decreased static ALFF in the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG) compared to controls. Aberrant dynamic ALFF in the left SFG and MFG was negatively correlated with MoCA-B scores (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.430, p\u202f=\u202f0.036; r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.439, p\u202f=\u202f0.032).ConclusionACOP patients exhibited abnormal instability in intrinsic brain activity, particularly in prefrontal areas, where temporal variability in local brain activity correlates with cognitive performance. This study highlights the value of combined static and dynamic ALFF approaches in understanding brain disturbances caused by CO exposure, providing new insights into the neuropathological mechanisms of ACOP.",

      "content": "ObjectiveVestibular migraine (VM) and Meniere's disease (MD) are episodic vertigo disorders with overlapping symptoms, often leading to misdiagnosis. This study aimed to identify a cost-effective diagnostic method to distinguish VM and MD.MethodsIn this retrospective study, 108 VM patients and 65 MD patients were enrolled. Clinical symptoms, interictal videonystagmography (VNG) findings, and caloric test results were analyzed and compared between the two groups.ResultsThe VM group had a significantly higher proportion of females (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in any features of interictal nystagmus, including spontaneous or positional nystagmus (all p > 0.05). However, the caloric test revealed a significantly higher proportion of canal paresis (CP) in MD patients compared to VM patients (p < 0.001).ConclusionWhile clinical symptom profiles effectively distinguish VM from MD, interictal nystagmus analysis has limited diagnostic value. The caloric test is a reliable and practical tool, as the presence of significant canal paresis strongly indicates MD over VM. Combining symptom evaluation with caloric testing offers a cost-effective strategy for the differential diagnosis of these common vestibular disorders.",

      "content": "When listening to polyphonic music, we often perceive a melody as the figure against the ground of accompanying sounds. However, with repeated exposure, this figure\u2013ground relationship may naturally shift, allowing the melody to recede into the ground. In a previous study, we found the consistent pattern of frontotemporal connectivity for the \u201cTwinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u201d (TTLS) melody in the headings of two Variations (II and IV) in Mozart's 12 Variations, K. 265, indicating that the TTLS melody, but not the different lower voices, was the figure. However, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern may change in the same phrases repeating in the two variations. In the current study, we examined how frontotemporal connectivity changes in the repeated phrases. In the results, the frontotemporal connectivity pattern between the two variations changed in the final phrase after repeated passages. This suggests that the shift in the figure\u2013ground relationship persists, with the TTLS melody becoming less prominent while the lower voices become relatively more prominent. Additionally, frontotemporal connectivity was strongly correlated with temporofrontal connectivity in the opposite direction. Finally, our data indicate that TTLS melody-based and sensory-based processes in response to a switched figure\u2013ground relationship, are incorporated into the bidirectional connections between frontotemporal and temporofrontal connectivity. Our study highlights the brain's ability to reconfigure figure\u2013ground relationships in the processing of musical voices.",

      "content": "IntroductionAlthough previous studies have reported associations between gonadotropins, testosterone, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), their longitudinal relationships with cognitive decline and temporal lobe atrophy remain insufficiently characterized. This study examined the association between baseline hormone levels and cognitive decline and temporal lobe volume loss trajectories, and whether these associations vary by sex or APOE\u03b54 status.MethodsThis study included 490 participants (378 MCI/112 AD; 311 men/179 women; mean age = 75.01 \u00b1 7.52) from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Baseline plasma levels of gonadotropins (FSH, LH) and total testosterone (TT) were measured using Luminex xMAP multiplex immunoassay. Cognitive decline was assessed longitudinally through MMSE and ADAS-Cog 13 scores. Temporal lobe atrophy was quantified using tensor-based morphometry of 1.5T MRI scans, with bilateral temporal lobe volumes scaled to a normalized reference (1,000 = baseline). Linear mixed effects models were employed to relate baseline plasma hormones to longitudinal cognitive performance and temporal lobe volume.ResultsLongitudinal analyses showed that higher baseline FSH levels were associated with faster cognitive decline (MMSE: \u03b2 = \u22120.025, P = 0.012; ADAS-cog: \u03b2 = 0.066, P = 0.020) and accelerated temporal lobe atrophy (\u03b2 = \u22120.115, P = 0.005) in fully adjusted models. LH was also associated with faster temporal lobe atrophy (\u03b2 = \u22120.077, P = 0.034), while TT showed no significant association. Sex-stratified analyses showed that higher TT was associated with slower MMSE decline in women (\u03b2 = 0.022, P = 0.032) but not in men (P = 0.762), with a significant sex interaction (P-interaction = 0.020). Modification effects of APOE\u03b54 status on cognition and temporal lobe volume changes were not observed for FSH, LH, or TT.DiscussionThe results indicate that in individuals across the AD spectrum, elevated gonadotropin levels may exert deleterious, domain-specific effects on cognitive decline or temporal lobe atrophy. Women with lower TT levels may experience faster cognitive progression. Although future studies incorporating additional longitudinal hormone measurements and cognitive trajectories are warranted, our results underscore the importance of gonadotropins and testosterone in AD progression.",

      "title": "Speech and music source separation for cochlear implant users: front-end and end-to-end approach",
      "content": "A cochlear implant (CI) is a surgically implanted neuroprosthetic device designed to restore auditory perception in individuals with profound sensorineural hearing loss. While CI users generally demonstrate good speech intelligibility in quiet listening environments, their performance significantly declines in the presence of competing sound sources. Moreover, music perception and appreciation remain limited for many CI users. These limitations are largely attributed to the inadequate representation of pitch information, which is critical for both music and speech stream segregation in complex auditory scenes. To address these challenges, source separation techniques have been increasingly employed to enhance target speech and isolate singing voices in music. Previous research has shown that CI users report greater music enjoyment when vocals are enhanced relative to the accompanying background instrumentation. Building on this, recent studies have leveraged deep neural networks (DNNs) as both front-end and end-to-end modules to improve speech intelligibility and music enjoyment for CI users. In the present study, we compare front-end and end-to-end DNN-based source separation approaches for two tasks: speech masked by competing speech and singing music. All implemented pipelines were first evaluated using objective instrumental metrics. Based on these results, the models were subsequently assessed in a listening experiment involving nine bilateral CI users. While the end-to-end pipeline outperformed the front-end pipeline in speech understanding tasks, the front-end approach yielded higher scores in music appreciation questionnaires. These findings support the hypothesis that CI sound coding strategies can be effectively combined with DNN-based source separation models. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the limited performance of end-to-end music source separation in enhancing music perception for CI users may be due to the absence of a dedicated sound coding strategy tailored for instrumental music.",

      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",
