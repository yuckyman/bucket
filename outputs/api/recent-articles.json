      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Breath as an internal context: Respiratory phase alignment between encoding and retrieval optimizes memory performance.",
      "content": "Increasing evidence suggests that respiratory rhythms are crucial for cognitive functions. Although recent findings suggest that respiratory activity may serve as an internal contextual framework during memory processes, the contribution of specific respiratory phases to encoding and retrieval remains unclear. Here, we investigated the breathing-dependent performance of 30 healthy volunteers during a visual delayed matching-to-sample recognition memory task while their nasal respiration was monitored. Reaction times (RTs) decreased when visual cues were both encoded and retrieved during the late phase of exhalation. In contrast, longer RTs were observed during late exhalation at retrieval when encoding occurred either (i) during a period that encompassed inspiratory onset (i.e., exhalation-to-inhalation transition or EI transition) or (ii) during the early phase of inhalation. These contrasting outcomes under identical retrieval conditions highlight the phase-dependent effects of respiration, specifically the alignment of respiratory timing between encoding and retrieval. Importantly, we found that the late phase of exhalation during both encoding and retrieval may represent a favorable temporal window for shaping memory performance. These findings suggest that respiratory phase alignment modulates memory processes by providing an interoceptive, phase-dependent context for cognition.",

      "title": "Capturing Rapid Behavioral Adaptation in an Updated Theory of the Hippocampal Cognitive Map and its Neural Implementation",
      "content": "Animals rapidly and flexibly adapt their behavior by forming an internal cognitive map. The cognitive map has been studied at multiple levels, including normative, representational, and mechanistic accounts, often focused on the role of the hippocampus. Here, we propose a framework extending the normative successor representation (SR) theory and its link to hippocampal representations and processes, incorporating recent insights into the neural basis of rapid adaptation in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1. In our model, CA3 uses temporally symmetric behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP) to encode spatiotemporal proximity experienced during exploration, CA1 uses temporally asymmetric BTSP to encode a perceived salience-weighted SR, and downstream areas learn successor feature predictions that can guide behavior in accordance with a behaving animal's motivational state. Through simulations of a rodent exploring a maze, we show that the network rapidly learns this representation and further strengthens the map by generating spontaneous replay activity during subsequent offline phase. Behavioral simulations show how these processes give rise to motivational state-dependent choice, rapid behavioral adaptation to changes in the availability or reward, and one-trial avoidance learning.",

      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

      "title": "Profiling miRNAs involved in Human Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cell Differentiation and Maturation",
      "content": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved post-transcriptional regulators that play critical roles in cellular development and differentiation across species. Although the importance of miRNAs in oligodendrocyte lineage cell (OLLC) differentiation has been extensively studied in rodent models, their roles in human OL development remain less understood. To address this gap, we used a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) reporter system designed to study human OLs and OL progenitor cells (OPCs). Using an optimized differentiation protocol, we used the reporter hESCs to generate and isolate well-characterized OLLCs at specific developmental stages and performed next-generation sequencing-based miRNA profiling to identify stage-specific miRNAs enriched during OL lineage specification and maturation. In addition to canonical miRNAs known to be enriched at various stages of OL development, our study identified several lesser-known miRNAs with distinct stage-specific enrichment patterns that may serve as useful molecular markers for classifying human CNS cell types in future studies. Target analysis of OPC- and OL-enriched miRNAs revealed key genes, including transcription factors ZNF488 and DLX1, cytoskeletal regulator CSNK2B, and potassium channel gene KCNJ1, along with key signaling pathways such as AKT, SMAD2/3, estrogen receptor, and insulin signaling, which regulate OPC and OL lineage function. These findings advance our understanding of the OLLC-specific miRNAs, and miRNA-mediated regulatory networks governing human OL differentiation and maturation and provide promising therapeutic targets for future studies aimed at restoring myelin integrity and improving outcomes in demyelinating diseases.",

      "title": "Modeling Individualized Adolescent Mental Health through a Multifactorial Causal Framework to Identify Potential Intervention Strategies",
      "content": "Adolescence is a sensitive period for the emergence of psychopathology. During this time, physiological changes and environmental exposures jointly shape brain development and influence cognitive and personality maturation, collectively heightening vulnerability to mental disorders. However, the complexity of interactions between these factors has hindered a systems-level understanding of mental health and the causal roles of cognition and personality in psychopathology. In this study, we proposed a multifactorial causal framework integrating brain, pubertal, environmental, and behavioral factors to characterize heterogeneity in adolescent mental health trajectories at the individual level. We then investigated latent causal pathways linking cognition and personality to mental health outcomes and identified potential personalized intervention targets. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset (N = 4,501), we analyzed 165 behavioral pairs connecting cognition and personality traits to mental health symptoms. Using cross-sectional multivariate mediation and longitudinal interaction-inclusive analyses, we identified 68 behavioral pairs showing significant causal relationships, with brain and environmental exposures contributing to most pathways, while pubertal factors exhibited limited involvement. Individualized interpretive analyses further revealed 23 pairs suggesting potential interventions with response rates exceeding 50%. Among these, behavioral inhibition, negative urgency, and processing speed emerged as the most common intervention targets, whereas psychosis symptoms and attention problems were the most likely issues to improve. Overall, our study advances a comprehensive framework capturing the multifactorial and heterogeneous nature of adolescent mental health, delineates specific causal pathways from cognitive and personality traits to psychopathology, and provides a principled basis for potential individualized intervention strategies.",
