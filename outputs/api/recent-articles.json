      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",
