      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Sensitization and tolerance are two phenomena often studied independently despite overlapping neurobiological substrates. Each has extensive research showing their influence on the development and maintenance of addiction, but the degree to which they drive escalation in cocaine self-administration is poorly understood. Using self-administration, noncontingent methods, and pose-estimation, we demonstrate that incentive salience, not psychomotor sensitization or tolerance, drives the escalation of cocaine self-administration in heterogenous stock rats. Individual differences in psychomotor sensitization or tolerance were found to have no effect on cocaine intake. Incentive salience as measured by locomotion and active lever entrances per meter occurring before the self-administration session began (pre-lever) during Short Access was found to predict intake during Long Access. Both pre-lever locomotion and active lever entrances per meter were found to increase during Long Access and after two-to-three days of abstinence. Critically, rats with low pre-lever activity during Short Access escalated both their intake and pre-lever measures by the end of Long Access to levels comparable with high pre-lever activity rats who maintained their elevated responding. These findings support the notion that incentive salience during Short Access is a catalyst to escalated use and an early marker of addiction vulnerability. Moreover, they suggest that individuals initially resistant to incentive salience can, with sufficient exposure, become sensitized and escalate cocaine use to the same level as more susceptible individuals. Analysis of pre-lever activity offers a novel longitudinal behavioral marker to predict vulnerability and provides a framework for understanding individual trajectories of addiction.",

      "title": "Induction of cortical ON/OFF periods in awake mice fulfills sleep functions",
      "content": "Can animals obtain core benefits of sleep while remaining awake? In mammals, slow-wave sleep is characterized by synchronized neuronal activity alternating between ON and OFF periods. Slow-wave activity and synchrony reflect sleep need, are correlated with synaptic strength in cortical circuits, and promote synaptic down-selection and memory consolidation. To address the above question, we locally induced alternating ON/OFF periods during wakefulness using optogenetics in mice. This led to a local, ipsilateral reduction of slow-wave activity and synchrony during subsequent sleep and to reduced markers of synaptic strength. Moreover, bilateral induction of OFF periods over sensorimotor cortex during sleep deprivation restored memory consolidation. Thus, inducing ON/OFF activity during wakefulness is sufficient to reduce local sleep need and fulfills core functions of sleep.",

      "title": "BrAVe: a unified framework for 3D interactive and integrative analysis of cross-modal multi-scale brain atlas data in diverse species",
      "content": "The brain exhibits remarkable complexity across molecular, structural, and functional modalities spanning spatial scales from micro- to macro-levels1-3. Recent advances in brain mapping have yielded increasingly sophisticated multimodal, multi-scale atlases in diverse species4-26. However, integrative analysis across these modalities and scales remains hindered by methodological and tool limitations27. Here, we present BrAVe (BrainAtlas Viewer), an open-source, species-agnostic framework for 3D visualized and integrative analysis of brain atlas data across modalities and scales. BrAVe supports five core data types--volumetric images, parcellated regions, feature points, neuronal tracings, and networks--in standard formats (e.g., .nrrd, .stl, .csv., and .swc), accommodating multimodal and multi-scale datasets from flies to primates. For single-modality datasets, BrAVe provides a suite of analyses, with regional distribution profiling as a common feature. This is exemplified by its single-neuron morphology analysis, which enables quantitative characterization of geometry, topology, projection, clustering, and putative wiring. For multimodal datasets, BrAVe establishes spatially resolved correspondence across modalities within a common reference space, allowing the identification of molecularly defined neurons and the discovery of functionally associated circuits. BrAVe further bridges scales by matching neuronal reconstructions from light microscopy (LM) and electron microscopy (EM), enabling assignment of LM neuronal types for EM datasets, and leveraging EM synaptic connectivity to refine mesoscale wiring. Additional features include 3D image registration, scalable client-server data handling, and export of static and animated outputs. Combined with its intuitive interface and species compatibility, BrAVe offers a unified solution for integrative analysis of brain atlas datasets and empowers data-driven discovery in neuroscience research.",

      "title": "Trait motivation is associated with Fusiform face area Morphometry Evidence from a Chinese Youth Sample",
      "content": "Trait motivation is fundamental in shaping human behaviors. Previous studies have primarily focused on their impact on affective and motivational processing, with their role in perceptual processes less investigated. The present study takes face perception, a crucial and well-studied perceptual process, as a representative specimen to examine the perceptual effect of trait motivation. We investigated whether the behavioral activation system (BAS) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) were associated with structural characteristics of the inferior temporal face-selective regions as well as face recognition performance. With a sample of Chinese young adults (N = 264), voxel-based morphometry revealed that BIS scores correlated with greater gray matter volume in the fusiform face area. Further, a higher BIS score was associated with slightly better performance in face recognition. These findings provide novel evidence that trait motivation, particularly behavioral inhibition, is linked to both the structure and function of the face processing system. This underlines the intrinsic coupling between motivational and perceptual systems, blurring the presumed divide between affective and perceptual processes.",
