      "title": "Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage has distinct effects on myelinated axons in the fimbria and on behaviors related to neurodevelopmental disorders in mice.",
      "content": "The hemizygous deletion of human chromosome 22q11.2 leads to cognitive and social deficits, as well as psychiatric disorders. Constitutive deletion of Tbx1, a T-box transcription factor gene encoded within this chromosomal region, results in deficits in various cognitive and social behaviors and altered formation of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and myelinated axons in the fimbria of adult mice. Given that Tbx1 is present in neonatal stem cells and oligodendrocytes, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage contributes to behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and ultrastructural changes in myelinated axons in the fimbria. To this end, we conditionally induced Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage in PdgfrCre;Tbx1+/flox mice. This mouse line showed recombination in brain regions known to express Pdgfra. Male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice performed better in spontaneous alternation in a T-maze than wild-type littermates at 1, but not 2 months of age; otherwise, mutant and wild-type littermates were indistinguishable in neonatal ultrasonic vocalization, peripubertal and postpubertal social interaction, novel object approach, anxiety-related behaviors in an elevated plus maze, and motor activity and thigmotaxis in an inescapable open field. The fimbria of male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice showed an increase in the number of myelinated axons in a range between 300 nm and 800 nm diameter and a decrease in the myelinated axons around 1,200 nm and 1,400 nm; the thickness of myelin was unchanged across all diameters. Our findings show that Tbx1 heterozygosity in oligodendrocyte precursor cells or their progeny selectively improves spontaneous alternation and shifts the proportion of myelinated axons toward small- to medium-sized axons, suggesting that the compositional shift in axons in the fimbria induced by Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage might underlie improved cognition relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Drinking microstructure analysis of direct controls of water intake in male and female rats.",
      "content": "Measures of rodent drinking (lick) patterns are used to test how various manipulations affect fluid intake. Decades of research indicate that manipulating the satiating potency of a stimulus affects the number of licking bursts whereas manipulating the hedonic value of the solution affects the size of the licking bursts or rate of licking. This type of analysis has been largely applied to manipulations that modulate drinking that is already occurring (i.e., indirect controls or modulators of intake), but there is a dearth of studies with detailed measures of licking in response to stimuli that are primary drivers of intake (i.e., direct controls). A better understanding of licking behavior in response to direct controls of fluid intake could provide insight into how drinking is stimulated. Accordingly, we analyzed lick patterns after varying doses of primary drivers (direct controls) of intake, angiotensin II, hypertonic saline, or carbochol, in male and female rats. As expected, all treatments dose-dependently increased licks for water. Analysis of licking patterns revealed dose-related increases in burst number after treatment with all stimuli, but dose did not predict burst size or lick rate. Together with previous work on licking patterns these data suggest that direct controls of water intake are more related to processes associated with satiety than to changes in hedonic value of the consumed substance.",

      "title": "Retinal Origins of Circadian Photoregulation's Specialized Dynamic Range and Temporal Integration",
      "content": "The circadian clock allows organisms to anticipate environmental changes that are driven by the earth's rotation, and synchronizes with this cycle using ligh1. The clock extracts relevant parameters of illumination, responding selectively to intensities at twilight and above, and to the number of photons counted over an extended time window2-8. These hallmark properties are thought to manifest in the brain9. Here, we report that they emerge within specific neurons of the eye. These M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) detect light directly, using a receptor called melanopsin, and indirectly, through circuits driven by rod and cone photoreceptors10. We find that the balance of intrinsic and extrinsic drives varies widely across M1s, and the population accounts for the dynamic range of circadian photoregulation. Both singly and collectively, M1s approach the level of temporal integration observed behaviorally. The cellular and behavioral levels match when the pupillary light reflex--another M1-driven function--shapes the light that M1s receive. This work reveals how the first steps of sensory processing are precisely formatted for specific tasks. It also introduces bioluminescence-based methods for identifying photosensitive neurons without desensitization, allowing their mechanistic study under physiological conditions.",
