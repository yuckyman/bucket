      "content": "High-grade gliomas are lethal brain cancers that are powerfully regulated by glutamatergic neurons through activity-dependent paracrine factors and functional neuron-to-glioma synapses. Here, we report that serotonergic neurons promote the proliferation of high-grade gliomas throughout the brain. Serotonergic neuronal activity drives circuit-specific increases in high-grade glioma proliferation, calcium transients, and reduced survival. This growth-promoting effect is chiefly mediated by activation of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) receptor 5HT2A on glioma cells. Knock out or pharmacological blockade of 5HT2A receptors in glioma abrogated the glioma growth-promoting effects of serotonergic neuronal activity, while serotonergic psychedelic drugs robustly promote malignant cell proliferation. Gliomas alter serotonergic neuronal activity patterns, resulting in elevated serotonin release into the tumor microenvironment. Together, these findings uncover pathogenic, feed-forward interactions between serotonergic neurons and glioma cells.",

The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "Gain and loss of function changes in CACNA1C affect neuronal networks through divergent pathways",
      "content": "Background: CACNA1C encodes the pore-forming subunit of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2. Common variants in CACNA1C are associated with psychiatric disorders, while rare single-nucleotide variants cause CACNA1C-related disorder (CRD), a multi-system disorder with symptoms that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and seizures. However, the cellular mechanisms linking CACNA1C dysfunction to neurodevelopmental phenotypes remain poorly understood. Methods: We generated isogenic CACNA1C loss-of-function (LoF) induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines and reprogrammed a line from an individual carrying a novel gain-of-function (GoF) variant in CACNA1C. Neuronal activity was assessed using multi-electrode arrays (MEA), pharmacological manipulation, and gene expression analysis. Early developmental phenotypes were examined using qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing. Results: LoF and GoF patient-derived neurons displayed opposing alterations in network dynamics. Pharmacological and molecular assays indicated that these network differences were associated with dysregulated GABAergic signalling. Early developmental analysis revealed that loss of CACNA1C altered rosette morphology, CREB phosphorylation, and transcriptional programs related to axonogenesis and synaptic signalling, indicating effects on neuronal differentiation. The patient line exhibited opposing phenotypes, reflecting variant-specific effects. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that Cav1.2 regulates excitatory-inhibitory balance, network organization, and aspects of neurodevelopment. Divergent effects of LoF and GoF variants highlight how altered Cav1.2 signalling contributes to variable neurodevelopmental phenotypes, including ASD and epilepsy, and establish a framework for defining CACNA1C variant effects in human neurons.",

      "title": "A theory of multi-task computation and task selection",
      "content": "Neural activity during the performance of a stereotyped behavioral task is often described as low-dimensional, occupying only a limited region in the space of all firing-rate patterns. This region has been referred to as the \"neural manifold\" associated with a task. More recently, recordings of neural activity in animals challenged to perform multiple tasks have suggested that each task is associated with a different low-dimensional manifold. What connectivity structures underlie this flexibility in neural dynamics, and how is interference between the dynamics associated with different tasks avoided? We develop a theoretical model for multi-task computation in nonlinear recurrent neural networks whose connectivity is constructed as a weighted sum of many low-rank components, each encoding the dynamics associated with a different task. The model demonstrates that interference between different tasks' dynamics limits flexible multi-tasking and can lead to chaotic fluctuations. However, small modulations of a network's effective connectivity overcome this interference. We derive the conditions that enable such task selection and characterize both single-neuron and population statistics in task-selected and unselected states. The model reveals the requirements for a single network to produce distinct dynamics confined to distinct neural manifolds and suggests circuit mechanisms that support this capability. Using the model, we propose different hypotheses for explaining the origin of high-dimensional neural activity in large-scale recordings.",

      "title": "Title: You Are What You Sync: Neural Synchronization Predicts Religious Affiliation",
      "content": "Existing research has found that shared neural responses to naturalistic narratives are associated with shared understanding, especially within the same social group. In this fMRI study, we tested whether in-group neural synchronization reflects only explicit shared understandings or also relates to other group characteristics. We compared synchronization patterns in two distinct social groups: Religious (N = 21) and Secular (N = 21). Participants were scanned while watching short video clips with religious or neutral content and then answered questions about their reactions and interpretations. Behavioral results did not reveal group differences in the homogeneity of responses: neither in engagement and agreement while watching the videos, nor in the emotions and verbal reactions elicited by them. However, neuroimaging revealed strikingly higher in-group synchronization among Religious participants than among Secular participants, across both religious and neutral narratives. Remarkably, it was possible to predict the religious affiliation of each participant solely from in-group neural synchrony, with accuracy up to 92%. This pattern was consistent across all neural networks, most prominently in the Default Mode Network (DMN), Control, and Attention networks. It also emerged in the Salience network and Somatomotor regions, hinting at neural processes that may foster group cohesion and identification. We propose that increased neural synchrony in the Religious group is driven mainly by a more homogeneous social structure, suggesting a novel perspective on the role of neural synchrony in group dynamics.",

      "title": "Speaker Identity is Robustly Encoded in Spatial Patterns of Intracranial EEG for Attention Decoding",
      "content": "The human auditory cortex robustly tracks attended speech, yet it remains unclear if speaker identity is encoded in spatial patterns of neural activity independent of temporal dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that the identity of an attended speaker is reliably reflected in distinct, time-invariant spatial activation maps in human intracranial EEG (iEEG). Leveraging these \"neural fingerprints\", we developed a novel framework for Auditory Attention Decoding (AAD) that shifts from traditional temporal envelope tracking to spatial speaker identification. By decoupling the decoding of \"who\" is speaking from \"when\" they are speaking, our modular system achieves state-of-the-art speech extraction, particularly in short time windows (<2 seconds) where temporal models typically fail. Furthermore, we observed a reciprocal shift in neural activity during attentional switches, confirming that these spatial codes dynamically track listener intent. These findings establish that speaker identity is a robust, spatially distributed feature in the auditory cortex, offering a high-speed, complementary mechanism for neuro-steered hearing technologies.",
