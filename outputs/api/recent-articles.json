      "title": "A map of the cortical functional network mediating naturalistic navigation",
      "content": "Navigation through the real world requires close coordination of perception, planning, and motor actions. Prior neuroimaging studies that used controlled stimuli and tasks have suggested that navigation-related information is represented broadly across the human cerebral cortex. While three regions in the anterior visual cortex have been well-studied, the extent and functional properties of regions in the parietal and prefrontal cortices are not as well-characterized. To map and characterize the full cortical network that underpins active navigation in the real world, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record brain activity from participants performing a naturalistic navigation task. Banded ridge regression was used to fit high-dimensional encoding models for 28,134 features to this data. Results show that naturalistic navigation is supported by a network of 11 functionally distinct cortical regions: five prefrontal and three parietal regions, along with three regions in the visual cortex that had been identified and characterized in previous studies. Analysis of encoding model weights shows that these 11 regions transform perceptual inputs through decision-making processes to produce action outputs, and are organized along distributed cortical functional gradients. These results provide a unified description of the functional properties and organization of the cortical network that mediates naturalistic navigation. We anticipate that these maps will provide rich targets to inform more targeted future studies of human navigation.",

      "title": "Verbal versus Nonverbal Processing Leads to Generalized Hemispheric Laterality Effects that Span Multiple Networks",
      "content": "Precision neuroimaging was used to explore specialization for verbal versus nonverbal processing. Consistent with prior findings, individuals exhibited a spatially left-lateralized association language network, with regions in both hemispheres robustly responding to processing of meaning-based sentences. We next examined differential responses to verbal (words) versus nonverbal (faces) materials within the same working memory task. The right hemisphere components of the language network responded more strongly to nonverbal than to verbal materials, splitting the network's functional profile between the hemispheres. Similar patterns were observed across multiple association networks including putative cognitive-control, action-mode, and attention networks. The hemispheric laterality effect was prospectively replicated in a second independent study. These findings highlight a generalized laterality phenomenon that transcends individual specialized networks and aligns with a broad mechanism that modulates processing between the hemispheres.",

      "content": "Understanding how the human brain develops and functions requires direct analysis of human cells. Single-cell atlases open unprecedented opportunities to survey cell physiological molecular states as the brain develops. However, technical challenges limit their potential. We present NeuRoDev, a computational resource with highly curated transcriptomic data and novel analytical tools to investigate neuronal and glial development in the human cortex. NeuRoDev compresses ~1M single-cell transcriptomes into integrative summary networks of reproducible cell clusters that capture temporal and cellular variation across all stages of human brain development. It provides a reference framework to directly interrogate cellular maturation dynamics, contextualize gene function, and interpret experimental organoid models. We use NeuRoDev to investigate developmental variation in cell physiology, reconstruct genesis and maturation dynamics in neuronal and glial cells, and interpret time-series data from organoid models. NeuRoDev is provided as a freely available software package and as web applications for interactive data analysis.",

      "title": "Bidirectional Crosstalk Between the SAGA Complex Deubiquitinase Module and the Molecular Circadian Clock",
      "content": "The Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex is a highly conserved chromatin-modifying transcriptional coactivator that regulates gene expression through both transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. In addition to histone acetyltransferase activity, SAGA harbors a deubiquitinase module (DUBm) that influences protein stability, localization, and function by removal of ubiquitin. Although SAGAs roles in transcription are well characterized, how its enzymatic modules are dynamically regulated to coordinate its divergent activities remains less known. Here, we identify a bidirectional relationship between the molecular circadian clock and the SAGA DUBm. Our results indicate that circadian rhythms influence DUBm activities and expression, while the DUBm in turn shapes the timing and stability of core clock proteins and transcripts, positioning the DUBm as an important mediator of the molecular circadian clock.",

      "title": "Connectome Similarity Varies with Global Metastability and Movie Content",
      "content": "Introduction: Recent evidence supports that non-linear segments of brain activity carries most of the individual-specific information which allows unique identification based on functional connectomes (e.g. connectome fingerprints) in MEG. In fMRI, metastability has emerged as a reliable and robust summary measure of brain dynamics. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that metastability is associated with connectome fingerprinting in naturalistic fMRI. We further examined whether this putative association varies with time scales, across brain functional networks, and depending on the movie content. Methods: We analyzed fMRI data from 86 participants of the Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database. Data was collected during movie-watching of 10 entire movies of different genres. Global and network-level metastability were calculated using an fMRI-appropriate proxy measure based on the variability of spatial coherence. The within-subject stability (Iself) and between-subjects similarity (Iothers) of individual functional connectomes were also calculated. Linear mixed-effects models and appropriate contrasts were used to test associations between metastability and fingerprinting indices. Results: At the whole-brain level and considering data from all movies, an association across windows was found between metastability, Iself, and Iothers, with stronger effects observed for larger windows, such as the 600-second window (Iself: b = -0.13, SE = 0.032, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.23, SE = 0.028, p < 0.001). Associations were also observed with distinct magnitudes within the eight large-scale functional networks, with particularly strong effects in the Motor Network (Iself: b = -0.34, SE = 0.027, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.27, SE = 0.021, p < 0.001). Although no whole-brain differences were observed, movie content exhibited distinct association patterns within networks, notably for the prediction of Iself in the Visual Network for 500 Days of Summer ({Delta} = -0.22, SE = 0.11, p = 0.043). For Iothers, significant between-movie differences were found in the AMN ({Delta} = -0.25, SE = 0.062, p < 0.001), Dorsal Attention ({Delta} = 0.16, SE = 0.08, p = 0.038), Ventral Attention ({Delta} = 0.14, SE = 0.060, p = 0.017), and Visual Networks ({Delta} = -0.17, SE = 0.081, p = 0.031). Conclusion: Metastability is systematically related to functional connectome fingerprints. This relationship is time-scale dependent, varies across functional networks, and is sensitive to movie content. Our findings bridge nonlinear brain dynamics and connectome identifiability, highlighting naturalistic paradigms as a powerful framework for individualized precision neuroimaging.",

      "title": "Gasdermin E couples mitochondrial damage to pyroptotic neurodegeneration in Parkinson disease",
      "content": "Parkinson disease (PD) features progressive loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, but how mitochondrial damage engages programmed cell death pathways remains unresolved. Here, we identify gasdermin E (GSDME), the caspase-3-activated executor of pyroptosis, as a critical mediator of neurodegeneration in toxin-based PD models. In primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells, the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPTP/MPP triggered caspase-3 activation, GSDME cleavage, and lytic membrane rupture. Genetic silencing of Gsdme or its transcriptional regulator SP1 reduced neuronal death. In vivo, Gsdme deficiency preserved substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, improved motor performance, and mitigated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after MPTP administration. Loss of Gsdme also dampened microglial and astrocytic activation and lowered proinflammatory cytokines in striatum and substantia nigra. Mechanistically, cleaved GSDME localized to mitochondria, disrupted membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, and precipitated organelle injury, thereby coupling mitochondrial dysfunction to pyroptotic cell death. These findings identify GSDME-mediated pyroptosis as a mechanistic link between mitochondrial toxicity and neuroinflammation in PD and nominate GSDME as a therapeutic entry point to slow disease progression.",

      "title": "SynSpine: an automated workflow for the generation of longitudinal spinal cord synthetic MRI data",
      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",

      "title": "Comparison of contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities",
      "content": "IntroductionThe purpose of the study was to investigate potential differences in contralateral muscle excitation in proximal versus distal muscles in the upper extremities. Based on the different neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints in the central part of the neural system for proximal and distal muscles, it was hypothesized that contralateral muscle excitation (CME) would be higher for proximal than distal muscles.MethodsThirteen university students participated in this study. The participants performed isometric flexion movements with the shoulder and index finger of the dominant arm at four different relative force levels (25, 50, 75, 100%). Force was measured with a force transducer connected to the index finger and elbow on the dominant arm. Muscle excitation was measured using sEMG placed on the flexor carpi radialis (distal condition) and the anterior deltoid (proximal condition) on the non-dominant arm.ResultsCME was observed in both proximal and distal muscles, with proximal muscles displaying significantly higher CME at higher force levels (50, 75, and 100%). In the proximal condition, contractions with the dominant anterior deltoid were associated with a progressive increase in CME across force levels in the contralateral homologous muscle. In contrast, for the distal condition (flexor carpi radialis), CME changes were only evident when comparing the lowest and highest force levels.ConclusionThe results are in coherence with the differences in neuroanatomical and neurophysiological constraints for bilateral communication for proximal versus distal muscles. The present results encourage further neurophysiological studies using direct brain activity measures to explore the potential link between the differences in bilateral communication and CME for proximal versus distal muscles.",

      "title": "Identification of cognitive predictors of remission in depression following limited effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on hot and cold cognitive systems",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive dysfunction is a chronic and debilitating element of major depressive disorder (MDD), which manifests as abnormal processing in hot (emotion-laden) and cold (emotion-independent) cognitive systems. Although the antidepressant properties of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are well-established, its impact on hot and cold cognition requires further elucidation.MethodsProspective study of patients with MDD undergoing an acute course of high frequency rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC). MDD patients (N\u202f=\u202f24) received a 4-to-6-week course of rTMS during which they were evaluated for depressive symptoms and completed cognitive assessments. Age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls (N\u202f=\u202f33) also completed the cognitive tasks at the same intervals as the MDD patients.ResultsSustained antidepressant effect was observed following rTMS in MDD patients. Hot and cold cognition remained unaltered over the course of treatment. A pre-treatment baseline cognitive phenotype of those who achieve remission of their depressive symptoms with rTMS was identified, characterized by greater sustained attention, speed in correct identification of facial expressions, and free recall of words.ConclusionOur findings further validate the cognitive safety and clinical efficacy of rTMS as an intervention for MDD. Future research is required to further characterize the utility of pre-rTMS cognitive phenotyping in identified remitters, to aid in patient selection and treatment prognostication.",

      "title": "Altering visual feedback during reaching: no mitigating effect on pain for individuals with complex regional pain syndrome, but visuomotor adaptation is preserved",
      "content": "IntroductionComplex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is often associated with pain-related fear of movement, and virtual reality has been proposed as a potential rehabilitation intervention to overcome this issue. Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to test whether altering the visual feedback (VF) on movement could mitigate pain and promote movement.MethodsFifteen participants with upper-limb CRPS and 15 age- and gender-matched pain-free participants undertook a target reaching task in the Kinarm exoskeleton, with two VF conditions being tested (Per Exposure: GREATER or SMALLER VF; two separate sessions), preceded and followed by reaching movements without VF (Pre-/Post-Exposure). Proprioception was assessed with a Limb Position Sense task, and a Movement Accuracy outcome was derived from the Pre-Exposure reaching movements.ResultsContrary to our hypothesis, pain intensity was not influenced by VF conditions but increased over Time (p < 0.001). Analyses performed on kinematics data showed that participants displayed visuomotor adaptation both Per Exposure, and Pre-/Post-Exposure to altered VF (VF condition*Time: p < 0.001). Per Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants tended to adapt their Movement Length to a lesser extent than pain-free participants (Group*VF condition: p = 0.048). Pre-/Post-Exposure analyses revealed that CRPS participants consistently performed larger movements than pain-free participants (p = 0.002). Both groups performed similarly for the Limb Position Sense task, but CRPS participants displayed significantly larger errors for Movement Accuracy, suggesting impaired proprioceptive integration in the CRPS group.DiscussionThese findings support the idea that visuomotor adaptation is preserved in CRPS and can be used to promote movement.",

      "content": "BackgroundMultifocal transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) has emerged as an innovative approach for modulating cognitive functions by concurrently targeting multiple brain regions. Despite its potential, the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of this technique remain unclear.ObjectiveTo evaluate the efficacy of multifocal tES in enhancing cognitive function by examining targeted brain regions, stimulation protocols, and behavioral and neurophysiological outcomes.MethodsA systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted up to February 10, 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. The inclusion criteria encompassed human studies utilizing concurrent dual-site or multifocal tES with pre- and post-intervention behavioral assessments. Studies on deep brain stimulation, corticocortical paired associative stimulation, sequential stimulation, case reports, and reviews were excluded.ResultsOf the 1,453 initial records, 14 met the inclusion criteria. The studies predominantly employed transcranial direct current stimulation/transcranial alternating current stimulation, targeting the frontoparietal network. Neurophysiological data from electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed network-level modulations. Behavioral outcomes were inconsistent, with some studies reporting improvements in executive function, working memory, and response inhibition, whereas others showed no significant advantages over sham stimulation.ConclusionAlthough multifocal tES is a promising modality, clearly determining its efficacy is currently limited by heterogeneous study designs, small sample sizes, and conflicting findings. Future research should prioritize multi-arm trials, incorporate neurophysiological biomarkers, and develop personalized stimulation protocols to optimize the effectiveness of this technique.Trial registrationPROSPERO Registration # CRD420250646196.",

      "title": "Perceptual learning improves spatial contrast sensitivity in older adults",
      "content": "IntroductionWidespread visual deficits accompany normal aging, with most attributed to functional degradation of the visual cortex. Although perceptual learning can improve many visual functions in older adults, it remains unclear whether it can enhance spatial contrast sensitivity, a fundamental visual function known to decline significantly from around age forty.MethodsTo address this, we trained 29 older adults and 18 young controls using contrast perceptual learning. Training was conducted at seven spatial frequencies (from low to high) and/or at the individual cut-off spatial frequency. Spatial contrast sensitivity function (SCSF) and visual acuity (VA) were measured before and after training.ResultsTraining induced substantial improvements in both SCSF and VA in older adults, which were retained for at least several months. Analysis of transfer effects revealed that, compared to young controls, older adults exhibited a characteristic low-frequency shift in peak improvement and a slightly broader bandwidth.DiscussionThese results may be associated with age-related alterations in neuronal response properties within the primary visual cortex. Our findings demonstrate substantial neural plasticity in the aging visual system and support the potential of perceptual learning as a clinically viable intervention for mitigating age-related visual decline.",

      "title": "Contribution of binocular visual function and its impairment by Bangerter foils to the performance of a precision reaching, grasping and placing task in healthy adults",
      "content": "BackgroundUpper limb movement execution is affected in patients with vision impairments resulting from ocular pathologies or binocular anomalies. Deficits in motor performance have been correlated with reduced contrast sensitivity, phoria, and stereoacuity.AimTo evaluate the effects of increased straylight induced by Bangerter foils on binocular visual function and examine the corresponding impact on eye-hand kinematics during a high precision reaching, grasping and placement task (i.e., bead threading).MethodsTwenty-one healthy participants, aged 21\u201341\u202fyears, participated in this experimental study. Visual function assessment included visual acuity (VA), contrast sensitivity (CS), stereoacuity (SA), phoria, and fusional vergences (FV). Vision was impaired experimentally using Bangerter foils 0.4. Participants performed a bead threading task under three randomized viewing conditions: binocular baseline (BB; normal vision), binocular viewing with a foil over the dominant eye (FDE), and foils over both eyes (FBE). Eye and hand movements were recorded using an eye tracker and a motion capture camera.ResultsVisual functions (VA, CS, and stereoacuity) were impaired when viewing with the Bangerter foils. Pairwise comparison between viewing conditions confirmed statistically significant differences between BB, FDE and FBE for mid to high spatial frequencies (6, 12 and 18\u202fcycles per degree; p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Break points for positive and negative fusional reserves were impaired when interocular differences increased (i.e., FDE condition). The impairment did not have any impact on phoria. Results from the kinematic analysis revealed threading duration was prolonged using Bangerter foils on both eyes (FBE condition). In contrast to the hypothesis, visual deficit due to foils did not affect any other kinematic measures. However, results from mixed model analyses revealed that individual differences in phoria and fusional vergence had the most significant influence on reaching performance. Specifically, a larger exophoria magnitude was associated with longer reach duration, lower peak velocity and prolonged total time to complete the task (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionInducing short-term deterioration through the alteration of contrast sensitivity at high spatial frequencies without a clinical deterioration in stereopsis does not have a significant impact on precision grasping and placing movements, in a repetitive manual task. Notably, this study demonstrated that phoria impacts the execution of reaching movements.",
