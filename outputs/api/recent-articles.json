      "title": "Echoes as Signal, Not Noise: Reverberation Sharpens Sensitivity to Temporal Structure",
      "content": "Sensitivity to temporal structure is fundamental to hearing, yet how natural reverberation shapes this sensitivity is unclear. Here we identify a general principle we term echo-facilitated temporal sensitivity (EFTS), in which the auditory system exploits reverberation as a computational resource to selectively and dose dependently enhance perceptual and neural responses to rapid temporal changes. Using transitional click trains with subtle inter click interval (ICI) shifts, human listeners showed monotonically improved change detection across simulated echo levels. Concurrent EEG revealed systematic increases of a late change response with echo strength, while onset responses remained stable, indicating a selective boost to temporal-structure-transition processing. In awake rats, electrocorticography over auditory cortex replicated these effects; single units exhibited echo level dependent increases in ICI transition evoked firing, and receiver operating characteristic neurometrics yielded steeper functions and lower discrimination thresholds. Laminar local field potential analysis further revealed that echo-dependent divergence emerged last in the supragranular layer, after appearing in the granular and infragranular layers, consistent with an initial thalamocortical drive followed by intracortical amplification. Together, these findings establish EFTS as a cross-species mechanism for ecologically grounded temporal computation, through which reverberation sharpens neural representations of temporal structure and enhances sensitivity to rapid pattern changes, reframing echoes as structured signals that the brain uses to naturally optimize temporal integration in everyday listening.",

      "title": "Infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) modulation of human brain pulsations in awake and sleep states",
      "content": "Human brain exhibits three propagating pulsations, namely cardiovascular, respiratory, and vasomotor waves, which together propel the flow of intracranial fluids. While their pulsation characteristics have been extensively studied, their causal interconnections have not been systematically investigated. Using ultrafast whole brain magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), we analysed the frequency domain up to 5 Hz for cross-frequency oscillatory interactions in awake and NREM-sleep states of 23 healthy volunteers. Using transfer entropy (TE) analysis, we found that in the awake state the infra-slow (ISF < 0.1 Hz) oscillations of statistically independent resting state networks (RSN) largely drove the neurofluid (NF) pulsatility. NREM-sleep was associated with increased power of infra-slow fluctuation (ISF) vasomotor oscillations and with altered driving patterns between RSN and NF networks in the direction of a causally chained pattern. Importantly, within these independent signal sources, we found three distinct cross-frequency coupling frequency ranges occurring at ISF (<0.1 Hz), respiratory (~0.25 Hz), and cardiovascular (~1 Hz) frequencies, where the slower pulsations generally modulated the faster ones, except for a finding of inverted cardiorespiratory drive in NREM-2 sleep. These results indicate the presence of directional ISF-coordinated mechanisms underlying brain pulsations that contribute to driving the intracranial fluid transfer processes.",
