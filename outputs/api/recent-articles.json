      "title": "Electro-Calcium uncoupling precedes neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease",
      "content": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is categorized as a neurodegenerative disease, but there is a growing recognition of the vascular components in AD pathophysiology. Reduction in cerebral perfusion is routinely observed in AD patients and preclinical models prior to overt clinical symptoms. However, there is a limited mechanistic understanding of the early neurovascular deficits in AD, and how these may ultimately contribute to pathology. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of early neurovascular dysfunction in AD by using 3-month-old 5xFAD mice, a familial mouse model of AD. Functional hyperemia-the increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to neuronal activity-is driven by inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1)-mediated hyperpolarizing (electrical) signals and Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide production within the capillary endothelial cells (cECs). Electrical and Ca2+ signals are tightly coupled through cECs membrane potential, referred to as Electro-Calcium (E- Ca) coupling. We hypothesize that E-Ca uncoupling contributes to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and that these neurovascular deficits precede the neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. At three months of age, 5xFAD mice did not exhibit any impairment in spatial learning and memory, or neuronal density. However, whisker stimulation-induced functional hyperemia was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice compared to controls. Functional hyperemia exhibited a bimodal response in controls-consisting of fast and slow phases-with the slow phase being significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. To identify mechanisms underlying these deficits, we measured cortical neuronal and endothelial Ca2+ activity using in-vivo imaging. Neuronal Ca2+ activity was comparable between controls and 5xFAD mice, while cECs Ca2+ activity was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice. Moreover, Kir2.1 channel blocker, barium (100 M) significantly suppressed cECs Ca2+ activity in controls, but not in 5xFAD mice, consistent with crippled E-Ca coupling. Despite these vascular functional impairments, capillary density was preserved in 5xFAD mice. TRPV4 channels are one of the major Ca2+ entry pathways in cECs and potentiate E-Ca coupling. cECs TRPV4 current density was significantly reduced in 5xFAD mice while Kir2.1 current density was unchanged, indicating that impaired TRPV4 function underlies the E-Ca uncoupling. In summary, early E-Ca uncoupling leads to impaired functional hyperemia in 5xFAD mice and may contribute to later neuronal and cognitive decline.",

      "title": "Translational regulation of GAD1 identified by circadian and light-responsive ribosome-bound transcriptome analysis in the mouse hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus",
      "content": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the master circadian pacemaker, integrating photic information to synchronize daily rhythms throughout the body. While transcriptional regulation of clock genes in the SCN has been extensively studied, whether gene expression in the SCN is regulated at the level of mRNA translation has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report the first ribosome-profiling (Ribo-seq) dataset generated from the mouse SCN, enabling a genome-wide assessment of translational regulation in this central circadian clock. Combined time-series Ribo-seq and RNA-seq analyses identified 385 genes that exhibit rhythmic ribosome binding without corresponding oscillations in mRNA abundance, revealing widespread translational regulation in the SCN. Among these, light stimulation induced an approximately twofold increase in ribosome binding of Gad1, which encodes the major GABA-synthetic enzyme Gad67, despite only marginal changes in Gad1 mRNA levels. Importantly, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated light-dependent accumulation of Gad67 protein selectively in light-activated SCN neurons, establishing that translational regulation of Gad1 gives rise to overt protein-level changes. In contrast, canonical clock genes were regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level and showed little evidence of translational modulation. Our data allow a systematic comparison between transcriptionally and translationally regulated genes, including their relative rhythm-amplitudes and phases, and thereby revealed translational control as a distinct modulatory layer shaping time-of-day-dependent and light-dependent gene expression in the SCN.",

      "title": "The impact of dynamic reversal potential on the evolution of action potential attributes during spike trains",
      "content": "Action potentials (AP) are the basic elements of information processing in the nervous system. Understanding AP generation mechanisms is a critical step to understand how neurons encode information. However, an individual neuron might fire APs with various shapes even in response to the same stimulus, and the mechanisms responsible for this variability remain unclear. Therefore, we analyzed four AP attributes including AP rapidity and threshold during consecutive bursts from three neuron types using intracellular electrophysiological recordings. In response to consecutive current steps, the AP attributes in evoked spike trains show two distinctive patterns across different neurons: (1) The first APs from each train always have comparable properties regardless of the stimulus strength; (2) The attributes of the subsequent APs during each pulse monotonically change during the burst, where the magnitude of AP attribute change during each pulse increases with increasing stimulation strength. Various conductance-based models were explored to determine if they replicated the observed AP bursts. The observed patterns could not be replicated using the classical HH-type models, or modified HH model with cooperative Na+ gating. However, adding ion concentration dynamics to the model reproduced the AP attribute variation, and the magnitude of change during a pulse correlated with change in dynamic reversal potential (DRP), but failed to replicate the first AP attributes pattern. Then, the role of cooperative Na+ gating on neuronal firing dynamics was investigated. Inclusion of cooperative gating restored the first APs\u2019 attributes and enhanced the magnitude of modeled variation of some AP attributes to better agree with observed data. We conclude that changes in local ion concentrations could be responsible for the monotonic change in APs attributes during neuronal bursts, and cooperative gating of Na+ channels can enhance the effect. Thus, the two mechanisms could contribute to the observed variability in neuronal response.",

      "title": "IAP-TransUNet: integration of the attention mechanism and pyramid pooling for medical image segmentation",
      "content": "IntroductionThe combination of CNN and Transformer has attracted much attention for medical image segmentation due to its superior performance at present. However, the segmentation performance is affected by limitations such as the local receptive field and static weights of CNN convolution operations, as well as insufficient information exchange between Transformer local regions.MethodsTo address these issues, an integrated attention mechanism and pyramid pooling network is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an efficient channel attention mechanism is embedded into CNN to extract more comprehensive image features. Then, CBAM_ASPP module is introduced into the bottleneck layer to obtain multi-scale context information. Finally, in order to address the limitations of traditional convolution, depthwise separable convolution is used to achieve a lightweight network.ResultsThe experiments based on the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset and ACDC dataset showed that the proposed IAP-TransUNet achieved Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) of 78.85% and 90.46%, respectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, for the Synapse multi organ segmentation dataset, the Hausdorff distance was reduced by 2.92%. For the ACDC dataset, the segmentation accuracy of the left ventricle, myocardium, and right ventricle was improved by 0.14%, 1.89%, and 0.23%, respectively.DiscussionThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network has improved the effectiveness and shows strong performance on both CT and MRI data, which suggests its potential for generalization across different medical imaging modalities.",

      "content": "Motor imagery brain\u2013computer interface (MI-BCI) has garnered considerable attention due to its potential for neural plasticity. However, the limited number of MI-EEG samples per subject and the susceptibility of features to noise and artifacts posed significant challenges for achieving high decoding performance. To address this problem, a Data-Augmented Multi-Scale Temporal Attention Convolutional Network (AMANet) was proposed. The network mainly consisted of four modules. First, the data augmentation module comprises three steps: sliding-window segmentation to increase sample size, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) extraction of discriminative spatial features, and linear scaling to enhance network robustness. Then, multi-scale temporal convolution was incorporated to dynamically extract temporal and spatial features. Subsequently, the ECA attention mechanism was integrated to realize the adaptive adjustment of the weights of different channels. Finally, depthwise separable convolution was utilized to fully integrate and classify the deep extraction of temporal and spatial features. In 10-fold cross-validation, the results show that AMANet achieves classification accuracies of 84.06 and 85.09% on the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b, respectively, significantly outperforming baseline models such as Incep-EEGNet. On the High-Gamma dataset, AMANet attains a classification accuracy of 95.48%. These results demonstrate the excellent performance of AMANet in motor imagery decoding tasks.",

      "title": "Methodological optimization for eliciting robust median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials for realtime single trial applications",
      "content": "Objective. Single-trial measurement of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) with noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) is challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), limiting its use in real-time neurorehabilitation applications. We describe and evaluate methodological optimizations for eliciting reliable median nerve SEPs measurable in real time, with reduced reliance on post-processing. Methods. In twelve healthy participants, two sessions each, SEPs were assessed at three pulse widths (0.1, 0.5, 1 ms), at a low-frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz \u00b1 10%), and at an intensity sufficient to evoke consistent and robust sensory nerve action potentials and compound muscle action potentials. The evoked potential operant conditioning system platform was used to monitor responses in real time. Feasibility was also evaluated in a participant with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). Results. SEP P50 and N70 were reliably elicited in healthy participants, and in individual with iSCI, across all tested pulse widths with minimal discomfort. N70 amplitude increased significantly with pulse width ( = 17.64, p = 0.0001, w = 0.80), while P50 amplitude remained unchanged. SNR showed a significant pulse width-dependent increase ( = 7.82, p = 0.02, w = 0.35) with improvements of 40% and 52% at 0.5 and 1 ms, respectively. N70 single-trial separability significantly improved at 1 ms (AUC of 0.83, = 8.17, p= 0.017), including the iSCI participant (0.84\u2013less impaired hand, 0.79\u2013more impaired hand). Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.70\u20130.84, p < 0.05) was highest at 0.5 ms, indicating more consistent N70 and P50 measurements across sessions at a longer pulse width. Significance. Robust median nerve SEPs can be measured at single trials with methodological optimizations such as a longer pulse width (0.5\u20131 ms), low frequency (0.5 Hz), a consistent afferent excitation guided by nerve and muscle responses, and a robust EEG acquisition system. This setup can be useful for real time SEP-based brain computer interface applications for rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "content": "Objective: This article aimed to examine the psychometric properties of a measure of youth fear-avoidance of concussive symptoms. Method: Fear-avoidance is thought to be a risk factor for prolonged concussion recovery; however, current measures of fear-avoidance focus on pain rather than broader symptoms. We adapted the Fear of Pain Questionnaire to be relevant to concussion symptoms with a new version called the Fear of Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (FOCSQ). We assessed the psychometrics of this scale with a sample of <em>N</em> = 115 youth with persistent postconcussive symptoms (<em>M</em><sub>age</sub> = 15.1 years, 58% female, 70% non-Hispanic White, 15% Hispanic, <em>M</em> = 79.2 days since injury), including reliability, construct validity, and cross-informant reliability. Results: Exploratory factor analysis suggested a two-factor model was a good fit for youth report (fear and avoidance) and a three-factor model for parent proxy (fear, school/social avoidance, and movement avoidance). Reliability was excellent, with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for both youth report and parent proxy of 0.93 (95% CI [0.91, 0.95]). Construct validity indicated moderate correlation between youth-report FOCSQ and concussive symptoms 0.55 (95% CI [0.41, 0.66]), headache severity 0.37 (95% CI [0.19, 0.53]), depression 0.62 (95% CI [0.49, 0.72]), and anxiety 0.64 (95% CI [0.51, 0.73]). Criterion-related validity was supported by an inverse correlation between FOCSQ and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory: \u22120.64 (95% CI [\u22120.74, \u22120.52]). Youth report and parent proxy were moderately correlated, with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient <em>r</em> = 0.60 (95% CI [0.47, 0.71]). Conclusions: The FOCSQ is a reliable and valid measure of fear-avoidance in youth with concussion, and future research might explore whether this measure could be used to identify youth at risk for prolonged recovery.

      "title": "Phonological networks remain intact in multiple sclerosis.",
      "content": "Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition characterized by white and gray matter decline that leads to slower motor function and cognitive impairment. Although language remains relatively intact, individuals with MS often have word retrieval difficulties. Previous research suggests that these difficulties may be related to vocabulary, the number of words an individual knows, and other semantic aspects of language. However, few studies have examined phonological aspects of speech. Method: We examined speech in 89 individuals with MS and 88 age-matched neurotypical adults using a phonemic verbal fluency task. We took a network science approach, building a phonological network from participants\u2019 responses and their close phonological neighbors. We then examined the local network characteristics (degree, clustering coefficient) of participants\u2019 responses to assess whether responses differed between the groups. Results: Although individuals with MS produced fewer responses during the task, the network characteristics of their responses were similar to neurotypical adults, the control group. Moreover, lexical characteristics such as word length and lexical frequency were also similar between groups (model <em>R</em>\u00b2 values < 1%). Finally, a forward flow analysis, which quantifies the phonological similarity between adjacent responses and provides a metric of how people search phonemic space, did not differ between groups. Conclusions: Overall, these results suggest that phonological aspects of speech remain stable in individuals with MS. Word retrieval difficulties in MS may arise from neurological changes in semantic processes, in combination with other cognitive abilities such as speed of processing and executive function, which are common in MS.

      "title": "Pathological TDP-43 filaments accumulate at synapses and cause synaptic dysfunction",
      "content": "The assembly of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) into amyloid filaments within neurons is a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including motor neuron diseases (MND), frontotemporal dementias (FTD) and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). These diseases result from the deterioration and loss of neurons, with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal hyperexcitability being prominent early events. Pathogenic mutations in the TDP-43 gene, TARDBP, that promote filament formation have established a causal role for TDP-43 assembly in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying filament accumulation and their contribution to neurodegeneration are poorly understood. TDP-43 filaments can propagate between neurons in a prion-like manner, which may underlie the progressive spread and accumulation of TDP-43 pathology in disease. Here, we studied early stages of TDP-43 filament accumulation following internalisation of patient-derived TDP-43 filaments by mouse and human cortical neurons. Using proximity labelling, we identified molecular environments and putative interactions of TDP-43 filaments. We found that TDP-43 filaments accumulated at synapses, particularly in proximity to the presynaptic active zone, which we confirmed in FTD patient brain sections. Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) directly visualised abundant TDP-43 filaments spanning the presynaptic cytoplasm in situ, which contacted synaptic vesicles and the plasma membrane. Functional measurements revealed that the accumulation of TDP-43 filaments led to presynaptic dysfunction and subsequent neuronal hyperexcitability. These findings suggest that synapses are a major early site of TDP-43 filament accumulation, relevant to their propagation, and directly link TDP-43 filament gain of function to synaptic dysfunction.",

      "title": "Cerebellar Gray Matter Volume Changes Across Development: Posterolateral and Vermal Transient Increases during Adolescence",
      "content": "The cerebellum undergoes substantial maturation with regionally distinct developmental trajectories. This study examined cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) in healthy children, adolescents, and adults, using voxel-based morphometry, the ACAPULCO algorithm, and the SUIT toolbox for cerebellum-optimized analyses. A total of 104 typically developing children (n=31, 6-9 years), adolescents (n=35, 13-17 years), and adults (n=38, 30-40 years) were included. We hypothesized age group differences in cerebellar GMV, with adolescents showing the greatest volume, specifically in posterolateral regions. Results revealed significant group differences in GMV. We observed region-specific volumetric patterns, with some areas (e.g., Crus II, lobule X) increasing from childhood to adolescence followed by stabilization, whereas other areas (e.g., lobules I-IV and VI, Crus I, vermis VI and VIIb) exhibited peak GMV during adolescence, with lower volumes in both children and adults. These patterns were partly consistent with our hypothesis. Notably, no regions had greater GMV in adults than adolescents, suggesting that cerebellar growth peaks in adolescence before stabilizing. Our findings indicate differential developmental patterns both between and within lobules of the cerebellum, and highlight adolescence as a peak period of cerebellar growth, with potential implications for the development of cerebellar-supported cognitive and emotional functions that undergo significant changes during this period.",
