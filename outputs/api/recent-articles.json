      "title": "REST/NRSF phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates its transcriptional repressor activity and half-life",
      "content": "REST is a repressor of a large cluster of neural genes containing RE1 motifs. In neurons, REST homeostatically regulates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, However, whether REST can be regulated by Ca2+ and Ca2+-activated kinases is unknown. Here, we investigated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) as upstream regulators of REST fate and activity. We show that REST is phosphorylated by CaMKIV at a main Ser-322 site located within the linker between the 5th and the 6th N-terminal Zn-finger domains. Phosphomimic REST mutant in Serine-322 decreased REST repressor activity and caused its transition from nucleus to cytosol, followed by degradation. Molecular dynamics simulations of the phosphomimic N-terminal REST and the DNA RE1 sequence revealed a sharp decrease in the stability of the REST-RE1 binding interface. Moreover, the homeostatic effects of CaMKIV on the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents were inhibited by the genetic deletion of REST. The results demonstrate that REST phosphorylation by CaMKIV regulates the repressor activity of REST on neural genes and has a crucial role in the homeostatic regulation of REST levels.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "content": "PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) on cognitive flexibility under different levels of task complexity. The hypothesis was that taVNS would enhance cognitive flexibility more effectively under demanding task conditions.MethodA within-subject design was used, involving 24 healthy adults who completed a Dimensional Change Card Sorting task combined with an auditory task of varying difficulty levels (low, medium, high). Participants underwent both active and sham taVNS conditions while performing the tasks. The complexity of the auditory task served to reduce cognitive resources available for the cognitive flexibility task, allowing an assessment of how taVNS modulates cognitive flexibility under different task difficulty conditions.ResultsThe results show that switch costs in the Dimensional Change Card Sorting task increase with task difficulty. In addition, active taVNS reduced switch costs significantly in the high complexity condition, while no differences were observed in the low and medium complexity conditions. This indicates that taVNS is particularly effective in conditions of higher cognitive demand.ConclusionThe findings suggest that taVNS enhances cognitive flexibility, especially in more complex tasks, providing a better understanding of the effects of taVNS on cognitive control.",

      "title": "The slowest timescales of neural synchronization reveal the strongest influence of auditory distraction",
      "content": "IntroductionAmong all the sounds occurring at any given time, people are often interested in listening to just one. Some competing sounds are merely background noise, whereas others distract attention from target sounds and are less easily suppressed. During active listening, the central auditory pathway unmixes target and distractor sounds based on temporal differences across three orders of magnitude \u2013 from millisecond differences in acoustic temporal fine structure to slower perceptual grouping factors that stretch out to multiple seconds. We developed an approach to directly measure central auditory encoding of multiplexed target and distractor sound features in human listeners to determine which timescales are most impacted by the presence of distracting sounds.MethodsTarget sounds contained nested features along four timescales, including temporal fine structure (~500 Hz), temporal envelope (~25\u201380 Hz), envelope changes (~7 Hz), and slower changes reflecting whether target stimuli were randomly arranged or formed a repeating pattern (~0.5 Hz). Targets were presented with competing sounds that provided variable distraction levels: either a highly distracting melody or a less distracting noise. Neural synchronization to each timescale was simultaneously measured for target and distractor sounds from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during a listening task.ResultsSustained shifts from random to regular sequence arrangements were reliably perceived, yet did not evoke a pattern recognition potential, nor neural synchronization changes at any timescale. Synchronization to relatively slow changes in envelope transitions of the target sound deteriorated with the addition of more distracting sounds while synchronization to more rapid fluctuations in the fine structure or envelope were unaffected by varying distraction level. Categorizing trials by task performance revealed a conjunction of enhanced entrainment to slower temporal features in the distractor sound and reduced synchronization to the target sound on error trials.DiscussionBy designing a stimulus paradigm that leveraged the temporal processing capabilities of the auditory nervous system, we were able to simultaneously quantify multiple target and distractor sound features reproduced in the EEG. This paradigm identified synchronization processes which may prove valuable for research on clinical populations who report difficulty suppressing awareness of distracting sounds.",

      "title": "Cognitive and neuroanatomical assessment of alexia and agraphia in Japanese: implications for the European languages",
      "content": "The Japanese language has a unique writing system that consists of kanji (morphograms, derived from Chinese characters) and kana (phonograms, a simplified form of kanji representing syllables). A kanji character has two distinct ways of reading: on-reading (Chinese-style pronunciation) and kun-reading (native Japanese pronunciation). Some kanji words have irregular kun-reading called jukujikun. Furthermore, kana characters have two script forms: hiragana (cursive form) and katakana (square form), each of which is used for different purposes. Because of these features, Japanese individuals with alexia and agraphia show characteristic symptoms. Lesion-to-symptom analyses and functional imaging studies developed beginning in the 1970s have reported the following findings: (1) kanji\u2013kana dissociation in alexia/agraphia: pure alexia for kanji or kana, lexical agraphia for kanji, and phonological agraphia for kana; (2) on-kun dissociation in alexia: predominant kun-reading and jukujikun reading impairment in semantic dementia and selective on-reading impairment in the extensive posterior middle temporal gyrus lesion; and (3) allographic agraphia between hiragana and katakana.",

      "title": "Predicting attachment style from EEG data on the Flanker task",
      "content": "Bowlby's attachment theory describes the differences that people exhibit in the way they form emotional bonds with others. The dimensional measure of attachment describes it by the magnitude of anxiety and an avoidance dimension, which are currently measured using a self-report questionnaire. Recent advances in neurophysiological methods have started exploring the neural underpinnings of attachment styles. Nonetheless, a conspicuous gap remains: the underexplored realm of predictive models for predicting attachment styles based on objective physiological data. With that in mind, we have constructed a model for inferring individual attachment profiles, based solely on their brain signals recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG). For that aim, we recorded EEG data of 27 participants engaged in the Flanker task and receiving either positive or negative feedback following each trial. We then utilized the recently developed ROCKET algorithm (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) to automatically extract 20,000 time-series features from the EEG data. Next, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reduced the number of features to 87 individual components that were used to construct regression models predicting participants' anxiety and avoidance scores, as measured by the ECR-R questionnaire. Our results show, for the first time, that individual attachment profiles can be inferred from EEG data, allowing post hoc categorization into the four canonical attachment styles. This offers two key contributions: first, it provides an objective alternative to traditional self-report questionnaires, helping reduce subjectivity bias in attachment assessment. Second, it highlights the value of using automatically generated features over the limited set of hand-crafted features typically found in the literature.",

      "title": "Social and non-social directional cues differentially orient attention by learned habit",
      "content": "IntroductionSince an early age, we are implicitly motivated to use the direction of eye gaze of others to learn about the environment, and we orient our attention in space based on this directional signal. Similarly, we orient our attention based on the direction of arrow signs. In both cases, the mechanisms underlying attentional orienting rely on the activity of brain areas involved in endogenous attention; however, orienting by gaze direction also relies on brain areas involved in exogenous attention.Research questionsTo date, it remains unclear whether the acquisition of attentional habit, which can also guide attention in ways that are not purely endogenous or exogenous, is similar for gaze and arrow or rather differs in some important way. We aimed to assess whether learning implicit regularities implemented with exogenous, arrow, and gaze stimuli guides attention in space.MethodsUsing the Posner paradigm, we conducted a series of behavioral experiments with exogenous, arrow, and gaze cues. Unbeknownst to participants, specific regularities, namely cue predictive validity and probability cueing, were implemented through blocks (baseline, learning, testing).Results and discussionThe findings showed that predictive validity alone is not sufficient to engender habitual attention for all types of cues. However, it becomes effective when combined with probability cueing. Importantly, a learned habit with gaze cues engenders unique effects on attention compared to other cues.ConclusionSocially relevant directional signals, such as gaze, can bias spatial attention more effectively than perceptual or non-social directional stimuli.",

      "content": "IntroductionDyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by unilateral hemiparesis, facial asymmetry, severe epilepsy, and intellectual disability. While congenital DDMS is predominantly attributed to anterior circulation anomalies [e.g., internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) hypoplasia], posterior circulation involvement remains unreported. Here, we present the first documented case of congenital DDMS resulting from a rare combination of hypoplastic left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and ipsilateral fetal-type posterior communicating artery (FTP).Case presentationA 19-year-old male exhibited atypical DDMS manifestations: absence seizures, preserved motor function, and occipitotemporal cognitive deficits (MoCA: 20/30). Neuroimaging revealed classic DDMS features. Angiography confirmed left PCA hypoplasia with FTP persistence, while CT perfusion demonstrated chronic left PCA hypoperfusion. Lamotrigine (100\u202fmg/day) and regular cognition rehabilitative training resulted in good symptom control.ConclusionThis case identifies PCA hypoplasia with FTP as a novel DDMS etiology, challenging the MCA/ICA-centric paradigm. The \u201cposterior phenotype\u201d (absence seizures, preserved motor function, occipitotemporal cognitive deficits) expands DDMS heterogeneity. Multimodal imaging (angiography/perfusion) is diagnostic gold-standard, while personalized therapy optimizes outcomes.",

      "content": "BackgroundAcupuncture has been practiced in China for centuries, and LR3 (Taichong) is a key acupoint of the liver meridian that has been widely studied. Whether its central mechanism differs by sex remains unclear, because earlier work used single-sex or mixed-sex samples without stratified analysis. To close this gap, we used task-based fMRI together with the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale to compare sex differences in brain activation and thalamic functional connectivity.MethodsWe enrolled 30 men and 25 women in a block-design acupuncture task, the modular task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was employed to investigate brain activity, and the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess acupuncture sensations experienced by the participants. Alterations in activated brain regions and functional connectivity were examined separately for males and females. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential gender differences in acupuncture sensation.ResultsSignificant statistical differences were observed in the 12 acupuncture sensation scores of the MASS scale (p < 0.001). Acupuncture LR3 activated the left inferior cerebellar gyrus, right superior margin gyrus, and left posterior central gyrus in women, and activated the right superior margin gyrus, left central sulcus, and right paracentral lobule in men. Enhanced functional connectivity was also observed in the bilateral thalamus of women: the bilateral caudate nucleus, right precuneus, right cuneate fissure, and bilateral lingular gyrus were highly active. Furthermore, the right thalami also demonstrated enhanced functional connectivity with the left cuneate fissure, right posterior cingulate gyrua, and left precuneu.ConclusionThe differences in the functional connectivity of the right superior marginal gyrus and thalamus between men and women may account for the differences in acupuncture sensory processing between men and women. In addition, the right superior marginal gyrus may be a specific brain region critical for activation of the LR3 acupoint.",

      "content": "Zeroing neural network (ZNN) is viewed as an effective solution to time-varying nonlinear equation (TVNE). In this paper, a further study is shown by proposing a novel combined discrete-time ZNN (CDTZNN) model for solving TVNE. Specifically, a new difference formula, which is called the Taylor difference formula, is constructed for first-order derivative approximation by following Taylor series expansion. The Taylor difference formula is then used to discretize the continuous-time ZNN model in the previous study. The corresponding DTZNN model is obtained, where the direct Jacobian matrix inversion is required (being time consuming). Another DTZNN model for computing the inverse of Jacobian matrix is established to solve the aforementioned limitation. The novel CDTZNN model for solving the TVNE is thus developed by combining the two models. Theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed CDTZNN model. The CDTZNN applicability is further indicated by applying the proposed model to the motion planning of robot manipulators.",

However, highly parameterized deep neural networks usually require extensive user-specific data with ground truth labels to learn individual unique EMG patterns. However, the characteristics of the EMG signal can change significantly over time, even for the same user, leading to performance degradation during extended use. In this work, we propose an innovative three-stage neural network training scheme designed to progressively develop an adaptive workflow, improving and maintaining the network performance on 28 subjects over 2 days. Experiments demonstrate the importance and necessity of each stage in the proposed framework.",

      "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",

      "title": "Integrated neural network framework for multi-object detection and recognition using UAV imagery",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

      "content": "Fine-grained image classification tasks face challenges such as difficulty in labeling, scarcity of samples, and small category differences. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel fine-grained image classification method based on the MogaNet network and a multi-level gating mechanism. A feature extraction network based on MogaNet is constructed, and multi-scale feature fusion is combined to fully mine image information. The contextual information extractor is designed to align and filter more discriminative local features using the semantic context of the network, thereby strengthening the network\u2019s ability to capture detailed features. Meanwhile, a multi-level gating mechanism is introduced to obtain the saliency features of images. A feature elimination strategy is proposed to suppress the interference of fuzzy class features and background noise. A loss function is designed to constrain the elimination of fuzzy class features and classification prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the new method can be applied to 5-shot tasks across four public datasets: Mini-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. The accuracy rates reach 79.33, 87.58, 79.34, and 83.82%, respectively, which shows better performance than other state-of-the-art image classification methods.",

      "content": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) integration with virtual reality (VR) has progressed from single-limb control to multi-limb coordination, yet achieving intuitive tri-manual operation remains challenging. This study presents a consumer-grade hybrid BCI-VR framework enabling simultaneous control of two biological hands and a virtual third limb through integration of Tobii eye-tracking, NeuroSky single-channel EEG, and non-haptic controllers. The system employs e-Sense attention thresholds (>80% for 300\u202fms) to trigger virtual hand activation combined with gaze-driven targeting within 45\u00b0 visual cones. A soft maximum weighted arbitration algorithm resolves spatiotemporal conflicts between manual and virtual inputs with 92.4% success rate. Experimental validation with eight participants across 160 trials demonstrated 87.5% virtual hand success rate and 41% spatial error reduction (\u03c3\u202f=\u202f0.23\u202fmm vs. 0.39\u202fmm) compared to traditional dual-hand control. The framework achieved 320\u202fms activation latency and 22% NASA-TLX workload reduction through adaptive cognitive load management. Time-frequency analysis revealed characteristic beta-band (15-20\u202fHz) energy modulations during successful virtual limb control, providing neurophysiological evidence for attention-mediated supernumerary limb embodiment. These findings demonstrate that sophisticated algorithmic approaches can compensate for consumer-grade hardware limitations, enabling laboratory-grade precision in accessible tri-manual VR applications for rehabilitation, training, and assistive technologies.",

      "title": "Variable admittance control with sEMG-based support for wearable wrist exoskeleton",
      "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

      "content": "Orexin (Orx) and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area are central to regulating the sleep-wake cycle and coordinating memory consolidation and forgetting through dynamic homeostatic mechanisms. This review systematically examines the functional characteristics of these two neural systems and their interactions: first, MCH neurons facilitate the transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at night via a dual regulatory mechanism and regulate the active forgetting of memories via hippocampal neural circuits; second, orexin neurons maintain homeostasis in daytime wakefulness via monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways, while acting as stabilizers during REM sleep stages and enhance memory encoding through amygdala-prefrontal projections. Notably, these two systems show unique antagonistic synergetic dual-mode regulation under the framework of circadian rhythm: orexin neurons maintain the steady state of sleep-wake cycle by promoting wakefulness and inhibiting REM sleep and MCH neurons form dynamic antagonism by inducing sleep and enhancing REM sleep in the sleep-wake dimension, whereas a coordinated balance of information filtering is achieved in the memory regulation dimension through phasic encoding of hippocampal theta rhythms. Clinically, orexin receptor agonists demonstrate therapeutic potential in narcolepsy management, whereas MCH receptor antagonists show promise for memory reconsolidation in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This review emphasizes the dynamic interplay and reciprocal inhibition between orexin and MCH neurons that form a pivotal bidirectional network framework for dissecting neuropsychiatric comorbidities, wherein pathway dysregulation may propagate from circadian disruption to mnemonic dysfunction, which provides a new theoretical framework for developing intervention strategies across symptom dimensions.",
