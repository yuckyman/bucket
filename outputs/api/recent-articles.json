Well, in fact they are still there, but the peak was at around 9 am European Time.</p> <p>Because I just &quot;rejoined&quot; the academic workforce after working in industry for 6 years, I was thinking it is a good time to post something I am currently working on: a space mission instrument that will go to the active asteroid (3200) Phaethon! Ok, I am not posting (for now) my actual work, but I wanted to share with you the astro-dynamical ideas that are behind the scientific conclusion that the Geminids are related to this asteroid.</p> <p>The parameter that allows us to compute dynamical relation is the so called &quot;D_SH&quot; parameter from 1963! And in a short tutorial I explain this parameter and its usage in a Python script. Maybe someone of you wants to learn something about our cosmic vicinity using Python :)?</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/txjo_bNAOrc?si=HLeZ3c3D2-QI7ESf\">https://youtu.be/txjo_bNAOrc?si=HLeZ3c3D2-QI7ESf</a></p> <p>And the correspoding code: <a href=\"https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/CompressedCosmos/CompressedCosmos_Geminids_and_Phaethon.ipynb\">https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/CompressedCosmos/CompressedCosmos_Geminids_and_Phaethon.ipynb</a></p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Thomas</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas\"> /u/MrAstroThomas </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmdshy/the_geminids_meteors_the_active_asteroids/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmdshy/the_geminids_meteors_the_active_asteroids/\">[comments]</a></span>",
