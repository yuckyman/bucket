      "title": "MRI-Based Quantification of Central Nervous System Tissue and Cerebrospinal Fluid Volumes in Developing Pigs",
      "content": "There is a growing need for alternative animal models to test brain-targeted therapies, and pigs are emerging as a promising option. Their utility, however, depends on reliable estimations of central nervous system (CNS) tissue and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes, which are essential for translating therapeutic doses between studies in animals and humans. To address this need, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 12 commercial pigs (Sus scrofa) across four age groups (2, 5, 11, and 19 weeks). High-resolution magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain and spinal cord were acquired using T2-weighted turbo spin echo with fat saturation and short tau inversion recovery scans. CNS tissue and CSF volumes were segmented and quantified using 3D Slicer, along with additional anatomical measurements. Our findings reveal notable age-related changes, including spinal CSF volume surpassing brain CSF volume in older pigs, highlighting shifts in CSF distribution that may influence dosing and delivery strategies for CNS-targeted therapies. This study provides a reference for future research using pig models in CNS disease studies and underscores the importance of incorporating brain and spinal CSF and CNS volume data into preclinical models.",

      "title": "Hebbian learning accounts for the effects of experience and novel exposure on representational drift in CA1 of hippocampus",
      "content": "Neuronal activity patterns slowly change over time even when sensory stimuli and animal behavior remain stable, a phenomenon known as representational drift. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, the amount of drift in the tuning of place cells on a familiar linear track is proportional to the time the animal spends exploring that track while the drift in cells' mean rate depends on the absolute time elapsed between sessions. Recently it was shown that exploration of a novel, enriched environment between sessions on the familiar track actually decreases the drift in tuning on that track, i.e. it stabilizes place fields compared to a baseline condition without the novel learning. This finding challenges computational models of drift in which new learning leads to overwriting and hence one would expect more drift, not less. Here we show that such models are indeed compatible with the observed findings as long as spatially-tuned input populations to CA1 which are active on the track versus the enriched environment are largely non-overlapping. Furthermore, in order to reproduce the findings, we must assume that the total amount of learning between the baseline and novel-exposure conditions is the same. Namely, the synaptic resources available for encoding patterns, or episodes, is fixed over a given period of time, but can be preferentially allocated to episodes of particular salience, such as the exploration of novel environments.",

      "title": "Sleep deprivation constrains dynamic configurations of integrated and segregated brain states impacting cognitive performance",
      "content": "The breakdown of cognitive control following sleep deprivation is widely recognised, but the physiological mechanisms and brain signatures that produce this vulnerability have not been resolved. Effective cognition relies on large-scale brain networks flexibly reconfiguring between states of integration and segregation. Here we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocardiography (ECG) collected during cognitive tasks under rested wakefulness, after sleep deprivation, and following a recovery nap to test the hypothesis that sleep deprivation constrains this dynamical repertoire and disrupts its physiological regulation. Using time-resolved functional connectivity and graph theory, we show that sleep deprivation increases the distribution of connections across networks, while reducing the temporal variability of between-network connectivity. Furthermore, dynamic fluctuations between integrated and segregated modes of network topology were dampened, with brain regions spending more time in intermediate configurations and showing greater instability of mode transitions. These alterations were tightly linked to behavioural impairment: participants who exhibited greater contraction toward intermediate topologies also showed poorer task accuracy and slower responses. Under well-rested conditions, thalamic activity peaked prior to transitions into integrated states and was suppressed during transitions into segregated states, consistent with a coordinating role in cortical dynamics. Sleep deprivation weakened and delayed this thalamic coupling. Finally, global and regional fMRI fluctuations were elevated after sleep loss, becoming decoupled from cardiac physiology while more strongly coupled to EEG delta power, further linking reduced arousal to constrained network flexibility. Together, these findings show that sleep deprivation narrows the brain's dynamical repertoire, due to disrupted thalamic regulation and changes to the physiological integration with cortical networks.",

      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
