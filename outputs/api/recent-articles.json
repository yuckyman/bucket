      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "MMoGCN: a multi-gate mixture of graph convolutional network model for EEG emotion and mood disorder recognition",
      "content": "Objective. Emotional states and mood disorders are closely interconnected, and their joint recognition serves as a critical pathway to uncovering their intrinsic relationship. Currently, deep learning (DL) models based on electroencephalogram (EEG) have achieved significant progress in single tasks such as emotion recognition or mood disorder (MD) recognition. However, most existing models are limited to handling only one of these tasks independently and fail to effectively leverage the shared features in EEG data related to both emotions and mood disorders. This limitation hinders the in-depth exploration of the complex interplay between emotions and mood disorders. Therefore, this study aims to develop an EEG-based DL framework for the joint recognition of emotions and mood disorders, thereby providing a foundation for further investigation into their interaction. Approach. We design a multi-gate mixture-of-experts graph convolutional network model(MMoGCN) for joint emotion and MD recognition. MMoGCN comprises three key modules: (1) a feature extraction module based on differential entropy to robustly represent EEG signals; (2) a Multi-gated shared experts module, which integrates two experts, and combines them through a gating mechanism to extract shared representations across tasks; and (3) adaptive task-specific towers, which consist of individual classification towers for each task and incorporate an adaptive weighting loss function to dynamically adjust task contributions. MMoGCN is evaluated on a self-collected dataset and further validated on the public DEAP dataset. Main results. MMoGCN achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines in both emotion and MD recognition. Validation experiments on DEAP further demonstrate the scalability and generalization of MMoGCN. Significance. An effective multi-task learning model is proposed for joint emotion and MD recognition based on EEG. Additionally, the cognitive differences are also analyzed in emotional responses between healthy controls and subjects with mood disorders, providing methodological insights and potential assistance for cognitive rehabilitation from both cognitive and emotional perspectives.",

      "content": "Objective. Deep learning (DL) exhibits considerable potential for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) classification in electroencephalography-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs). SSVEP signals contain both frequency and phase characteristics that correspond to the visual stimuli. However, existing DL training strategies typically focus on either frequency or phase information alone, thus failing to fully exploit these dual inherent properties and substantially limiting classification accuracy. Approach. To tackle this limitation, this study proposes a joint frequency-phase training strategy (JFPTS), which comprises two complementary stages with distinct time-window sampling schemes. The first stage adopts a frequency prior-driven sampling scheme to improve frequency component utilization, whereas the second stage employs a phase-locked sampling scheme to enhance intra-category phase consistency. This design enables JFPTS to effectively leverage both frequency and phase properties of SSVEP signals. Main results. Comprehensive experiments on two well-established public datasets validate the effectiveness of JFPTS. The results demonstrate that the JFPTS-enhanced model achieves a marked superiority over the current state-of-the-art classification approaches, notably surpassing the long-standing performance benchmark set by task-discriminative component analysis (TDCA). Significance. Overall, JFPTS establishes a new training paradigm that advances DL approaches for SSVEP classification and promotes the broader adoption of SSVEP-BCIs.",

      "content": "Objective. Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic (EMG) signals into control commands, enabling immersive human\u2013robot interactions in the real world and the Metaverse. The variability of EMG due to various confounding factors leads to significant performance degradation. Such variability can be mitigated by training a highly generalizable but massively parameterized deep neural network, which can be effectively scaled using a vast dataset. We aim to find an alternative simple, explainable, efficient and parallelizable model, which can flexibly scale up with a larger dataset and scale down to reduce model size, and thereby will significantly facilitate the practical implementation of myoelectric control. Approach. In this work, we discuss the scalability of a random forest (RF) for myoelectric control. We show how to scale an RF up and down during the process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and automatic self-calibration. The effects of diverse factors such as bootstrapping, decision tree editing (pre-training, pruning, grafting, appending), and the size of training data are systematically studied using EMG data from 106 participants including both low- and high-density electrodes. Main results. We examined several factors that affect the size and accuracy of the model. The best solution could reduce the size of RF models by 500\u00d7, with the accuracy reduced by only 1.5%. Importantly, for the first time we report the merit of RF that with more EMG electrodes (higher input dimension), the RF model size would be reduced. Significance. All of these findings contribute to the real time deployment RF models in real world myoelectric control applications.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019m the maintainer of reaktiv, a reactive state management library for Python inspired by the DX of Angular Signals and SolidJS. I\u2019ve just released v0.21.0, which introduces a major new primitive: Resource.</p> <p>If you've ever dealt with the &quot;tangled web&quot; of managing loading states, error handling, and race conditions in async Python, this release is for you.</p> <h1>Why the Angular connection?</h1> <p>The Angular community has been doing incredible work with fine-grained reactivity. Their introduction of the <code>resource()</code> API solved a huge pain point: how to declaratively link a reactive variable (a Signal) to an asynchronous fetch operation. I wanted that exact same &quot;it just works&quot; experience in the Python ecosystem.</p> <h1>How it works: Push + Pull</h1> <p>One of the core strengths of reaktiv (and why it scales so well) is the combination of Push and Pull reactivity:</p> <ul> <li>The Push: When a dependency (like a Signal) changes, it pushes a notification down the dependency graph to mark all related Computed or Resource values as &quot;dirty.&quot; It doesn't recalculate them immediately - it just lets them know they are out of date.</li> <li>The Pull: The actual computation only happens when you pull (read) the value. If no one is listening to or reading the value, no work is done.</li> </ul> <p>This hybrid approach ensures your app stays efficient - performing the minimum amount of work necessary to keep your state consistent.</p> <h1>What\u2019s new in v0.21.0?</h1> <ul> <li>Resource Primitive: Automatically syncs async loaders with reactive state.</li> <li>Built-in Loading States: Native <code>.is_loading()</code> and <code>.value()</code> signals.</li> <li>Dependency Tracking: If the request signal changes, the loader is re-triggered automatically.</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019d love to get your feedback on the API.</p> <ul> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv\">https://github.com/buiapp/reaktiv</a></li> <li>Docs: <a href=\"https://reaktiv.bui.app/\">https://reaktiv.bui.app/</a></li> <li><code>Resource</code> User Guide: <a href=\"https://reaktiv.bui.app/docs/resource-guide.html\">https://reaktiv.bui.app/docs/resource-guide.html</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/loyoan\"> /u/loyoan </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjpymj/i_brought_resource_primitives_to_python_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjpymj/i_brought_resource_primitives_to_python_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",
