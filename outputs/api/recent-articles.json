      "title": "Cerebral cortical structures linked to intelligence",
      "content": "Understanding the neural basis of intelligence in humans remains an ongoing scientific pursuit. Early studies with small samples identified potential regions but lacked consistency across findings. Recent large-scale magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets, using intelligence measures focused on verbal-numerical reasoning, now offer more robust opportunities for discovery. In this study (N=11,289), we showed the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as exhibiting the strongest effect size and a significant causal relationship with intelligence, where larger surface area predicts higher intelligence as revealed by Mendelian randomization analyses. Additional regions, including the orbitofrontal and temporal cortices, also showed causal links to intelligence. These regions are critical for working memory, executive function, and language. Reverse causality analyses further indicated that higher intelligence contributes to increased total surface area and greater cortical thickness in the perisylvian language region. Our findings replicate prior evidence of a bidirectional relationship between total surface area and intelligence and further offer novel insights into regional cortical associations and causal effect. Collectively, these findings support a polyregional cortical configuration of intelligence, highlighting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a key hub for cognitive ability.",

      "title": "Non-overlapping social and food reward representations in the basolateral amygdala",
      "content": "The ability to consider and appraise positively valenced stimuli in the environment, such as food and social interaction, to guide appropriate action is important for survival of most animals. Several studies have compared how food and social rewards are represented in different regions involved in reward processing and found either overlapping or distinct representations. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA) there seems to be opposing evidence for both shared and unique encoding of social and nonsocial stimuli. In our recent work, we found that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region reciprocally connected to the BLA, has distinct social and food representations using a novel self-paced two-choice assay. Given that the BLA and mPFC play differing roles in reward processing, it is important to understand how these two nodes may differ in their encoding reward types within the same assay. To resolve how the BLA encodes social and food information, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in female and male mice during a two-choice social-sucrose operant task. We found that BLA neurons robustly and distinctly respond to social and food reward. In contrast to the mPFC, BLA neurons did not show a bias towards social reward responsiveness and instead showed equal social/sucrose representation, in males, or a sucrose reward bias, in females. BLA neurons were sensitive to internal state - water deprivation increased the proportion of sucrose reward responsive neurons. Additionally, sucrose reward responsive BLA neurons were differentially sensitive to reward omissions, such that neurons that were excited by sucrose reward were more sensitive to reward omissions compared to those inhibited by reward. Together, these findings demonstrate distinct, heterogeneous response profiles within the BLA to social and food rewards, in a manner different from the mPFC.",

      "title": "Typical development of the human fetal subplate: regional heterogeneity, growth, and asymmetry assessed by in vivo T2-weighted MRI",
      "content": "The subplate (SP) is a transient fetal brain compartment supporting neuronal migration, axonal ingrowth, and early cortical activity, yet the dynamics of its regional development remain poorly understood in vivo. Using T2-weighted fetal MRI of 68 typically developing fetuses (22-32 weeks gestational age, GA), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to quantify regional SP morphology (thickness, surface area, and volume). SP characteristics scaled strongly with GA and residual brain volume and showed marked regional differences. After correcting for geometric confounds, regional variation of SP thickness persisted, with highest values in parietal and perisylvian regions, suggesting that SP thickness may serve as a sensitive marker of intrinsic developmental differences. Between late 2nd and early 3rd trimester, mean SP thickness increased by 39.2% with large variation across regions (11.0 SD), whereas surface area growth was more uniform (64.3%, 0.7 SD). Continuous growth trajectories clustered into distinct spatiotemporal profiles: early-developing regions (e.g., pericentral and medial occipital cortices) contrasted with later-developing regions (prefrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices). These patterns partially recapitulate primary-to-association, medial-to-lateral, and posterior-to-anterior maturational hierarchies, pointing to organized developmental program. SP development also showed region-specific hemispheric asymmetries, including leftward thickness and volume asymmetry in superior temporal and precentral gyri. Some asymmetries amplified, others attenuated or reversed with age, suggesting both transient states and potential precursors of postnatal lateralization. Together, these findings provide a framework for regional SP quantification and position SP morphology, particularly thickness, as a promising early biomarker that might link fetal SP changes to subsequent cortical development and neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

      "title": "Sexual Dimorphism in c-Fos Networks Governing Aggression",
      "content": "Circuit based studies of aggression often focus on the output of a small group of regions referred to as the core aggression circuit, yet a whole brain map of activity has yet to be produced. Using resident intruder assays in male and female Swiss Webster mice, we combined iDISCO+ cFos imaging with a weighted co-expression network analyses to identify mesoscale co-activation modules in aggressive (AGG) vs. non-aggressive (NON) animals. We performed a module preservation analysis between each phenotype within each sex followed by differential correlation to localize edge-level changes. Behaviorally, AGG mice spent more time attacking, while females showed greater social investigation. Network analyses revealed that NON networks often preserved density of AGG modules, but connectivity reorganized with aggression. In male AGGs there was large spread reorganization of numerous modules: a large sensorimotor subcortical blue module, a pallidal/hypothalamic/brainstem yellow module, and a brainstem-heavy green module. Surprisingly the brown module, enriched for classic social-behavior regions was moderately preserved in male NONs. In females, the turquoise module spanning somatosensory/interoceptive cortex and midbrain regions and the brown sensory cortex/amygdala module were the least preserved. These results indicate that aggression recruits distributed mesoscale communities via edge-specific gain, with males displaying broad strengthening along a cortex/basal ganglia/ hypothalamus/brainstem axis and females showing more targeted potentiation within sensory/arousal modules. This framework nominates candidate hubs and edges for causal manipulation.",

      "title": "Astrocytes and neurons encode natural stimuli with partially shared but distinct composite receptive fields",
      "content": "Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as active participants in sensory processing, but whether they show selective responses to stimulus features, analogous to neuronal receptive fields, is not yet established. To address this, we used two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of anesthetized mice during presentation of natural ultrasonic vocalizations. Our aim was to compare astrocytic responses with those of neighboring neurons and to determine whether astrocytes exhibit feature-selective receptive fields. Event detection showed that astrocytic calcium activity is highly heterogeneous, but only a minority of events were consistently stimulus-linked. To examine this stimulus-driven subset, we estimated receptive field features using maximum noise entropy modeling and compared them with those of concurrently recorded neurons. Despite qualitative similarities in receptive-field features, analysis of modulation spectra and principal angles showed that astrocytic and neuronal receptive fields overlap but occupy distinct regions of feature space. This indicates that astrocytes and neurons encode partially shared, but not identical, dimensions of the sensory stimulus. Our findings indicate that astrocytes encode diverse sensory features, providing an additional contribution to neuronal encoding. This suggests that astrocytic calcium activity is not simply a reflection of neuronal firing, but instead represents a distinct component of cortical sensory processing.",

      "title": "Investigating the effect of channel pruning on functional near-infrared spectroscopy data collected from children aged 5-24 months",
      "content": "Significance Infant functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data are particularly vulnerable to noise; participant behaviour can result in motion artefacts and reduced set-up times can cause poor optode coupling. Accurate channel pruning is therefore essential but approaches vary and often use adult-derived thresholds, risking unnecessary data loss. Aim This work systematically compared pruning approaches and parameter choices to evaluate their effects on data quality and retention in infant fNIRS. Approach Data from 5-24 month-old infants were collected across two cohorts, using two paradigms. Channel pruning was performed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Quality Testing of Near Infrared Scans (QT-NIRS) tool, varying key thresholds. Multilevel models assessed effects of pruning method, parameter choice, age, motion, and testing site on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channels retained. Results QT-NIRS produced significantly higher SNR than CV pruning across nearly all age, task, and cohort combinations, when matched for data retention. Higher QT-NIRS thresholds improved quality but reduced retention. Motion prevalence strongly reduced both SNR and retention; testing site and age had smaller but notable effects. Conclusions QT-NIRS offers a better balance of data quality and retention than CV pruning. Lower QT-NIRS thresholds than adult defaults are recommended for infant data. These findings provide practical guidance for preprocessing pipelines in developmental fNIRS research.",

      "title": "Evidence for age-related vulnerability in dopamine-glutamate projections to the lateral entorhinal cortex",
      "content": "The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is selectively vulnerable to age-related decline and is essential for novelty detection and episodic memory. While dopaminergic (DAergic) input is known to modulate LEC function, how aging impacts this circuitry remains unclear. Here, we used two viral labeling strategies to investigate projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the LEC. First, we employed an INTRSECT dual-recombinase approach in TH-Flp::VGLUT2-Cre mice to selectively label dopamine-only (DA-only) and dopamine-glutamate co-releasing (DA-GLU) neurons. Next, we used a DAT-Cre-driven ChR2-YFP strategy to broadly label all DA axons. We found that both DA-only and DA-GLU populations innervate the LEC. With age, we observed a selective reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) signal within DA axons in the LEC, despite preserved axonal structure as revealed by YFP labeling. VGLUT2 signal within DA-GLU terminals appeared less affected. In the VTA, TH+ neuron density declined with age, with distinct spatial patterns along the anterior-posterior axis. These findings reveal an age-related vulnerability of DAergic projections to the LEC and suggest a circuit-level mechanism may contribute to memory impairments in aging.",

      "content": "The maturation of the auditory system is critical for the development of speech perception from childhood through early adulthood. However, the developmental trajectories and behavioral significance of cortical responses to speech sounds, particularly in relation to frequency specificity, remain poorly understood. Here, we presented low-frequency (/m/) and high-frequency (/s/) speech sounds to 60 typically developing individuals aged 5-24 years and recorded early cortical responses (P1 and N1) using electroencephalography. We also examined associations between these neural responses and speech understanding in quiet and in the presence of speech interferers. The developmental trajectories of P1 and N1 revealed distinct age- and stimulus-dependent patterns, including both linear and non-linear changes across development. These findings delineate frequency-specific maturational profiles within the cortical auditory system and identify potential neurophysiological markers of speech perception, providing a normative benchmark for assessing atypical auditory development.",

      "content": "The striatum, the primary input nucleus of the basal ganglia, contains diverse populations of projection neurons and interneurons, each with distinct roles in motor processing. The external globus pallidus contains distinct populations of inhibitory neurons that are highly interconnected with other regions of the basal ganglia. How pallidal neurons innervate different populations of striatal neurons is critical for our understanding of their role in motor processing. Here we use monosynaptic viral tracing in transgenic mice to quantitively define the organization of pallidostriatal connectivity. We show that FoxP2-expressing arkypallidal neurons provide the greatest input to the striatum, primarily targeting indirect pathway spiny projection neurons and cholinergic interneurons. In contrast, prototypic pallidal neurons, defined by Nkx2-1 expression, preferentially innervate parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons. These data reveal a structured and selective organization of pallidostriatal projections, suggesting that distinct classes of pallidal neurons modulate striatal circuits through complementary pathways. Mapping these connections is key to understanding how basal ganglia networks coordinate motor control.",

      "title": "Measured and modelled transitions between self-paced walking and synchronization with rhythmic auditory cues",
      "content": "Constraining gait rhythm with a metronome has been shown to influence gait pattern in many different ways. While rhythmic cues can improve several parameters in some clinical populations, they do alter the long-range autocorrelations naturally exhibited in series of stride durations. However, transitions between walking with and without a metronome (and vice versa) have not been measured; it is therefore unclear how people adapt to such a change in task. To address this gap, a total of 21 healthy volunteers were asked to walk overground under three conditions: one unconstrained control condition, followed by two conditions in which a metronome was activated during either the first or second half of the trial to test both transitions. The long-range autocorrelations were assessed over a sliding window on the stride series to measure their evolution. Our observations were reproduced with a computational model allowing us to relate sudden changes in movement parameters to the long-range autocorrelations, which are typically measured over longer timescales. The results showed a clear transition in both conditions involving a metronome, with long-range autocorrelations of the series of stride durations gradually reduced when the metronome was turned on and recovered when it was turned off. In these two conditions, the change in long-range autocorrelations could be reproduced in the model by an instantaneous switching of the control policy associated with the presence or not of the metronome, suggesting that long-range autocorrelations emerge from a flexible control strategy that rapidly regulates timing and amplitude parameters according to task requirements.",

Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",
