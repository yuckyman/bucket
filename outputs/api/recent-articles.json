      "title": "Stress resilience is associated with transcriptional remodeling in the VTA",
      "content": "Individual responses to chronic stress vary, with some individuals remaining resilient while others exhibit susceptibility. The ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region involved in reward learning, and the lateral habenula (LHb), a region involved in aversive learning, have been implicated in the pathophysiology of stress-related mood disorders. Here, we seek to understand the molecular adaptations in these regions at the level of single cells that mediate susceptibility versus resilience. In particular, it remains unclear whether, at the level of gene expression, different cell types within different brain regions mediate stress susceptibility versus resilience, or if these phenotypes are mediated by distinct trajectories within the same cell types. To address this gap, we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of LHb and VTA of mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress. While we found minimal gene expression changes in the LHb after stress, the VTA exhibited widespread, cell type-specific transcriptional remodeling in resilient individuals and few gene expression changes in susceptible individuals. Across VTA cell types, resilience was associated with the coordinated upregulation of genes involved in intercellular signaling and neural communication, with maintenance of receptor-ligand interaction strength in resilience that was not present in susceptibility. Within VTA neurons, gene expression changes were most prominent in glutamatergic and dopaminergic clusters. Multivariate analyses of dopamine and glutamate subclusters showed that resilient neurons diverged more from control than susceptible neurons, but along a similar trajectory, supporting a model in which resilience reflects greater stress-related adaptations in these cell types. Together, these findings highlight the VTA as a key site of molecular plasticity in stress resilience and therefore a potential therapeutic target.",

      "title": "Characterizing neuronal population geometry with AI equation discovery",
      "content": "The visual cortex contains millions of neurons, whose combined activity forms a population code representing visual stimuli. There is, however, a discrepancy between our understanding of this code at the single neuron and population levels: direct measurements suggest that the population code is high-dimensional, but current understanding of single-cell tuning curves implies low dimensionality. To reconcile this discrepancy, we used AI to find a new parsimonious, interpretable equation for tuning curves to oriented stimuli. Candidate equations were expressed as short computer programs, and evolved using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their fits to single-cell tuning. This resulted in an equation that not only improved single-cell fits, but also accurately modelled the population code's high-dimensional structure, even though population dimensionality was not the AI system's objective. This high-dimensionality occurred because the AI-derived tuning curves were not smooth at their peaks, which we proved is mathematically required for high-dimensional population coding of low-dimensional stimuli. We used the AI-generated tuning equation to demonstrate the advantages of high-dimensional codes in a simulated hyperacuity task, and showed that non-smooth peaks are also present in other brain systems, leading to high-dimensional population coding in head direction cells. These results suggest that the smoothness of neuronal tuning curves has an important role in setting the dimensionality of the population code, and demonstrate how AI equation discovery can accelerate scientific theory building in neuroscience and beyond.",

      "title": "Inhibitory inputs to avian ITD circuits",
      "content": "In birds, detection of sound source azimuth begins in the nucleus laminaris (NL), which computes interaural time differences (ITDs). Inhibition has been proposed to protect NL neurons from losing ITD sensitivity with increasing sound level, although the nature of this inhibition is incompletely understood. Anatomical studies show GABAergic synapses throughout NL and the first order nuclei, while in vitro studies in chicken NL showed that depolarizing, GABAergic IPSPs shorten membrane time constants, perhaps to allow the membrane potential to follow rapid synaptic currents accurately over a range of sound levels. Given the importance of inhibition in regulating auditory brainstem activity, we examined the nature of the inhibitory input to NL in vivo. The Superior Olivary Nucleus (SON) is the major source of descending GABAergic inhibition to the ipsilateral nucleus magnocellularis (NM), nucleus angularis (NA) and NL, and receives excitatory input from NA and NL. We used viral tracers to reveal projections from SON to NL, and characterized response types within SON. In NL, we isolated inhibitory synaptic currents from extracellular field potentials through the iontophoretic application of blockers of GABA (gabazine) or glycine (strychnine). These blockers increase the onset and offset responses evoked by tonal stimuli, but did not shift best ITD. The co-application of gabazine and strychnine revealed supra-linear summation of GABA and glycine. Profiles of synaptic activation revealed more prominent inhibition following stimulus offset, suggesting inputs to NL originate from both the sustained and offset response types of the SON. These heterogeneous responses may represent separate SON neuronal populations.",

      "content": "Neuronal assemblies--groups of co-active neurons--support memory consolidation and retrieval. In the hippocampus, assemblies can pre-exist learning and contribute to memory through sequential activation. Whether similar principles apply to higher cortical areas for flexible memory storage like the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) remains unclear. Using a novel ground truth-validated clustering approach, we investigated the activity of longitudinally tracked mouse OFC neurons during cue-reward memory acquisition and maintenance. Assemblies active after learning pre-existed the learning and exhibited two distinct sequential dynamics suggestive of memory consolidation or retrieval. Consolidation sequences emerged during learning, while retrieval sequences partly recruited pre-existing reward sequences. These findings demonstrate that OFC learning recruits pre-existing networks flexibly repurposed for new associations, revealing circuit motifs that may enable cortical memory storage.",

      "title": "Efficient and reproducible pipelines for spike sorting large-scale electrophysiology data",
      "content": "The scale of in vivo electrophysiology has expanded in recent years, with simultaneous recordings across thousands of electrodes now becoming routine. These advances have enabled a wide range of discoveries, but they also impose substantial computational demands. Spike sorting, the procedure that extracts spikes from extracellular voltage measurements, remains a major bottleneck: a dataset collected in a few hours can take days to spike sort on a single machine, and the field lacks rigorous validation of the many spike sorting algorithms and preprocessing steps that are in use. Advancing the speed and accuracy of spike sorting is essential to fully realize the potential of large-scale electrophysiology. Here, we present an end-to-end spike sorting pipeline that leverages parallelization to scale to large datasets. The same workflow can run reproducibly on individual workstations, high-performance computing clusters, or cloud environments, with computing resources tailored to each processing step to reduce costs and execution times. In addition, we introduce a benchmarking pipeline, also optimized for parallel processing, that enables systematic comparison of multiple sorting pipelines. Using this framework, we show that Kilosort4, a widely used spike sorting algorithm, outperforms Kilosort2.5 (Pachitariu et al. 2024). We also show that 7x lossy compression, which substantially reduces the cost of data storage, has minimal impact on spike sorting performance. Together, these pipelines address the urgent need for scalable and transparent spike sorting of electrophysiology data, reparing the field for the coming flood of multi-thousand-channel experiments.",

      "title": "Endosomal MrGPRX1 signaling sensitizes TRPV1 to enhance itch",
      "content": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and TRPV (transient receptor potential vanilloid) channels are crucial for signal transduction in physiological processes, including neurotransmission, pain, and itch. Downstream effectors of GPCR signaling can directly stimulate TRPV channels or enhance their sensitivity to stimuli, a process known as TRPV sensitization. Traditionally, GPCRs are activated at the cell surface by extracellular agonists, triggering signaling cascades. Recent evidence suggests GPCRs continue to signal from intracellular organelles. The human Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor X1 (MrGPRX1) is a GPCR expressed in primary sensory neurons involved in nociception and pruritus. Recent studies demonstrated how intracellular GPCR signaling regulates neuronal activity. However, there is no evidence characterizing MrGPRX1 trafficking or intracellular signaling. Herein, we characterized MrGPRX1 signaling within the endosomal network and its role in sensitizing TRPV1 channels to enhance itch signaling. Utilizing subcellular targeted biosensors, we demonstrated MrGPRX1 can traffic and signal from endosomes. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that MrGPRX1 internalizes following BAM8-22 stimulation. BRET assays revealed that MrGPRX1 activation induces Gq and {beta}-arrestin-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Inhibition of dynamin or clathrin blocked BAM8-22-induced MrGPRX1 endocytosis and decreased nuclear extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Calcium signaling confirmed that MrGPRX1-mediated TRPV1 sensitization is mediated by protein kinase C and ERK activation. Our findings reveal a novel role for MrGPRX1 endosomal signaling in TRPV1 sensitization. Understanding the mechanisms of MrGPRX1 signaling offers valuable insights into differentiating between pain and itch pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies for chronic pain and persistent itch.",

      "title": "Slow waves generation and propagation in a model of brain lesions",
      "content": "Slow waves (SWs), the hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, reflect the periodic occurrence of transient silent periods in cortical neurons (Down states). During NREM, SWs and Down states physiologically disrupt large-scale network interactions. Since early EEG studies, SWs have also been observed in awake patients after brain injury. Emerging evidence indicates that these intrusions of sleep-like activity interfere with ongoing network activity and contribute to motor and cognitive deficits; yet, the mechanisms governing the generation and spread of post-lesional SWs remain unclear. Here, we extend a neural mass model of EEG to capture transitions between wake-like and sleep-like dynamics and embed it in connectome-based networks with virtual lesions. This model supports that local disfacilitation, topology-dependent propagation, and synchrony-dependent amplification throughout the connectome are sufficient to produce post-lesional SWs. These mechanisms reproduce the spatial gradients of post-lesional SWs seen in patients and identify actionable targets for neuromodulation and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Characterization of mechanical tissue properties in post-mortem human brain using magnetic resonance elastography",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health condition that can cause neurological dysfunction to varying degrees depending on the nature of the mechanical insult. In biomechanical studies of TBI under high loading conditions, post-mortem human subjects (PMHS) are often used since ethical concerns prohibit such experiments in living human subjects. Because PMHS brains undergo significant changes following death, it is important to understand the relationship between the mechanical properties of PMHS brain tissue and living tissue. In this study, we performed magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) on three PMHS specimens to estimate the material properties of the cadaveric brain, namely the storage modulus and the loss modulus, as well as the resulting shear stiffness and damping ratio. We also performed longitudinal MRE scans on one of the PMHS over the span of two months to investigate the evolution of tissue properties with post-mortem degradation. In comparison to in vivo subjects of age range 70-75 years, a substantially higher stiffness (mean: 5.96kPa) and lower damping ratio (mean: 0.09) were found in PMHS models. This study also revealed an initial increase in shear stiffness up to the seventh day post-mortem, followed by a steady decrease by the fifty-eighth day. However, the damping ratio displayed an opposite trend to that of shear stiffness. These changes were heterogeneous across brain regions. The collected measurements and analysis elucidate the changes in mechanical properties in post-mortem subjects, and can be used to build and validate computational models of TBI.",
