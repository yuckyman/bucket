      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Triboelectric nanogenerators for neural data interpretation: bridging multi-sensing interfaces with neuromorphic and deep learning paradigms",
      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "title": "Targeting the parietal memory network with tDCS in MCI: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage in dementia related disorders. In that context, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) are subjected to neuropathological changes in MCI. Furthermore, alterations in parietal memory network (PMN) integrity and default mode network (DMN) also occur in MCI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuroprotective tool that might interfere with cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-MCI (aMCI) and Parkinson\u2019s disease-MCI (PD-MCI) when applied to DLPFC or LPC separately.MethodsThis is a randomized and controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS in 120 patients (60 aMCI and 60 PD-MCI). Firstly, all patients will be randomly (1:1) divided into two groups: DLPFC (30 aMCI; 30 PD-MCI) and LPC (30 aMCI, 30 PD-MCI) for tDCS stimulation. Secondly, they will classify randomly (2:1) real and sham groups for tDCS applied to once a day for 10 days over 2 weeks. The stimulation will be delivered with a 2-mA current frequency and will last 20\u202fmin. The primary outcome assessment for this study will be the change in score from baseline to the end of (14-days and 90\u202fdays follow-up) the tDCS application for the neurocognitive tests. Potential outcome parameters will be discussed in the light of current literature to contribute to the new area of personalized non-invasive brain stimulation research in neurodegenerative diseases at early stages. The results of this study are expected to shed light on the neural underpinnings and pro-cognitive outcomes of tDCS.

      "content": "IntroductionThis study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion, as well as various acupoints, on human autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and physical stress. The research further to identify effective intervention strategies for stress management and health maintenance.MethodsA Self-comparison design was conducted with healthy volunteers. Thirty-five volunteers received sequential 15-min interventions of moxibustion at ST36, acupuncture at CV12, and acupuncture at ST36, with a one-day washout period between interventions. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured to assess autonomic function, and heart rate (HR) and the physical stress index (PSI) were measured to assess stress levels.ResultsCompared with the baseline, acupuncture at ST36 increased the high-frequency power (HF), root mean square of the successive interval difference (RMSSD), instantaneous standard deviation of the R\u2013R interval (SD1), long-term standard deviation of the R\u2013R intervals (SD2), total power (TP), and standard deviation of the normal\u2013normal interval (SDNN). Acupuncture at CV12 increased RMSSD, SD1, SD2, TP and SDNN, with sustained effects for RMSSD and SD1 post-acupuncture, SD1/SD2 were increased post-acupuncture. The HRs of all three interventions decreased during the intervention, and remained sustained effects post-intervention. The PSI decreased during acupuncture and the stimulation at CV12 remained sustained effects post-acupuncture.ConclusionAcupuncture alleviates physical stress by regulating ANS activity, with distinct modulatory effects observed across different acupoints, indicating potential applications in stress management and health maintenance. Moxibustion demonstrates marked efficacy in reducing HR.Clinical trial registrationhttps://itmctr.ccebtcm.org.cn/mgt/search, ITMCTR2025001289.",

      "title": "Unexpected words that become your best memories: How sentential constraint and word expectedness affect memory retrieval",
      "content": "Much is known about how the strength of contextual support from strongly constraining (SC) and weakly constraining (WC) sentences influences the online processing of expected (EXP) and unexpected (UNEXP) sentence-ending words. In the present study, we investigated the long-term mnemonic consequences associated with the processing of contextually constraint words and used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the memory retrieval mechanisms at work. Furthermore, we investigated false memories for expected but unpresented words. If these unpresented words remained highly accessible in memory, their false recognition as familiar would manifest in a larger early frontal old/new effect, the putative ERP correlate of episodic familiarity. Behavioral results indicated that strongly expected and highly unexpected words were more likely to be recognized, whereas memory for moderately expected words was attenuated. However, the anticipated early frontal old/new effects in these conditions did not materialize. Instead, the retrieval of highly unexpected (SC-UNEXP) words was characterized by a late parietal old/new effect, reflecting a reliance on recollection-based processes. Unexpectedly, during retrieval SC-UNEXP words also evoked a late frontal positivity, a pattern usually associated with the inhibition of unpresented expected words during encoding. This suggests that the retrieval of these words reactivated inhibitory mechanisms akin to those activated during encoding. Additionally, expected lures that were correctly identified as new elicited a broadly distributed positive slow wave, indicative of recollective processing in support of a recall-to-reject strategy. This latter effect was observed irrespective of the predictive strength of the contextual support.",

      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "title": "Neural Entrainment in the Theta Band Predicts Groove Perception in Popular Music",
      "content": "When humans listen to popular music, they often feel 'the groove', which is a pleasurable urge to move along with music. Previous studies suggest that groove arises from the brain's entrainment to rhythmical patterns of music in the delta-theta and beta bands, which enables the brain to predict temporal structures. However, this notion has only been tested using simplified or artificial acoustic stimuli and melodies, rather than naturalistic popular music. In this study, we combined electroencephalography (EEG) measurements with two measures of neural entrainment to test whether neural entrainment in the delta, theta, and beta bands predicts individuals' groove ratings of musical and clapping stimuli, which served as a control. We presented nine pop music songs and twelve MIDI-based clapping rhythms, which participants rated for their groove perception on a 5-point scale. Our results show that music songs received very variable groove ratings while ratings of clapping stimuli showed less variability. Univariate analyses demonstrated that both music and clapping stimuli consistently entrained neural oscillations in the delta-theta bands, but not beta bands, as measured by intertrial phase coherence (ITPC) and stimulus-brain coherence (SBC). ITPC and SBC in the theta band weakly, but significantly correlated with groove ratings in fronto-central clusters. Decoding of groove ratings from multivariate spatio-temporal-spectral EEG patterns of entrainment with curve-fitting and machine-learning models predicted groove perception with high accuracy, up to 0.8 Pearson correlation, where combined patterns of inter-trial phase coherence appeared more informative than patterns of stimulus-brain coherence. Our results support the theory that the perception of groove is rooted in the brain's ability to entrain to ongoing dynamic temporal structures of music in the theta band. They further show that multivariate decoding models can be leveraged to predict subjective groove online from neural entrainment with high accuracy and temporal resolution. Summary - While participants (n = 30) rated their subjective groove perception of 9 popular songs and 12 MIDI clapping rhythms, we measured how their brains entrained to these musical stimuli using stimulus-brain coherence (SBC) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) measures. - Both stimulus types strongly entrained delta-theta (1-7 Hz) oscillations. In univariate analyses, also both stimulus types at fronto-central, beat-related frequencies significantly predicted groove ratings. - Multivariate decoding using EEG entrainment patterns predicted individual groove ratings far better (up to Pearson r = 0.8), with combined ITPC patterns providing the most information.",

      "title": "Old-New Recognition Memory Revisited",
      "content": "Identifying old items during recognition memory tasks elicits widespread cortical responses. Recent results suggest that a distributed network, labeled the Parietal Memory Network (PMN), responds to old items, potentially reflecting mnemonic familiarity. An independent, parallel line of evidence suggests that the same network responds to salient stimuli in non-mnemonic contexts, referring to the network as the Salience Network (SAL). Here, we examined responses during old-new recognition and non-mnemonic detection tasks in intensively scanned individuals to directly contrast component processes related to mnemonic familiarity with more general processes associated with target detection. In an oddball detection paradigm devoid of traditional memory demands, SAL/PMN was robustly activated. SAL/PMN was also activated by old words in a standard old-new recognition task, thus reproducing both previously reported effects. In a critical oppositional contrast, recognition was examined when the task was to detect uncommon old words versus when the task was to detect uncommon new words. SAL/PMN was activated during the detection of targets even when those targets were new items, consistent with a response to the task relevance of the targets not mnemonic familiarity. Exploratory analyses further suggested that a right-lateralized network, referred to as Frontoparietal Network B (FPN-B), responds to mnemonic familiarity. These results revise our understanding of brain networks contributing to old-new recognition separating component processes common to many forms of target detection task from processes preferentially associated with mnemonic history.",

      "title": "Cell-type-resolved NRXN1 isoforms across human brain tissues and hiPSC organoids",
      "content": "NRXN1 undergoes extensive alternative splicing that generates a highly diverse repertoire of isoforms, diversifying protein-protein interactions, shaping synaptic specialization, and contributing to neuropsychiatric disease when disrupted. However, the splicing landscape of NRXN1 across distinct human brain cell types remains poorly defined. Because NRXN1 expression level is relatively low in adult brains and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived neurons, single-cell Iso-seq RNA sequencing often provides insufficient coverage to capture its full isoform diversity, particularly across heterogeneous cell populations. To address this gap, we developed an integrative sequencing strategy that combines single-cell transcriptomics, targeted enrichment of NRXN1 transcripts, and long-read sequencing. This approach reveals a comprehensive catalog of cell-type resolved NRXN1 isoforms across adult and fetal human postmortem brains as well as hiPSC-derived cortical organoids. From the adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) region, our analyses reveal distinct splicing programs across interneuron subtypes, pyramidal neurons, and glial lineages. Comparisons between prenatal and adult brains indicate that NRXN1 isoform profiles are established during early development and remain stable throughout neuronal maturation. In hiPSC organoid models, splicing profiles partially mirror both developmental and mature brain patterns, with a subset of splice sites exhibiting cell type- and stage-specific divergence. In the cerebellum of an autism case and in organoids derived from schizophrenia patients, carrying non-recurrent heterozygous NRXN1 deletions, we identify disrupted isoform expression and mutant NRXN1alpha; isoforms and characterize their distribution across diverse cell types.

      "title": "The Cerebellum Implements an Oscillatory Forward Model for Accurate Motor Timing",
      "content": "Voluntary movements are composed of small sub-movements generated by pulsatile bursts of muscle activity at 4-10 Hz. These motor intermittencies synchronize with rhythmic brain activity and vary with movement velocity and sensory delays, suggesting they are a signature of a central oscillatory motor control mechanism. We hypothesized that these pulsatile movements arise from a cerebellar clocking mechanism- a neuronal timing process that flexibly adjusts its dynamics to maintain motor precision under temporal uncertainty. If so, cerebellar rhythms should modulate their influence on movement depending on cue predictability. To test this, we used optically pumped magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG), which enables high quality, movement tolerant recordings of the brain with dense cerebellar coverage. Six participants performed an auditory paced finger flexion-extension task at approximately 1 Hz with either regular or irregular cue timing to vary predictability. All participants exhibited clear 4-10 Hz intermittencies in their kinematics, synchronized to neural activity in the cerebellum and the posterior parietal cortex. Our connectivity analysis revealed for the first time, that cerebellar activity at this frequency, predominantly reflects sensory feedback, but during regular, predictable cueing, the cerebellum shifts to exert a greater feedforward influence on movement. Moreover, cerebellar oscillations were most persistently phase-aligned with motor intermittent rhythms during accurately timed actions, an effect that was absent under irregular cueing. These findings support the idea that the cerebellum implements an oscillatory forward model for motor timing and provide novel evidence for its ability to adjusting its role in coordinating sensorimotor integration according to sensory predictability. Motor intermittencies may thus represent the output of a cerebellar timing process that underpins precise voluntary action.",

      "title": "Precision neurodiversity: personalized brain network architecture as a window into cognitive variability",
      "content": "Precision neurodiversity marks a shift in neuroscience from pathological models to personalized frameworks that view neurological differences as adaptive variations. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the Personalized Brain Network architecture and its relationship with cognitive variability in both typical and neurodiverse populations. The study examines advancements in connectome-based prediction modeling, normative modeling, dynamic fingerprinting, and machine learning methods that characterize individual-specific neural networks. Recent findings indicate that the Personalized Brain Network profile reliably predicts cognitive, behavioral, and sensory phenomena. Additionally, deep generative models demonstrate high fidelity in synthesizing connective cells. Recent studies have identified distinct neurobiological subgroups in conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder that were previously undetectable by conventional diagnostic criteria. However, research has revealed significant network-level differences among these subgroups. Researchers have identified age-resistant biomarkers in specific brain regions, and genetic mutations significantly influence the connectivity patterns of individuals. Clinical applications span a range of neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and talent. Network variability predicts executive functioning, social perception, and sensory processing abilities. However, successful translation requires overcoming challenges related to statistical power, reproducibility, ethical implementation and community participation. The convergence of advanced neuroimaging, artificial intelligence, and personalized medicine offers unprecedented opportunities for tailored interventions, while celebrating neurological diversity as a source of human strength.",
