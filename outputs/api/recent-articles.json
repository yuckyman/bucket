      "content": "arXiv:2512.20129v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Authoring 3D scenes is a central task for spatial computing applications. Competing visions for lowering existing barriers are (1) focus on immersive, direct manipulation of 3D content or (2) leverage AI techniques that capture real scenes (3D Radiance Fields such as, NeRFs, 3D Gaussian Splatting) and modify them at a higher level of abstraction, at the cost of high latency. We unify the complementary strengths of these approaches and investigate how to integrate generative AI advances into real-time, immersive 3D Radiance Field editing. We introduce Dreamcrafter, a VR-based 3D scene editing system that: (1) provides a modular architecture to integrate generative AI algorithms; (2) combines different levels of control for creating objects, including natural language and direct manipulation; and (3) introduces proxy representations that support interaction during high-latency operations. We contribute empirical findings on control preferences and discuss how generative AI interfaces beyond text input enhance creativity in scene editing and world building.",

Therefore, numerous studies were conducted to examine communication patterns in esports teams. While non-verbal communication has been extensively investigated, research on assessing voice-based verbal communication patterns remains relatively understudied. In this study, we propose a framework that automatically assesses verbal communication patterns by constructing networks with utterances transcribed from voice recordings. Through a data collection study, we obtained 84 game sessions from five League of Legends teams and subsequently investigated how verbal communication patterns varied across different conditions. As a result, we revealed that esports players exhibited broader and more balanced participation in collaborative situations, increased utterances over time with the largest rise in decision making, and team-level differences that were contingent on effective professional training. Building upon these findings, this study provides a generalizable tool for analyzing effective team communication.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.19999v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This workshop explores innovative human-AI collaboration methodologies in HCI visual storytelling education through our established \"gap-and-fill\" approach. Drawing on Eastern aesthetic philosophies of intentional emptiness, including Chinese negative-space traditions, Japanese \"ma\" concepts, and contemporary design minimalism, we demonstrate how educators can teach students to maintain creative agency while strategically leveraging AI assistance. During this workshop, participants will experience a structured three-phase methodology: creating a human-led narrative foundation, identifying strategic gaps, and collaborating on AI enhancements. The workshop combines theoretical foundations with intensive hands-on practice, enabling participants to create compelling HCI visual narratives that demonstrate effective human-AI partnership. Through sequential art techniques, storyboarding exercises, and guided AI integration, attendees learn to communicate complex interactive concepts, accessibility solutions, and user experience flows while preserving narrative coherence and creative vision. Building on our successful workshops at ACM C&amp;C 2025, this session specifically addresses the needs of the Chinese HCI community for culturally informed and pedagogically sound approaches to AI integration in creative education.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.19926v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With the rise of AI-powered coding assistants, firms and programmers are exploring how to optimize their interaction with them. Research has so far mainly focused on evaluating output quality and productivity gains, leaving aside the developers' experience during the interaction. In this study, we take a multimodal, developer-centered approach to gain insights into how professional developers experience the interaction with Generative AI (GenAI) in their natural work environment in a firm. The aim of this paper is (1) to demonstrate a feasible mixed-method study design with controlled and uncontrolled study periods within a firm setting, (2) to give first insights from complementary behavioral and subjective experience data on developers' interaction with GitHub Copilot and (3) to compare the impact of interaction types (no Copilot use, in-code suggestions, chat prompts or both in-code suggestions and chat prompts) on efficiency, accuracy and perceived workload whilst working on different task categories. Results of the controlled sessions in this study indicate that moderate use of either in-code suggestions or chat prompts improves efficiency (task duration) and reduces perceived workload compared to not using Copilot, while excessive or combined use lessens these benefits. Accuracy (task completion) profits from chat interaction. In general, subjective perception of workload aligns with objective behavioral data in this study. During the uncontrolled period of the study, both higher cognitive load and productivity were perceived when interacting with AI during everyday working tasks. This study motivates the use of comparable study designs, in e.g. workshop or hackathon settings, to evaluate GenAI tools holistically and realistically with a focus on the developers' experience.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.19898v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Community participation is an important aspect of an individuals physical and mental well-being. This participation is often limited for persons with disabilities, especially those with ambulatory impairments due to the inability to optimally navigate the community. Accessibility is a multi-faceted problem and varies from person to person. Moreover, it depends on various personal and environmental factors. Despite significant research conducted to understand challenges faced by wheelchair users, developing an accessibility model for wheelchair users by identifying various characteristic features has not been thoroughly studied. In this research, we propose a three-dimensional model of accessibility and validate it through in-depth qualitative analysis involving semi-structured interviews and participatory action research. The outcomes of our studies validated many of our hypotheses about community access for wheelchair users and identified a need for more accessible path planning tools and resources. Overall, this research strengthened our three-dimensional User-Wheelchair-Environment model of accessibility.",

      "title": "Visualizing a Collective Student Model for Procedural Training Environments",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.19885v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visualization plays a relevant role for discovering patterns in big sets of data. In fact, the most common way to help a human with a pattern interpretation is through a graphic. In 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training the student interaction is more varied and complex than in traditional e-learning environments. Therefore, the visualization and interpretation of students' behaviors becomes a challenge. This motivated us to design the visualization of a collective student model built from student logs taken from 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training. This paper presents the design decisions that enable a suitable visualization of this model to instructors as well as a web tool that implements this visualization and is intended: to help instructors to improve their own teaching; and to enhance the tutoring strategy of an Intelligent Tutoring System. Then, this paper illustrates, with three detailed examples, how this tool can be used to those educational purposes. Next, the paper presents an experiment for validating the utility of the tool. In this experiment we show how the tool can help to modify the tutoring strategy of a 3D virtual laboratory. In this way, it is shown that the proposed visualization of the model can serve to improve the performance of students in 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.19832v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI's humanlike qualities are driving its rapid adoption in professional domains. However, this anthropomorphic appeal raises concerns from HCI and responsible AI scholars about potential hazards and harms, such as overtrust in system outputs. To investigate how technology workers navigate these humanlike qualities and anticipate emergent harms, we conducted focus groups with 30 professionals across six job functions (ML engineering, product policy, UX research and design, product management, technology writing, and communications). Our findings reveal an unsettled knowledge environment surrounding humanlike generative AI, where workers' varying perspectives illuminate a range of potential risks for individuals, knowledge work fields, and society. We argue that workers require comprehensive support, including clearer conceptions of ``humanlikeness'' to effectively mitigate these risks. To aid in mitigation strategies, we provide a conceptual map articulating the identified hazards and their connection to conflated notions of ``humanlikeness.''",

However, there are few studies that explore its potential for predicting student behavior in a procedural training environment. This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are firstly grouped into clusters. Then an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.19707v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) human partnerships-evaluating how AI agents enhance expert human performance-are increasingly studied. Though rarely evaluated in healthcare, an inverse approach is possible: AI benefiting from the support of an expert human agent. Here, we investigate both human-AI clinical partnership paradigms in the magnetic resonance imaging-guided characterisation of patients with brain tumours. We reveal that human-AI partnerships improve accuracy and metacognitive ability not only for radiologists supported by AI, but also for AI agents supported by radiologists. Moreover, the greatest patient benefit was evident with an AI agent supported by a human one. Synergistic improvements in agent accuracy, metacognitive performance, and inter-rater agreement suggest that AI can create more capable, confident, and consistent clinical agents, whether human or model-based. Our work suggests that the maximal value of AI in healthcare could emerge not from replacing human intelligence, but from AI agents that routinely leverage and amplify it.",

      "title": "Representation learning in cerebellum-like structures",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.10261v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Animals use past experiences to adapt future behavior. To enable this rapid learning, vertebrates and invertebrates have evolved analogous neural structures like the vertebrate cerebellum or insect mushroom body. A defining feature of these circuits is a large expansion layer, which re-codes sensory inputs to improve pattern separation, a prerequisite to learn non-overlapping associations between relevant sensorimotor inputs and adaptive changes in behavior. However, classical models of associative learning treat expansion layers as static, assuming that associations are learned through plasticity at the output synapses. Here, we review emerging evidence that also highlights the importance of plasticity within the expansion layer for associative learning. Because the underlying plasticity mechanisms and principles of this representation learning are only emerging, we systematically compare experimental data from two well-studied circuits for expansion coding -- the cerebellum granule layer and the mushroom body calyx. The data indicate remarkably similar interneuron circuits, dendritic morphology and plasticity mechanisms between both systems that hint at more general principles for representation learning. Moreover, the data show strong overlap with recent theoretical advances that consider interneuron circuits and dendritic computations for representation learning. However, they also hint at an interesting interaction of stimulus-induced, non-associative and reinforced, associative mechanisms of plasticity that is not well understood in current theories of representation learning. Therefore, studying expansion layer plasticity will be important to elucidate the mechanisms and full potential of representation learning for behavioral adaptation.",

      "title": "Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20481v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Deep Learning Classification of EEG Responses to Multi-Dimensional Transcranial Electrical Stimulation",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20319v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG).\n  Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses.\n  In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy.\n  These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use. In this spirit, we documented and open-sourced our datasets and codebase in full, to be used freely by the neuroscience and AI research communities, who may replicate our results with free tools like GitHub, Kaggle, and Colab.",

      "title": "Self-motion as a structural prior for coherent and robust formation of cognitive maps",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20044v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Most computational accounts of cognitive maps assume that stability is achieved primarily through sensory anchoring, with self-motion contributing to incremental positional updates only. However, biological spatial representations often remain coherent even when sensory cues degrade or conflict, suggesting that self-motion may play a deeper organizational role. Here, we show that self-motion can act as a structural prior that actively organizes the geometry of learned cognitive maps. We embed a path-integration-based motion prior in a predictive-coding framework, implemented using a capacity-efficient, brain-inspired recurrent mechanism combining spiking dynamics, analog modulation and adaptive thresholds. Across highly aliased, dynamically changing and naturalistic environments, this structural prior consistently stabilizes map formation, improving local topological fidelity, global positional accuracy and next-step prediction under sensory ambiguity. Mechanistic analyses reveal that the motion prior itself encodes geometrically precise trajectories under tight constraints of internal states and generalizes zero-shot to unseen environments, outperforming simpler motion-based constraints. Finally, deployment on a quadrupedal robot demonstrates that motion-derived structural priors enhance online landmark-based navigation under real-world sensory variability. Together, these results reframe self-motion as an organizing scaffold for coherent spatial representations, showing how brain-inspired principles can systematically strengthen spatial intelligence in embodied artificial agents.",
