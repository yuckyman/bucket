      "title": "Combinatorial protein barcodes enable self-correcting neuron tracing with nanoscale molecular context",
      "content": "Mapping nanoscale neuronal morphology with molecular annotations is critical for understanding healthy and dysfunctional brain circuits. Current methods are constrained by image segmentation errors and by sample defects (e.g., signal gaps, section loss). Genetic strategies promise to overcome these challenges by using easily distinguishable cell identity labels. However, multicolor approaches are spectrally limited in diversity, whereas nucleic acid barcoding lacks a cell-filling morphology signal for segmentation. Here, we introduce PRISM (Protein-barcode Reconstruction via Iterative Staining with Molecular annotations), a platform that integrates combinatorial delivery of antigenically distinct, cell-filling proteins with tissue expansion, multi-cycle imaging, barcode-augmented reconstruction, and molecular annotation. Protein barcodes increase label diversity by >750-fold over multicolor labeling and enable morphology reconstruction with intrinsic error correction. We acquired a [~]10 million m3 volume of mouse hippocampal area CA2/3, multiplexed across 23 barcode antigen and synaptic marker channels. By combining barcodes with shape information we achieve an 8x increase in automatic tracing accuracy of genetically labelled neurons. We demonstrate PRISM supports automatic proofreading across micron-scale spatial gaps and reconnects neurites across discontinuities spanning hundreds of microns. Using PRISM's molecular annotation capability, we map the distribution of synapses onto traced neural morphology, characterizing challenging synaptic structures such as thorny excrescences (TEs), and discovering a size correlation among spatially proximal TEs on the same dendrite. PRISM thus supports self-correcting neuron reconstruction with molecular context.",

      "title": "Exercise-induced DNA damage response and memory formation in mice",
      "content": "This study reveals that acute aerobic exercise enhances memory formation through a controlled DNA damage mechanism, offering crucial insights into Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention. This work challenges the traditional view that DNA damage is inherently harmful, demonstrating that minor, reversible DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) induced by exercise serve as necessary primers for memory consolidation - a mechanism that may be impaired in AD pathogenesis. AD affects 1 in 9 adults over 65, with ~95% being late-onset cases where up to 40% of risk factors are modifiable through lifestyle interventions like exercise. While exercise demonstrably lowers AD risk, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study provides a missing mechanistic link by showing how exercise-induced DNA damage repair systems could counteract the DNA damage accumulation and repair dysregulation that are established hallmarks of brain aging and AD. In data presented herein, young mice showed significantly higher SSB rates in active genomic regions compared to aged mice, suggesting the decline of a protective mechanism (i.e., hormesis) with aging - potentially explaining increased AD susceptibility in older adults. The present study also suggests that exercise-induced SSBs are not random cellular damage but precisely targeted events that occur at genes essential for neuroplasticity, synaptic function, and memory formation. These breaks activate PARP1 (Poly ADP ribose polymerase 1), a crucial DNA damage sensor that simultaneously initiates repair processes while facilitating transcriptional programs necessary for memory consolidation. This mechanism may represent how exercise \"primes\" the brain against the pathological DNA damage accumulation seen in AD. In support of this, in behavioral experiments, a single exercise bout converted sub-threshold learning into robust long-term memory formation. This memory enhancement correlated with upregulation of both neurotrophic genes (BDNF, Fos) and DNA repair enzymes (PARP1, PARP2), demonstrating coordinated damage-repair processes that appear compromised in AD. We identify HPF1 as a critical cofactor enabling PARP1 to perform trans-ADP-ribosylation of histones, linking DNA damage sensing to epigenetic chromatin remodeling required for memory-related gene expression. This pathway represents a novel therapeutic target for AD, as restoring efficient DNA repair mechanisms might slow or prevent memory loss.",

      "title": "Sustained dynamics of saccadic inhibition and adaptive oculomotor responses during continuous exploration",
      "content": "In natural environments, stimuli often recur across time and space, requiring the visual system to remain sensitive to novelty while managing predictability. A central question in systems neuroscience is how motor systems adapt to repeated sensory events without compromising responsiveness. We investigated this adaptive capacity using saccadic inhibition (SI), a reflexive suppression of eye movements triggered by sudden visual transients, as a probe of oculomotor dynamics during naturalistic viewing. Human participants (N = 21) freely explored visual arrays while brief gaze-contingent flashes appeared five times at random intervals, either foveally or parafoveally. SI reliably occurred ~120 ms post-flash across repetitions and locations, indicating robust sensory-driven inhibition. However, the rebound phase, reflecting saccade reprogramming, showed a progressive decline. In a second experiment (N = 19), only the first or the fifth flash was visible on each trial. In this case, neither inhibition nor rebound was altered, suggesting that the rebound decline is driven by repeated sensory stimulation rather than exploration time. This dissociation reveals selective habituation of motor re-engagement mechanisms, while reflexive inhibitory gating remains stable. We propose that inhibition is mediated by circuitry that transiently suppresses saccade initiation and resists habituation. By contrast, the weakening rebound reflects a separate, habituation-prone route that reduces saccade generation to irrelevant events. Functionally, this imbalance implies a recalibration within the saccade generator, preserving inhibitory capacity while constraining motor output. Our findings uncover a distinct form of oculomotor habituation and demonstrate how SI reveals dynamic decoupling of sensory input and motor output under repeated stimulation.",

      "title": "Postpartum enhancement of spatial learning and cognitive flexibility: an IntelliCage study",
      "content": "The transition to motherhood has been shown to result in significant changes in the structure and function of the brain, with particular emphasis on the enhancement of cognitive abilities that are essential for survival. Specifically, in murine models, spatial learning and cognitive flexibility have been identified as critical components of mothering. These abilities facilitate efficient navigation of the environment, resource acquisition, and responsiveness to offspring's needs. While cognitive enhancements during the postpartum period have been observed in various experimental setups, research using long-term data collection with automated monitoring in home cage setup is completely lacking even though it provides a more reliable approach than other experimental procedures. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by systematically examining spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in female mice during the reproductive stages using IntelliCage, with the objective of offering a more comprehensive understanding of maternal cognitive adaptations. Utilising the IntelliCage system, we observed that female mice in the postpartum phase outperformed pregnant and nulliparous females in place learning, reversal learning, and fixed schedule drinking tasks, demonstrating faster adaptation and superior retention of information. These paradigms mirror real-world challenges faced by mothers, such as navigating resources and balancing caregiving with self-maintenance. The enhanced performance demonstrated by the mothers could be attributed to their heightened motivation and cognitive abilities, potentially influenced by substantial hormonal shifts, which have been known to modify neuroplasticity in critical brain regions. The identification of these improvements in maternal behaviour may offer novel insights into the impact of reproductive experiences on brain function, with implications for maternal health and broader cognitive research.",

      "title": "PRRT2 as an auxiliary regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation",
      "content": "During sustained activity, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels enter a slow inactivation state to limit cellular hyperexcitability. Disruption of this regulatory process has been implicated in skeletal, cardiac and neurological disorders. While the kinetics of this process are well characterized, its endogenous modulators remain unclear. Here, we identify Proline-Rich Transmembrane Protein 2 (PRRT2) as a native regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation. We show that PRRT2 facilitates the entry of Nav channels into slow-inactivated state and delays their recovery, a regulatory effect conserved from zebrafish to humans. PRRT2 forms molecular complexes with Nav channels both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse cortex, PRRT2 deficiency impairs the slow inactivation of Nav channels in neuronal axons, leading to reduced cortical resilience in response to hyperexcitable challenges. Together, these findings establish PRRT2 as a physiological modulator of Nav channel slow inactivation and reveal a mechanism that supports cortical resilience to pathological perturbations.",

      "title": "Mapping the Structural Brain Network of Psychopathy: Convergent Evidence from Humans and Chimpanzees",
      "content": "Psychopathy, a condition characterized by profound emotional and interpersonal deficits, has long been hypothesized to stem, in part, from structural brain abnormalities. Yet, neuroimaging findings remain inconsistent. To address these discrepancies, we applied a novel structural network mapping approach combined with cross-species analyses. Traditional meta-analysis revealed weak spatial convergence across 20 samples. Nevertheless, we found that heterogeneous peak locations coalesced into a distributed set of regions encompassing the insular, and prefrontal cortices. This network overlapped strikingly (r = .93) with a lesion-derived network causally linked to antisocial behaviour, and variation within it predicted volumetric risk scores in both humans (n = 107, R2 = .16) and chimpanzees (n = 148, R2 = .21). These findings suggest that psychopathy reflects abnormalities across a collection of distributed regions rather than isolated areas, providing a unifying explanation for decades of inconsistent results and advancing our understanding of its clinical, biological, and evolutionary bases.",

      "title": "Tmem117, an oligodendrocyte-enriched regulator of NCX activity, links myelin homeostasis to counterregulation and metabolic health.",
      "content": "The counterregulatory response (CRR) to hypoglycemia is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanism orchestrated by the central nervous system (CNS) to ensure survival during glucose scarcity. In individuals with diabetes, this response is frequently impaired, contributing to life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemia. Tmem117 was previously identified in a genetic screen as a promising hypothalamic regulator of CRR. Our previous work highlighted its contribution to CRR through regulation of vasopressin secretion. Here, we reveal that Tmem117 is also enriched in cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage and we characterize the contribution of oligodendrocytic Tmem117 in CRR. We show that depletion of Tmem117 from either all oligodendrocyte lineage cells or only mature oligodendrocytes leads to myelin deficits and male-specific defects in CRR. Furthermore, we reveal that transient, adult-onset depletion of Tmem117 in mature oligodendrocytes is sufficient to induce long-lasting metabolic imbalances in male mice, suggesting that defects in oligodendrocytes and myelin can affect peripheral glucose homeostasis. Mechanistically, we provide for the first-time insights on the function of Tmem117 showing that it regulates intracellular calcium dynamics through its interaction with the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1. Together, these results redefine our understanding of the cellular contributors to the CRR, highlight the importance of oligodendrocytes in systemic glucose regulation, and position Tmem117 as a promising molecular target for cell-specific manipulation of NCX activity.",

      "title": "Temporal basis function models for closed-loop neural stimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Further advancements are required to address a number of difficulties with translating AI to this domain, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. Approach. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials measured in two non-human primates. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient ( \u2009min of training data), rapid to train ( \u2009min), and low latency ( \u2009ms) on desktop CPUs. Main results. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. Surprisingly, on test sets it achieved a prediction accuracy 44% higher than a complex nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and 158% higher than a linear state-space model requiring 90\u2009min to train. Additionally, in two simulations we show that it successfully allows a closed-loop stimulator to drive neural trajectories, and to achieve the user-preferred trade-offs between under- and over-stimulation, given the uncertainty in the model; it achieves an area under curve of \u223c0.7 in both cases. Significance. By optimizing for sample efficiency, training time, and latency, our approach begins to bridge the gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
