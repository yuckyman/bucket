      "title": "Neuritin: a multifaceted neuroprotective factor with emerging applications for neurodegeneration",
      "content": "Neuritin is a conserved, activity-regulated gene encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, crucial for neural development, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. Identified via activity-dependent gene screening in the rat hippocampus, neuritin promotes neurite outgrowth, dendritic arborization, and synaptic maturation with neural activity. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding neuritin\u2019s signaling pathways, neuroprotective, neuroregenerative, and neuromodulatory properties, with a focus on its therapeutic potential to counter neurodegeneration in various conditions such as glaucoma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke, diabetic neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, recent studies reveal roles in immunoregulation, angiogenesis, and cancer biology, highlighting neuritin as a versatile signaling molecule with broad therapeutic implications.",

      "title": "Auditory object segmentation amplifies prediction error signals in a complex MMN paradigm",
      "content": "Auditory deviance detection depends on the segmentation of sound sequences into perceptually meaningful units, which provide the basis for predictive models. Complex mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigms, including dual-rule designs, place higher demands on these processes because regularities are defined by relationships across tones rather than by single features. However, it remains unclear how facilitation of auditory segmentation influences MMN. To address this, we compared MMN elicited during a dual-rule paradigm under continuous versus temporally segmented (750\u202fms gap) conditions in thirty-two participants using simultaneous EEG and MEG recordings. Two 50-ms binaural pure tones were presented in pairs. Tone A was a 1\u202fkHz stimulus biased to the right ear, and Tone B was a 1.2\u202fkHz stimulus biased to the left ear. Within each pair, tones followed with a 330\u202fms Stimulus Onset Asynchrony (SOA), with standards consisting of A-B pairs (85.6%) and deviants of A-A pairs (14.3%). Two conditions were used: a No-Gap condition, where pairs followed continuously with a 330\u202fms SOA, and a Gap condition, where pairs were separated by a longer 750\u202fms SOA. Results at EEG FCz revealed dual-rule MMN amplitudes (130\u2013230\u202fms) were not significantly different between No-Gap and Gap conditions (t(29)\u202f=\u202f0.93; p\u202f=\u202f0.36; d\u202f=\u202f0.17). Conversely, MEG source-localized responses in bilateral primary auditory cortex (A1) revealed larger MMN responses in the Gap condition relative to No-Gap (F(1,31)\u202f=\u202f26.07, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, \u03b7p2 = 0.457). This suggests that temporal segmentation facilitates the grouping of tone pairs into perceptual objects, allowing the auditory system to form predictions not only at the level of individual tones, but also at the level of the tone pair as a perceptual unit. Deviants in this context violate both low-level features (pitch and location) and the higher-order pair structure, producing larger prediction error signals. These results provide insight into how the auditory system integrates local and higher-order regularities, offering a mechanistic link between auditory scene analysis and hierarchical predictive coding in complex auditory environments.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

To accomplish this, <em>Neuropsychology</em> needs to build on specific areas of strength. Accordingly, a revised statement of aims and scope of <em>Neuropsychology</em>, based on a detailed bibliographic review of <em>Neuropsychology</em> and comparison with similar journals, will be unveiled by Dr. Woods in his first issue as Editor in January of 2026. The revised aims and scope will help differentiate <em>Neuropsychology</em> from other similar journals. The current editor is pleased that the examination of brain\u2013behavior relationship in the context of cultural factors and social determinants of health will continue to be recognized as of particular interest, building on the increases in these domains over the past 5 years.

      "title": "Behavioral tinnitus in gerbils is associated with reduced spontaneous rates in single auditory-nerve fibers",
      "content": "Tinnitus is often initiated by damage to the peripheral auditory system, for example by overexposure to loud sounds. Animal studies have shown that such noise-induced tinnitus is related to increased spontaneous activity in the brainstem dorsal cochlear nucleus as well as further along the central auditory pathway. However, the role of spontaneous activity of the auditory nerve, connecting the peripheral and central auditory systems, in tinnitus and brainstem hyperactivity remains unknown. In the current study, tinnitus was induced by exposing anesthetized Mongolian gerbils to a 115-dB SPL narrowband noise. After one day of recovery, animals were behaviorally tested for gap detection deficits using a gap-prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (GPIAS) paradigm, indicative of tinnitus. Ipsilateral noise-induced threshold shifts did not differ between animals with and without signs of tinnitus. Interestingly, single auditory nerve fibers that were recorded from animals with signs of tinnitus had significantly reduced spontaneous rates compared to both noise-exposed animals without signs of tinnitus and sham-exposed animals. Furthermore, spontaneous rate reduction was specific to fibers with a best frequency within the frequency bands that showed gap detection deficits. On the other hand, inter-spike interval variability and bursting behavior increased in fibers from noise-exposed compared to sham-exposed animals but did not differ with gap detection deficits. These findings suggest that tinnitus-related central hyperactivity may be provoked by reduced spontaneous rates of its innervating auditory nerve fibers. This is consistent with current models explaining the central manifestation of tinnitus, such as the stochastic resonance and central gain models, and allows for a more detailed definition of specifically tinnitus-related deafferentation.",
