      "content": "Emotions play a crucial role in shaping cognitive performance, yet their influence on programing remains understudied. This pilot study investigates the relationship between emotional states and coding task quality. Ten participants completed a programing task while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG), with frontal alpha asymmetry (FAI) applied as a neural marker of emotional valence. Emotional self-reports were collected using the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience (SPANE), and coding quality was evaluated through a structured rubric. Preliminary findings indicate a potential association between FAI and coding performance, whereas self-reported affect showed weaker or inconsistent patterns. Given the small sample size (n = 10), these results should be interpreted as exploratory. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating EEG-based emotional measures into software engineering research and lays the groundwork for larger-scale investigations into how emotions influence coding task quality.",

      "title": "Disruption of global brain network topology in amnestic MCI: evidence from multimodal DTI and fMRI",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study aims to utilize multimodal neuroimaging techniques to simultaneously analyze global topological properties of white matter structural networks and resting-state functional networks in aMCI patients, comparing them with healthy controls. By conducting independent and integrative analyses of topological impairments in both networks, we seek to systematically characterize the multimodal network disruption patterns in aMCI.Methods45 aMCI patients and 42 healthy adults from the First Affiliated Hospital of Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, China, were enrolled. A case-control cross-sectional study was conducted. DTI and rs-fMRI data were collected for all participants. Global topological properties of structural and functional networks were constructed using PANDA and dpabi software and were calculated via graph-theoretical analysis in GRETNA software, followed by statistical comparisons between groups.ResultsIn patients with aMCI, the small-world (Cp, aCp, Lambda, aLambda) of the WM structural network were significantly higher than those in the HC group; Rich-club nodes showed redistribution, and the Rich-club coefficient was decreased; aEloc was significantly increased; the Assortativity index (r < 0) indicated disassortativity; the Hierarchy index (b > 0) exhibited a significant decrease in b within the sparsity range of 0.39\u223c0.4; the synchronization coefficient (s) was significantly reduced at sparsity levels ranging from 0.28 to 0.30. For the functional network, the small-world index aLp in the aMCI group was significantly lower than that in the HC group; Rich-club nodes showed redistribution, and the Rich-club coefficient was increased within a certain Degree range; aEg was significantly increased; the Assortativity index (r > 0) indicated assortativity; the Hierarchy index (b > 0) was observed within a specific sparsity range.ConclusionWe identified a \u201cstructure-function dissociation\u201d in aMCI, where the structural network suffers from fragmentation and hub disruption, while the functional network compensates through rigid, hyper-localized reorganization with elevated local efficiency. This divergence reveals a core pathological mechanism of the disease.",

      "content": "Depression, one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders, continues to pose escalating global health challenges. Despite the discovery of numerous antidepressants, their clinical applications are limited, and there is still an urgent need to identify more effective antidepressant drugs and their molecular targets. In recent years, sigma receptors have garnered considerable interest among depression researchers because of their diverse biological functions and significant roles in the central nervous system. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the potential roles of sigma receptors and their ligands in the pathogenesis of depression and the course of antidepressant treatment, with the aim of offering insights into further research and potential therapeutic development.",

      "title": "Muscle responses to limb block during spontaneous movements in infants",
      "content": "Young infants manifest prominent neuromuscular responses to changes in muscle length, along with a variety of spontaneous movements. The first months of life are an important period during which sensorimotor integration and muscle tone gradually mature. In adults, muscle responses may also be observed when coordinated limb movements are transiently blocked. Given that infants normally exhibit spontaneous limb activity, here we examined whether a transient upper or lower limb block evoked consistent muscle responses while the infants were allowed to perform spontaneous movements with the other limbs. We examined polymyographic recordings in 12 bilateral arm and leg muscles in full-term and preterm infants (1\u20137\u202fmonths old). Overall, muscle activity, its spectral characteristics, and agonist\u2013antagonist coactivation were comparable before and after the block in both full-term and preterm infants, suggesting that the transient limb immobilization effect is not evident or consistent, as opposed to previously reported prominent muscle responses to muscle lengthening or shortening. The lack of consistent muscular responses to limb block supports the idea that individual limb motion during spontaneous movements is relatively independent of the control of other limbs, and that sensory input during changes in muscle length is more effective in revealing sensorimotor connections than its non-appearance.",

      "title": "A rational information gathering account of infant habituation.",
      "content": "Gaze is one of the primary experimental measures for studying cognitive development, especially in preverbal infants. However, the field is only beginning to develop a principled explanatory framework for making sense of the various factors affecting gaze. We approach this issue by addressing infant gaze from first principles, using rational information gathering. In particular, we revisit the influential descriptive account of Hunter and Ames (1988), which posits a set of regularities argued to govern how gaze preference for a stimulus changes with experience and other factors. When the Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) model is reconsidered from the perspective of rational information gathering (as recently also proposed by other authors), one feature of the model emerges as surprising: that preference for a stimulus is not monotonic with exposure. This claim, which has at least some empirical support, is in contrast to most statistical measures of informativeness, which strictly decline with experience. We present a normative, computational theory of visual exploration that rationalizes this and other features of the classic account. Our account suggests that Hunter and Ames\u2019s (1988) signature nonmonotonic pattern is a direct manifestation of a ubiquitous principle of the value of information in sequential tasks, other consequences of which have recently been observed in a range of settings including deliberation, exploration, curiosity, and boredom. This is that the value of information gathering, putatively driving gaze, depends on the interplay of a stimulus\u2019 informativeness (called gain, the focus of other rationally motivated accounts) with a second factor (called need) reflecting the estimated chance that information will be used in the future. This computational decomposition draws new connections between infant gaze and other cases of exploration, and offers novel, quantitative interpretations and predictions about the factors that may impact infant exploratory attention.

      "content": "Evidence has shown that sex differences affect the symptoms and the response to treatments in neuropsychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Extinction, as a therapeutic method, and reinstatement, as a method that facilitates shock-related memory retrieval, may also be affected by sex differences; however, evidence is sparse. The present study aimed to explore the potential role of sex differences in the effect of extinction and reinstatement on behavioral functions in a rat model of PTSD. Fear learning was induced by three consecutive footshocks (0.8 mA, 3 s, paired with three sounds) on Day 1. Extinction training (20 sounds without footshock) was done 1 hr and 24 hr after footshocks. Reinstatement was done on Day 3, or 10, or 20, or 30, by placing rat in a new context and delivering one footshock (0.8 mA, 3 s, no sound). Results showed that females were more responsive to extinction due to significant decreases in freezing behavior in comparison with males, while reinstatement had more effect to recall shock-related memory in males. Pain threshold was increased and extinction decreased it in both sexes. Locomotion was decreased in fear conditioning group in both sexes and in PTSD + extinction males, while it was not changed in PTSD + extinction females. Reinstatement on Day 3 decreased locomotion in males. Rearing was decreased and extinction restored it in both sexes. By contrast, reinstatement on Day 3 decreased rearing in males. In conclusion, we suggested that females are more responsive to extinction and less sensitive to reinstatement. On the contrary, males are sensitive to reinstatement.

      "title": "Chemogenetic modulation of PAC1-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) alters anxiety-related behaviors in male mice.",
      "content": "Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, <em>ADCYAP1</em>) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that plays essential roles in numerous physiological functions, and central PACAP signaling has been associated with mechanisms regulating stress-induced psychopathologies. PACAP binds to several receptor subtypes, including PAC1 (<em>ADCYAP1R1</em>), VPAC1 (<em>VIPR1</em>), and VPAC2 (<em>VIPR2</em>), to activate several signaling cascades that can alter neuronal excitability and enhance indices of neuroplasticity, and much of our prior work has suggested that the anxiogenic effects of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) PACAP depend on the activation of PAC1 receptors. To complement our previous work that evaluated the roles of BNST PACAP expression and secretion in anxiety-related responses, we employed in the current work chemogenetic approaches in male PAC1-Ires-Cre mice to directly and specifically modulate the activities of BNST PAC1 receptor-expressing neurons. Inhibition of BNST PAC1 receptor neuron activity with clozapine-N-oxide significantly increased open arm exploration without reducing total locomotor activity; conversely, stimulating BNST PAC1 receptor function significantly reduced open arm exploratory activities. In sum, these data are consistent with our prior work suggesting a key role for BNST PACAP receptor activation in anxiety and stress; further, these observations importantly clarify the neural circuits involved in anxiety-like behaviors.

      "title": "Conditioned place preferences for virtual reality cannabis cues.",
      "content": "This study investigated whether 221 undergraduates (123 males, 98 females) with varying levels of cannabis use displayed a conditioned place preference (CPP) for a virtual reality (VR) room that previously contained virtual cannabis stimuli compared to a neutral VR room that was not paired with cannabis cues. We hypothesized that cannabis-using participants (<em>n</em> = 180) would spend a greater amount of time in, report greater subjective enjoyment in, and explicitly prefer a VR room that was previously paired with virtual cannabis stimuli relative to a neutral room, while participants with nonuse (<em>n</em> = 41) would not. Overall, participants did not demonstrate an implicit or explicit CPP for a VR room that was previously paired with cannabis cues. Interestingly, however, participants with recent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 41) exhibited a significant implicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired VR room, while participants with nonrecent cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 113) did not. Furthermore, relative to males with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 93), females with cannabis use (<em>n</em> = 87) demonstrated a significant explicit CPP for the cannabis-cue-paired context as well as significantly greater cannabis cravings. These findings elucidate the need for further research on the role of acute cannabis intoxication, sex, and cue-induced cravings in modulating CPP for cannabis-associated contexts.

      "title": "Paraventricular thalamic inputs to the ventral pallidum shape reward seeking during threat and fear responding in extinction.",
      "content": "Environmental threats are typically encountered when animals are searching for food and other necessities. Adaptive behavior must balance competition between fear behavior and reward seeking. We gave rats local neuronal deletions of the ventral pallidum (VP) or specifically deleted paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons projecting directly to the VP. Rats were then assessed in a conditioned suppression procedure in which cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities were presented during, but independent from, reward seeking. Foot shock introduction generally suppressed reward seeking in rats, and recovery from shock introduction was facilitated in rats with VP or PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletions. Discriminative fear was observed in controls, and this fear responding reduced over a single extinction session. VP deletion enhanced extinction fear responding, and PVT \u2192 VP pathway deletion abolished within-session fear reductions. The results demonstrate the VP and its inputs from the PVT shape reward seeking in threat settings and govern fear extinction responding.

      "title": "Patterns of prefrontal cortical activity associated with attention-demanding and motor aspects of dual-task walking as measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy.",
      "content": "The ability to engage in everyday tasks, such as walking, requires the integration of cognitive and motor processes. How these processes integrate may be discernable through the relation of brain activity patterns to behavioral performance, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), examination of which has been restricted because of the limitations in experimental design. We related behavior (cognition, walking) to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions (cognition while walking) in healthy young adults. Our probe design enabled us to examine eight regions of interest across PFC and motor cortex to identify key areas related to behavior. Healthy young adults (N = 19) engaged in standing cognition (Serial 3 subtraction), single-task walking, and dual-task walking. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify regions associated with increases or decreases in activity under dual-task relative to the other conditions. We observed differences in brain activity patterns by task across multiple regions of interest, mostly in PFC. Specifically, more lateral regions were related to attention-demanding tasks, whereas motor tasks were related to relatively medial regions. Our results relate behavior to brain activity, as measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy, under dual-task conditions. Our finding of relatively lateral PFC activity during attention-demanding tasks provides insights into behavioral and brain processes during experimental analogues of everyday activity, bringing us closer to understanding behavior-brain relations in the real world.
