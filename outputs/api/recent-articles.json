      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Proteomic Profiling Defines Robust Molecular Subtypes Underlying the Heterogeneity of Parkinson's Disease",
      "content": "Heterogeneity of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology is a barrier to developing therapeutics and understanding progression and prognosis. High throughput proteomic measures can be used to better interpret PD pathophysiology and generate clusters to define disease subtypes. Identification of subtypes related to clinical phenotypes will help researchers understand PD progression. We analyzed longitudinal proteomic data from the Tracking Parkinson's Cohort, consisting of recent-onset PD patients across 72 UK sites. 794 patients were measured on the Somalogic platform (7596 proteins) for three time points. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) at each time point revealed consistent protein co-expression modules. Two modules were strongly preserved across all three time points and in validation in the Global Neurodegenerative Proteomics Consortia (GNPC) datasets. The brown module was enriched for metabolite pathways and the blue module with cellular signaling pathways and associated with quality of life scores. Conversely, the smaller red module had distinct cognitive function phenotypes and changed protein expression between visit time points. Using detailed characterization of proteomic clusters we have provided a comprehensive view of PD progression offering deeper insights into the conservation of proteomic expression, suggesting new module subsets and providing candidate target proteins for further study.",

      "content": "The goal for the motor action represents the desired state of the individual to interact with world. Investigating how the goal is generated requires clarifying spatial extrapolation that involves perceptual and action processes. Here, we recorded neural activity from monkeys manually intercepting a circularly moving target being occluded. The saliency and intentional maps, which developed to locate the target of interest and the intended action goal, were thus distinguished in neural activity recorded from the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) and parietal reach region (PRR). Dynamic internal representations spanning from visual registration to state estimation were unveiled in both areas, with the goal for the interception being inferred as the visual consequence of the movement. The motion extrapolation was found to be an intrinsic part of movement planning so that the continuous and stable spatial extrapolation from motion to action was prevalent in both areas. The goal estimation based on the sensory extrapolation rationalized the concurrency and correlation of saliency and intentional maps, which were found to switch their dominance by reorganizing the read-out dimensions of the spatial manifold. The extrapolation achieved at both the perceptual and motor stages not only bridged the saliency and intentional maps, but also revealed the form of the state estimation in guiding predictive sensorimotor control.",

      "title": "Memory network activity flow failures in temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy",
      "content": "Declarative memory deficits represent considerable challenges to adequate functioning and wellbeing in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE), two of the most common pharmaco-resistant epilepsies. TLE and FLE are impacted differently however, with TLE affecting primarily episodic, and mildly semantic memory, while FLE presenting with overall lesser declarative impairments and a greater involvement of language processes. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are overall compatible with differential disruptions of medial temporal and fronto-limbic networks in both syndromes, direct comparisons of brain activity and connectivity remain scarce. The current study investigated how alterations in intrinsic functional brain organization, as mapped with resting-state connectivity (rsFC), shapes altered brain network activations in both episodic and semantic memory states. To this end, we acquired task- and rs-fMRI data in 28 TLE patients and 17 FLE patients and 87 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs). We used activity flow mapping (AFM), a generative machine learning technique that derives plausible task activation patterns via individualized rsFC as well as normative task activation data. Previous studies in HC as well as patient populations have shown that this technique has been effective in identifying mechanisms contributing to atypical functional organization across different context. Overall, AFM reliably predicted task activations across HC, TLE, and FLE, but prediction accuracy was consistently reduced in both patient groups, indicating impaired propagation of task-relevant signals. These reductions co-occurred with abnormal episodic and semantic task activation patterns, atypical rsFC, and behavioral profiles marked by preserved semantic but impaired episodic memory performance in both patient groups. Importantly, although neither task-evoked abnormalities nor rsFC disruptions alone were associated with clinical variables, lower AFM accuracy in patients robustly tracked poorer episodic and semantic memory performance and longer disease duration. Prediction accuracy was driven more by intrinsic functional than structural network features, suggesting that altered network communication, rather than gross anatomy, constrains AFM in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. Our work revealed syndrome-specific yet convergent disruptions in paralimbic and heteromodal association systems, linking intrinsic dysconnectivity to a shared episodic vulnerability and semantic resilience across TLE and FLE. By modelling how intrinsic connectivity shapes task-evoked responses, AFM provides a mechanistic account of imbalanced memory-state activations and isolates network-flow pathways as targets for intervention and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Spatiotemporal multi-omics atlas of the aging neuromuscular junction",
      "content": "The demographic shift toward a global aging population, coupled with rising prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, poses major public health challenges. Aging is the primary risk factor for most neurodegenerative conditions, making the elucidation of its molecular mechanisms critical for developing effective interventions. Dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the specialized synapse essential for motor function, is an early hallmark of aging and several neurodegenerative disorders, yet its molecular determinants remain incompletely understood. To shed light on potential common underlying mechanisms, we performed a spatiotemporal multiomics analysis of the murine NMJ during aging, uncovering several genes showing decoupling between transcript and protein trajectories that may drive the related progressive motor decline. NMJs of soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles, differing in fiber composition and vulnerability to aging and disease, displayed distinct spatiotemporal dynamics: fast-twitch EDL, more susceptible to degeneration, exhibited stronger mRNA-protein decoupling than aged slowtwitch SOL or younger SOL and EDL muscles. Elevated expression of miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins in aged EDL highlights the key role of post-transcriptional regulation in NMJ aging. This study provides new insights into the physiopathology of neuromuscular aging and offers a resource for investigating mechanisms shared between aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, it opens avenues for AI-driven discovery of drug targets and early biomarkers, potentially accelerating the development of therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Reevaluating the Role of Beta2-Microglobulin: New Insights on Selective Vulnerability in ALS Pathology",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons (MNs). Why these neurons show particular vulnerability in ALS is still debated, and also why certain MNs remain resilient. We investigated the importance of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and particularly beta2-microglobulin (b2m) in MN susceptibility to ALS as these molecules have been implicated both in prolonging and shortening disease. RNA-sequencing demonstrated that disease-resistant oculomotor neurons (OMNs) and Onuf nucleus MNs had similar b2m and HLA mRNA levels to vulnerable spinal MNs in control tissues. Thus, baseline differences in these transcripts do not explain the differential vulnerabilities of these neurons to disease. Nonetheless, the HLA protein level showed an inverse correlation with spinal MN size, where large MNs, which are lost early in ALS, had low HLA levels. HLA protein levels were also reduced in end-stage ALS patient spinal MNs, while remaining unchanged in OMNs with disease. Spinal MNs uniquely exhibited a significant upregulation of b2m and HLA-C transcripts with disease, likely as a protective compensatory response. Thus, b2m and HLA may relate to vulnerability to ALS. Cross-breeding of b2m knockout mice with SOD1G93A ALS mice resulted in modest transient worsening of functional motor performance, but did not affect life span. There was partial preservation of innervation of particular muscles in SOD1G93A mice lacking b2m, which was insufficient to improve motor behavior. These findings indicate that b2m and HLAs are dynamically regulated in ALS, and may influence MN vulnerability, but they are not major disease modifiers in ALS.",

      "title": "Dorsomedial hypothalamus cold-sensitive neurons drive shivering thermogenesis",
      "content": "Shivering thermogenesis is the body 's response to cold, where the hypothalamus signals muscle contractions to generate heat. While cold-responsive neurons in the preoptic area and ventromedial hypothalamus are known to regulate thermogenesis, the specific neurons driving shivering thermogenesis remain unclear. Here, we identify a subset of VGLUT2-positive excitatory neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMHVglut2), enriched with Calbindin D28k (CALB1) expression (DMHCalb1/Vglut2), that selectively initiate cold-evoked shivering thermogenesis. When core body temperature (Tcore) dropped to 33{degrees}C, c-Fos expression peaked in the DMH. RNA sequencing of retrogradely labelled DMH neurons, traced through cervical muscles, revealed CALB1 and VGLUT2 expression in these neurons. Activation or inhibition of DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons specifically affected shivering thermogenesis, while modulation of DMHVglut2 neurons influenced Tcore through both shivering and non-shivering thermogenesis. Activation of CALB1-negative, VGLUT2-positive DMH neurons impacted non-shivering thermogenesis, confirming that DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons drive shivering. DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons exhibited cold temperature-dependent firing, with 23% peaking at 35{degrees}C, 27% at 34{degrees}C, and 50% at 33{degrees}C, explaining the hierarchical increase in shivering intensity during cold exposure. Their activation relies on the cold receptor TRPM8. Knockdown of TRPM8 expression in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons in vivo reduced cold-evoked shivering. Pharmacological activation or inhibition of TRPM8 in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons in vitro, respectively, reduced or enhanced cold temperature-dependent firing. These effects were eliminated when TRPM8 was knocked down in DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons. Inhibition of DMHCalb1/Vglut2 neurons prevented counteractive shivering, enabled rapid hypothermia, and protected the ischemic brain. This work revealed the central control mechanism of shivering and provided a potential strategy for controlled therapeutic hypothermia.",

      "title": "Graded Hair Cell Ablation Reveals Functional Redundancy in the Mature Mouse Vestibular System",
      "content": "Inner ear hair cells are mechanoreceptors critical for hearing and balance. Damage to vestibular hair cells causes balance impairment, yet it is unclear whether hair cell loss correlates with vestibular dysfunction. In this study, we ablated hair cells in Pou4f3DTR/+ mice with diphtheria toxin (DT), and found a dose-dependent decrease in hair cell survival in both the macula and crista ampullaris, including loss of type I and II hair cells in the striolar/central and extrastriolar/peripheral regions. Responses to linear acceleration, measured by the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex (tVOR) and vestibular sensory evoked potential (VsEP), were intact with 25% or more hair cell survival in the macula, and diminished only when hair cell survival decreased further. By contrast, rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (rVOR) responses were significantly reduced with ~31% hair cell survival in the cristae. Further, single-unit recordings of vestibular afferents from cristae and maculae showed more irregular and reduced firing rates, but only those corresponding to cristae displayed reduced sensitivity to head rotation. Limited hair cell regeneration was observed in the extrastriolar/peripheral regions of both maculae and cristae 6 months post ablation, although no significant recovery of the VORs was observed. Thus, the adult mouse vestibular end organs display different degrees of redundancy, demonstrating robust responses to head rotation and linear acceleration despite loss of most hair cells.",

      "title": "An integrated biobehavioral study of empathy",
      "content": "Empathy, a crucial prosocial human trait, is mainly measured through questionnaires, but performance in tasks involving emotional stimuli, brain activity during these tasks, and genetic information also provide relevant clues. These approaches are developed separately or by combining only some of these factors. Integrating them into a single study and analysis may help to better characterize their relative load and to understand the complexity of empathy. The IRI empathy scale was administered to 65 participants, who later performed a lexical decision task on emotional words while their performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Three genetic polymorphisms, one in the OXTR gene (SNP rs2254298) and two in the AVPR1a gene (RS1 and RS3 regions), were also analyzed. Generalized linear models revealed that these biobehavioral factors jointly predicted emotional but not cognitive empathy. Reaction times and the amplitude of the LPP component of ERPs in response to emotional words, along with rs2254298 AA/AG genotype, were significantly associated with scores on the IRI personal distress subscale. Meanwhile, LPP amplitudes and AVPR1a-RS1 LL genotype significantly predicted scores on the empathy concern subscale. The balanced loading of all these factors in the models reinforces the desirability of a comprehensive, multifaceted approach to characterizing empathy.",

      "title": "Nuclear RNA Clusters Are Dynamic Structural Entities in Huntington's Disease.",
      "content": "Huntington's disease research has focused on a toxic protein gain-of-function as the main driver of pathology. The role of mutant HTT mRNA in vivo has been only partially studied and remains largely unexplored. Recently, we discovered that fully processed human HTT mRNA is retained, together with the alternatively processed HTT1a transcript, in RNA nuclear clusters in YAC128 mouse brains. Here, we demonstrate that these clusters were already present in the prenatal stage at day 14.5, indicating early developmental effects. Moreover, these clusters were confined to neurons, implying a neuron-specific mechanism of accumulation, and were colocalised with Prpf8, a core spliceosomal protein, suggesting potential impact on nuclear homeostasis. HTT nuclear RNA clusters showed remarkable dynamics, rapidly dissolving when ionic interactions were disrupted or transcription and splicing were inhibited. This malleability underscores the accessibility of HTT mRNA to therapeutic interventions and may guide the future design of HTT-targeting therapies.",
