It supports modern and legacy Microsoft Office files (.docx/.xlsx/.pptx and .doc/.xls/.ppt), PDFs, emails (.eml/.msg/.mbox), OpenDocument formats, HTML, and common plain-text formats \u2014 all through a single, unified API.</p> <p><em>The key point: no LibreOffice, no Java, no shelling out. Just pip install and run. Everything is parsed directly in Python and exposed via generators for memory-efficient processing.</em></p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Developers working with file extractions tasks. Lately these are in particular AI/RAG use-cases.</p> <p>Typical use cases:</p> <p>- RAG / LLM ingestion pipelines</p> <p>- SharePoint or file-share document indexing</p> <p>- Serverless workloads (AWS Lambda, GCP Functions)</p> <p>- Containerized services with tight image size limits</p> <p>- Security-restricted environments where subprocesses are a no-go</p> <p>If you need to reliably extract text and structure from messy, real-world enterprise document collections \u2014 especially ones that still contain decades of legacy Office files \u2014 this is built for you.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most existing solutions rely on external tools:</p> <p>- LibreOffice-based pipelines require large system installs and fragile headless setups.</p> <p>- Apache Tika depends on Java and often runs as a separate service.</p> <p>- Subprocess-based wrappers add operational and security overhead.</p> <p>sharepoint-to-text takes a different approach:</p> <p>- Pure Python, no system dependencies</p> <p>- Works the same locally, in containers, and in serverless environments</p> <p>- One unified interface for all formats (no branching logic per file type)</p> <p>- Native support for legacy Office formats that are common in old SharePoint instances</p> <p>If you want something lightweight, predictable, and easy to embed directly into Python applications \u2014 without standing up extra infrastructure \u2014 that\u2019s the gap this library is trying to fill.</p> <p>Link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text\">https://github.com/Horsmann/sharepoint-to-text</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AsparagusKlutzy1817\"> /u/AsparagusKlutzy1817 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q130ln/sharepointtotext_pure_python_text_extraction_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q130ln/sharepointtotext_pure_python_text_extraction_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to share a library I've been building. GraphQLite turns any SQLite database into a graph database that you can query with Cypher.</p> <p>The API is straightforward\u2014you create a Graph object pointed at a database file, add nodes and edges with properties, then query them using Cypher pattern matching. It also includes built-in graph algorithms like PageRank and Dijkstra if you need them.</p> <p>What I like about this approach is that everything stays in a single file. No server to manage, no configuration to fiddle with. If you're building something that needs relationship modeling but doesn't warrant a full graph database deployment, this might be useful.</p> <p>It also pairs nicely with sqlite-vec if you're building GraphRAG pipelines\u2014you can combine vector similarity search with graph traversals to expand context.</p> <p>`pip install graphqlite`</p> <p>**What My Project Does** - its an sqlite extension that provides the cypher query language, installable and usable as a python library. </p> <p>**Target Audience** - anyone wanting to do work with relational data at smaller scales, learning about knowledge graphs and wishing to avoid dealing with external services.</p> <p>**Comparison** - Neo4j - but no servers needed. </p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite\">https://github.com/colliery-io/graphqlite</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit-Presentation-591\"> /u/Fit-Presentation-591 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q0sgvs/graphqlite_add_graph_database_features_to_sqlite/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q0sgvs/graphqlite_add_graph_database_features_to_sqlite/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN<p>I recently got married, promptly had a bit of a meltdown, and decided to lock myself\nin a room and build for a while.<p>At the same time, I was trying to outbound sell for my startup and kept running into\nthe same problem: I wanted an automation tool that could actually use my computer\nlike a person. Click through UIs, copy/paste between apps, handle messy workflows \u2014\nnot just APIs and webhooks.<p>I couldn\u2019t find anything that felt:\n- consumer-friendly (non-technical)\n- local-first\n- flexible enough for real-world, UI-driven tasks<p>So I challenged myself to see how far I could get building an open-source,\ndesktop automation app powered by AI. That\u2019s Tasker.<p>I\u2019ve been using it daily for ~2\u20133 weeks for sales workflows, and my father has been\nusing it to help generate estimates for his HVAC business. It\u2019s still early (still needs to expand to general OS), but it\u2019s\nalready replaced a lot of manual work for us in browser.<p>One thing that\u2019s become very clear: a cloud/deployable version that can run on cron\nor be triggered via HTTP would unlock a lot of use cases. I\u2019m not totally sure where\nthis goes next, but I wanted to share it early and get feedback.<p>Would love thoughts on:\n- What workflows you\u2019d actually trust something like this with\n- Desktop vs cloud tradeoffs\n- Where this breaks down in practice\n- Whether this feels useful or just scary<p>Repo and docs are linked on the site.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457912\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457912</a></p>\n<p>Points: 11</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",
