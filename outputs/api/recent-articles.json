      "title": "EpiBrain: the brain's epigenetic landscape in a snapshot",
      "content": "Epigenetics connect nature with nurture and can help explain how genes, experiences, and the environment influence gene expression to promote individual differences in behavior and mental health. However, how these perturbations induce epigenetic changes across various regions of the brain remains largely unknown. To visualize changes in brain's epigenetic landscape at a glance, we develop EpiBrain, a method utilizing whole-brain imaging and registration to capture epigenetic changes in the entire zebrafish brain in a snapshot. Using this method, we uncovered brain-wide epigenetic changes induced by brain activity, chemical exposures, and genetic mutations. We found that gadd45b, an immediate early gene with epigenetic modulatory activity, mediates experience-induced epigenetic changes in the brain, and that these changes contribute to brain activity and behavioral alterations. EpiBrain enables rapid and unbiased assessment of whole-brain epigenetic changes following physiological and disease-relevant perturbations and facilitates mechanistic discoveries at the molecular level.",

      "title": "Dyrk1a inhibition with the Novel Compound DYR533: A Cross-Disease Therapeutic Strategy Targeting Amyloidosis, Tau Pathogenesis, and Neuroinflammation",
      "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias are rapidly increasing in prevalence, yet disease-modifying therapies remain largely focused on amyloid-beta with limited efficacy against tau pathology and neuroinflammation, key drivers of neurodegeneration and clinical decline. Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1a (Dyrk1a) phosphorylates tau and amyloid precursor protein and regulates inflammatory signaling, positioning it as a convergence point across pathogenic pathways. We show that brain Dyrk1a protein levels are consistently elevated across ADRDs, replicating findings in AD, confirming prior observations in Picks disease, and demonstrating dysregulation in corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy. We developed DYR533, a selective, orally bioavailable, brain-penetrant Type 1 Dyrk1a kinase inhibitor that also inhibits autophosphorylation and reduces kinase abundance. Across three mouse models (3xTg-AD, PS19, Ts65Dn), DYR533 reduced pathological tau hyperphosphorylation, attenuated neuroinflammation, ameliorated amyloidosis, and improved anxiety-like behavior and spatial memory, collectively supporting Dyrk1a inhibition and DYR533 as a therapeutic strategy for ADRD.",

      "title": "Age dependent impairment of home cage behavior and reactivity in Cntnap2 knock out mouse model",
      "content": "Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is a transmembrane protein that mediates neuron-glia interactions and regulates dendritic spine growth and neuronal migration. Mutations in the CNTNAP2 gene are linked to autism and epilepsy. Younger Cntnap2 KO mice mimic autism phenotypes, while older mice are a model for epilepsy. Thus, comparing behavioral phenotypes across different ages is needed to better understand the age dependent development of disordered brain networks in Cntnap2 mutants. Male and female Cntnap2 KO and WT controls were tested across different age groups (4, 5, 7, 9, and ~11 months) using digging, stimulus (reactivity), and nesting assays. Older Cntnap2 KO mice (7, 9, and ~11 months) showed a significant increase in home cage reactivity (stimulus) assay compared to younger mice at 4 and 5 months of age. Similar trends were observed in male and female Cntnap2 KO mice. No significant differences were observed in WT controls. A significant difference in digging assay was observed in KO female mice between younger (4 month) and older mice post nest removal. An age-dependent significant reduction in nesting behavior was observed in female KO mice; however, no difference was observed in the WT controls. Immunohistochemical analysis showed age dependent change interneuron and microglial network in Cntnap2 KO mice. Our findings suggest disruption in home cage behavior and reactivity in older pre-epileptic Cntnap2 KO mice indicating an age-dependent network alteration and behavior deficits.",

      "content": "Deletion of the SNORD116 non-coding RNA is associated with the development of Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). We and others have identified NHLH2/Nhlh2 as a putative SNORD116/Snord116 target and in this study report that Nhlh2 and Snord116 are co-expressed in forebrain neurons. Nhlh2 mRNA is found predominantly in the nucleus of Snord116+ hypothalamic neurons but is evenly distributed between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in Snord116- neurons. A hypothalamic cell line co-expressing Nhlh2 and Snord116 recapitulates this nuclear partitioning pattern for Nhlh2 only when the putative Snord116 binding site is present in the 3-prime untranslated region of the Nhlh2 mRNA. In a PWS mouse model (Snord116del), Nhlh2 mRNA levels are unchanged in Pomc neurons but are reduced and primarily cytoplasmic in lateral hypothalamic neurons. These findings demonstrate that Snord116 regulates mRNA levels via mRNA partitioning, fundamentally altering our understanding of gene expression networks in PWS.",

      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",
