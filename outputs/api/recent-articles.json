      "title": "Low perioperative hemoglobin as an independent detrimental predictor of functional outcome after basal ganglia hemorrhage: development and validation of a composite prognostic model",
      "content": "BackgroundBasal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) is a life-threatening neurosurgical emergency associated with substantial mortality and disability. Accurate postoperative prognosis assessment remains challenging due to multifactorial influences. Hemoglobin (HB), as the key determinant of oxygen delivery, may play a critical role in neurological recovery, yet the prognostic significance of perioperative HB fluctuations in BGH has not been fully elucidated.MethodsA retrospective cohort of 213 surgically treated BGH patients from 2020 to 2023 was analyzed. Perioperative HB indices, including preoperative (Pre-HB), postoperative (Post-HB), and mean HB (Mean-HB) levels, were evaluated alongside clinical data. Functional outcome at 6 months was determined based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression together with multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to screen for independent risk variables, followed by construction of a composite predictive model. Model discrimination, calibration, and evaluation of the model\u2019s clinical applicability were conducted using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).ResultsPatients with poor prognosis exhibited significantly lower Pre-HB, Post-HB, and Mean-HB levels (all P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed these variables as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The proposed model provides a practical and data-driven tool that demonstrated good predictive performance (AUC = 0.84) in a single-center retrospective cohort. Calibration and DCA demonstrated good consistency and potential clinical applicability.ConclusionPerioperative declines in HB are independently associated with poor postoperative outcomes in BGH. The proposed HB-integrated model provides a reliable, dynamic tool for individualized risk prediction, facilitating precision perioperative management and optimized recovery strategies.",

      "content": "BackgroundMultiple studies have examined bimanual coordination in children with unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) with few in bilateral CP and none utilized electroencephalography (EEG). This study investigates brain activation underlying bimanual performance in individuals with bilateral CP and typical development (TD).MethodsTwenty-six participants (13 CP; 13 TD) completed the Box and Block Test (BBT) and visually cued drumming tasks with each hand (unimanual) and then with both hands synchronously and asynchronously (bimanual). EEG and motion data were recorded during drumming tasks.ResultsChildren with CP demonstrated bilateral impairments in drumming cadence and BBT, increased alpha and beta and decreased gamma EEG band activation in mainly non-dominant brain regions compared to TD. Bimanual tasks tended to show decreased performance and greater alpha and beta band activation than unimanual tasks for both groups. EEG activity and BBT correlations were positive in TD, but negative in CP.DiscussionThis study showed that children with CP had worse motor performance bilaterally and EEG activation differences from TD similar to previous unimanual findings in bilateral CP, however, a more complex bimanual task may have uncovered greater differences.ConclusionEvidence of bimanual deficits and EEG differences reinforces the need for greater research and clinical attention on upper limb function in bilateral CP.",

      "title": "Advances in glaucoma biomechanics from 2000 to 2024: a bibliometric study and visualization analysis",
      "content": "ObjectivesGlaucoma is an irreversible progressive optic neuropathy characterized by neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells. Elevated intraocular pressure induces mechanical stress and strain at the optic nerve head, impairing axonal function and contributing to the onset and progression of glaucoma. This study aims to generalize and visualize the dynamic evolution and research hotspots of glaucoma biomechanics through bibliometric methods.MethodsAll documents about glaucoma biomechanics research in 2000\u20132024 were extracted from two databases (Web of Science Core Collection and PubMed). The hotspots and frontiers of research in terms of remarkable countries, authors, journals, keywords, and cited references were analyzed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer programs.ResultsA collection of 1,655 English articles was included, with a steady increase in annual publications. 4,464 authors from 51 countries/regions were identified, led by the United States. Ethier CR was the most prolific contributor, while Downs JC was the most commonly cited author. Among 203 journals, Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science both led in publications and citations. In the domain of glaucoma biomechanics, keywords \u201clamina cribrosa,\u201d \u201copen angle glaucoma,\u201d and \u201cbiomechanical properties\u201d exhibited the significant centrality. The cited references formed 7 clusters, namely #0 (optic nerve head), #1 (ocular response analyzer), #2 (sclera), #3 (tonometry), #4 (lamina cribrosa), #5 (trabecular meshwork), and #6 (corneal biomechanics).ConclusionOur study employed bibliometric and visualization analyses to state the biomechanical mechanisms underlying intraocular pressure regulation and optic nerve damage, offering the development in the field of glaucoma biomechanics. Future directions may focus on the interdisciplinary applications of artificial intelligence, tissue engineering and novel biomaterials in glaucoma pathogenesis and therapies.",

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "title": "Sylvian fissure angle development on fetal MRI: 22\u201338 gestational weeks",
      "content": "ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to quantify Sylvian fissure angle (SFA) development via fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and establish the reference range and growth curve during normal pregnancy.Materials and methodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study collected 324 singleton fetuses at 22\u201338\u202fweeks of gestation (GA), without abnormal signs on MRI or chromosomal defects, from January 2022 to December 2023. Six SFAs were defined and measured: Sylvian fissure plateau angle (SFPA), Sylvian fissure anterior rotation angle (SFARA), and Sylvian fissure posterior rotation angle (SFPRA) in the transthalamic axial plane, and SFPA, Sylvian fissure superior rotation angle (SFSRA), and Sylvian fissure inferior rotation angle (SFIRA) in the third ventricular coronal plane. Then, the correlation between the SFAs and GA was analyzed, and the growth curve model was used. Retrospective cortical malformation cases validated the model. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate interobserver variability of the SFA measurements.ResultsICC for SFA measurements demonstrated good reliability (0.772\u20130.976). The bilateral SFARA and SFSRA were significantly positively associated with GA (r\u202f=\u202f0.914, 0.926, 0.842, 0.836, left to right, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The bilateral SFPRA, SFIRA, and SFPA (both axial and coronal views) were negatively associated with GA (r value range: \u22120.601 to \u22120.145, all p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For each SFA and GA, the quadratic curve has the best goodness of fit. The model detected cortical malformation (genetically confirmed). Except for the SFARA, all SFAs were statistically different between the two sides.ConclusionThe dynamic development of the fetal SFA can be well evaluated using MRI. The SFA\u2019s reference range will enhance the accuracy of fetal brain assessment and offer a quantitative reference framework for identifying deviations suggestive of cortical malformations.",

      "title": "Rhythm increases perceptual tolerance when measuring electrically evoked compound action potentials in cochlear implant recipients",
      "content": "In cochlear implant (CI) recipients, measurement of the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) is used in clinical routine to prove the electrode-nerve interface and to support fitting, especially in very young children. To record an ECAP amplitude growth function (AGF), electrical stimuli are presented at increasing intensities up to the maximum acceptable loudness (MAL). However, a continuously monotonically rising sound can quickly be perceived as unpleasant and thus impair the success rate of ECAP threshold determination. The present study investigates whether perceptual and objective parameters, which are involved in ECAP measurements, depend on the type of stimulus presentation. In 27 subjects with a CI (28 implants), stimuli of five different AGF patterns were presented ten times in random order at a medial electrode contact, resulting in a total of 50 AGFs per implant. One pattern (Pclin) in which the stimuli increase strictly monotonically is already implemented in the clinical software (MAESTRO). The present study also employed rhythmic patterns and patterns with pauses. The behavioral threshold (THR), the maximum comfortable level (MCL), the MAL, and objective ECAP threshold were analyzed. ECAP threshold values did not change significantly when different stimulus paradigms were applied. Rhythmic AGF patterns were perceived as less unpleasant and enabled a higher MAL compared to Pclin. This in turn led to improved ECAP threshold determination, with the success rate rising to 86.7%, compared to 79.1% for Pclin.",

      "title": "Effects of fatigue on motor unit characteristics in isometric elbow contractions across age groups",
      "content": "This study aims to investigate the neuromuscular regulation mechanisms in different age groups under conditions of fatigue. A total of 50 participants aged between 10 and 80\u202fyears were recruited and divided into 11 different age groups. Each participant performed a triangular wave isometric contraction before and after fatigue. The convolution kernel compensation algorithm was employed to extract the motor unit (MU) spike trains from the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles. The extracted features included root mean square, mean power frequency, motor unit action potential (MUAP) peak-to-peak values, MUAP duration, recruitment threshold, derecruitment threshold, discharge frequency, and common neural drive, which were compared across age groups before and after fatigue. Significant variations in fatigue adaptation were observed among age groups, according to the study. Adults tend to recruit larger motor units to compensate for fatigue-induced strength decline. The elderly group\u2019s discharge frequency and MU recruitment threshold, on the other hand, did not significantly change, indicating that their neuromuscular system was less able to adjust to fatigue. The child group may have relied more on discharge frequency modulation during fatigue because they displayed smaller variations in recruitment threshold. At the same time, PCA results showed that fatigue induced a greater reduction in common-drive coherence in children and older adults, suggesting that maintaining coordinated neural drive becomes more challenging during development and aging. This study clarifies the differences in neuromuscular fatigue adaptation mechanisms at different stages of life and reveals the changing patterns of MU regulation strategies across the examined age range. The resulting age-dependent MU patterns provide an important physiological reference for neurological healthcare, facilitating clearer identification and interpretation of deviations associated with neuromuscular and neurological disorders.",

      "title": "Superoxide dismutase is associated with cerebral small vessel disease burden and vascular mild cognitive impairment in elderly patients",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo examine the associations between superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and the burden of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), as well as vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), in elderly patients.MethodsIn this study, a cohort of 286 elderly individuals was included. Each participant received a comprehensive cognitive assessment. Plasma SOD levels were evaluated. The cumulative CSVD burden was quantified using an ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, based on four key imaging indicators of CSVD: white matter hyperintensity, deep cerebral microbleeds, lacunes, and enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia. To evaluate the associations among SOD levels, CSVD burden, and cognitive function, we employed binary logistic regression analysis, tests for trend, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and mediation analysis.ResultsAfter adjusting for potential confounders, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated levels of SOD were significantly associated with a reduced risk of VaMCI (OR: 0.919; 95% CI: 0.896\u20130.943; P < 0.001) and a lower likelihood of severe CSVD burden (OR: 0.980; 95% CI: 0.968\u20130.992; P = 0.001) in elderly patients. Compared with the lowest quartile of SOD levels, the OR for VaMCI in the highest quartile of SOD levels was 0.039 (95% CI: 0.016\u20130.100; P for trend < 0.001) after adjusting for potential confounders. For severe CSVD burden, the corresponding OR was 0.442 (95% CI: 0.214\u20130.913; P for trend = 0.011). Mediation analysis revealed that the severe CSVD burden significantly moderated the relationship between SOD levels and VaMCI.ConclusionElevated SOD levels serve as a protective factor against severe CSVD burden and VaMCI in elderly patients. A portion of the protective effect of increased SOD on VaMCI may be attributed to its role in mitigating the severity of CSVD.",
