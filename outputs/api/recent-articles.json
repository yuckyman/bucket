      "title": "Leveraging neuroinformatics to understand cognitive phenotypes in elite athletes through systems neuroscience",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

      "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",

      "title": "Large language models can extract metadata for annotation of human neuroimaging publications",
      "content": "We show that recent (mid-to-late 2024) commercial large language models (LLMs) are capable of good quality metadata extraction and annotation with very little work on the part of investigators for several exemplar real-world annotation tasks in the neuroimaging literature. We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized \u201cmicro-benchmarks,\u201d like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe advent of super-resolution microscopy revealed the membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a specialized neuronal cytoskeletal structure composed of actin rings spaced 190 nm apart by two spectrin dimers. While numerous ion channels, cell adhesion molecules, and signaling proteins have been shown to associate with the MPS, tools for accurate and unbiased quantification of their periodic localization remain scarce.MethodsWe developed Napari-WaveBreaker (https://github.com/SamKVs/napari-k2-WaveBreaker), an open-source plugin for the Napari image viewer. The tool quantifies MPS periodicity using autocorrelation and assesses periodic co-distribution between targets using cross-correlation. Performance was evaluated using both simulated datasets and STED microscopy images of periodic and non-periodic axonal proteins.ResultsNapari-WaveBreaker output parameters accurately reflected the visually observed periodicity and detected spatial shifts between two periodic targets. The approach was robust across varying image qualities and reliably distinguished periodic from non-periodic protein distributions.DiscussionNapari-WaveBreaker provides an unbiased, quantitative framework for analyzing MPS-associated periodicity and co-distribution enabling new insights into the molecular organization and modulation of the MPS.",

      "title": "Pragmatic representations of self- and others action in the monkey putamen",
      "content": "Social coordination in primates relies on parieto-frontal networks encoding self- and others actions. These areas send convergent projections to the putamen, but its role in representing self- and others actions remains unknown. We recorded neuronal activity from anatomically characterized putamen regions during a Mutual Action Task (MAT), where a monkey and a human took turns grasping a multi-affordance object based on sensory cues. Cortico-striatal synaptic input, indexed by local field potentials, mirrored known cortical dynamics during sensory instructions and movement, while single neurons selectively encoded the monkey s action, the human s action, or both. Grip type was encoded only during the monkey s trials. Viewing the partner s action was neither necessary nor sufficient: neurons fired even when the partner s action occurred in darkness, but not when viewed through a transparent barrier. These findings support a pragmatic role for the putamen in gating cortical representations of self- and other s actions in social contexts",

      "title": "Comparison of T1- and T2-weighted MRI contrasts of ex vivo ex situ brains fixed with solutions used in gross anatomy laboratories",
      "content": "Post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers high resolution and histological correlation, so protocols have been developed by brain banks using hemispheres fixed by immersion in Neutral-buffered formalin (NBF), but they provide limited tissue samples. Conversely, anatomy laboratories could supply complete brains perfused either with a salt-saturated (SSS) or an alcohol-formaldehyde (AFS) solution. These fixation methods alter the brain's molecular properties, potentially affecting MRI quality and structural characteristics. T1- and T2-weighted (T1w, T2w) contrasts change with NBF fixation, but the effects of SSS or AFS remain unknown. We compared T1w and T2w intensities of different regions of interest (ROIs), including subcortical white matter (WM), cortical and deep gray matter (GM), in brains fixed with NBF, SSS and AFS. We scanned 20 ex situ hemispheres (NBF-immersed=7; SSS-perfused=7; AFS-perfused=6) in a 3T MRI scanner using T1w (0.7mm3) and T2w (0.64mm3) sequences overnight. Mean intensities of 29 ROIs in T1w and T2w MRIs and GM-WM ratios were calculated and compared in brains fixed with the three solutions. We found that T1w images were more affected by the fixation process, inverting the contrast of in vivo T1w and reducing the GM-WM contrast in AFS-fixed brains. T2w images resembled in vivo scans and maintained a sharp contrast in brains fixed with the three solutions, although the GM-WM intensity ratios were lowered in SSS-fixed brains. In conclusion, brains fixed with SSS and AFS from anatomy laboratories could be used for MRI studies, especially with the T2w sequence that seems more appropriate for structural analyses in different ROIs.",

      "title": "Functional MRI signals as fast as 1Hz are coupled to brain states and predict spontaneous neural activity",
      "content": "fMRI signals were traditionally seen as slow and sampled in the order of seconds, but recent technological advances have enabled much faster sampling rates. We hypothesized that high-frequency fMRI signals can capture spontaneous neural activity that index brain states. Using fast fMRI (TR=378ms) and simultaneous EEG in 27 humans drifting between sleep and wakefulness, we found that fMRI spectral power increased during NREM sleep (compared to wakefulness) across several frequency ranges as fast as 1Hz. This fast fMRI power was correlated with canonical arousal-linked EEG rhythms (alpha and delta), with spatiotemporal correlation patterns for each rhythm reflecting a combination of shared arousal dynamics and rhythm-specific neural signatures. Using machine learning, we found that alpha and delta EEG rhythms can be decoded from fast fMRI signals, in subjects held-out from the training set, showing that fMRI as fast as 0.9Hz (alpha) and 0.7Hz (delta) contains reliable neurally-coupled information that generalizes across individuals. Finally, we demonstrate that this fast fMRI acquisition allows for EEG rhythms to be decoded from 3.8s windows of fMRI data. These results reveal that high-frequency fMRI signals are coupled to dynamically varying brain states, and that fast fMRI sampling allows for more temporally precise quantification of spontaneous neural activity than previously thought possible.",

      "title": "HIF1\u03b1-dependent induction of the T-Type calcium channel CaV3.2 mediates hypoxia-induced neuronal hyperexcitability",
      "content": "Post-stroke epilepsy (PSE) is a major cause of acquired epilepsy in adults, yet the molecular mechanisms linking post-ischemic hypoxia to neuronal hyperexcitability remain poorly understood. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a central mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia and may contribute to epileptogenesis by regulating ion channel expression. Here, we identify the T-type calcium channel CaV3.2 (encoded by Cacna1h) as a direct transcriptional target of HIF1 and demonstrate its role in hypoxia-induced network hyperexcitability. Using neuronal cell lines, primary cortical neurons, and organotypic brain slice cultures (OTCs) from mouse and human tissue, we show that HIF1 activation, either through hypoxia or HIF1 overexpression, consistently increases Cacna1h expression. In NS20Y cells, overexpression of a normoxia-stable HIF1 variant increased Cacna1h promoter activity in both fluorescent and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The same effect was observed in primary cortical neurons, where HIF1 overexpression also elevated network activity measured by multielectrode array recordings. In murine and human OTCs, hypoxia led to marked increase of HIF1 and Cacna1h expression at both transcript and protein levels. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced a persistent increase in neuronal firing rate, which was recapitulated by HIF1 overexpression alone. Together, these results establish HIF1 as a key transcriptional regulator of CaV3.2 in neurons and reveal a conserved hypoxia-HIF1-CaV3.2 pathway that enhances neuronal excitability. This mechanism may underlie hypoxia-induced network hyperactivity and contribute to the pathogenesis of post-ischemic epileptogenesis.",

      "title": "Dynamic electrocortical states and paradoxical complexity during desflurane anesthesia",
      "content": "Background: How general anesthesia alters the dynamics of electrocortical activity is crucial to understand the neural mechanisms of unconsciousness. Local cortical activity undergoes spontaneous transitions at constant anesthetic concentration. The spatial organization and temporal dynamics of state transitions in large-scale electrocortical activity is incompletely understood. Methods: Epidural electrocorticogram was recorded from the right hemisphere in 8 rats (14 experiments) using chronically implanted 32-channel flexible electrode arrays during desflurane anesthesia at 6%, 4%, 2%, 0% inhaled concentrations, each maintained for 1 hour. Cortical states were identified by principal component analysis of power spectrograms followed by density-based clustering simultaneously across all anesthetic conditions. State-specific spatiotemporal complexity was quantified by the normalized Lempel-Ziv algorithm to capture signal variability beyond spectral effects. Temporal dynamics were assessed by state occurrence, dwell times, and transition probabilities. Results: Seven cortical states were identified. Six states generally tracked anesthetic depth with an increase in delta power and decrease in complexity, but their occurrence was not tied to any anesthetic level (p<0.001). The 7th state was a paradoxical, activated state that mostly occurred during deep anesthesia and was marked by reduced delta (p<0.001) and elevated complexity (p<0.001). Cortical activity was more likely to remain in a given state than to switch (mean dwell time of 136.55 s, persistence likelihood of 99.36%). When transitions occurred, they followed structured, non-random dynamics, primarily within light- or deep-anesthesia states (FDR-corrected p<0.05), with a mild tendency to exit deep states and enter light states (p=0.0039), consistent with anesthetic emergence. Conclusions: Electrocortical activity is not a unitary function of anesthetic concentration but involves spontaneous dynamics and paradoxically activated states with increased global complexity during deep anesthesia. The results suggest ongoing spontaneous reorganization of cortical activity during prolonged anesthetic challenge and provide new insight into anesthesia-induced brain dynamics that may inform future strategies for monitoring and manipulating the state of consciousness and facilitating recovery from general anesthesia.",
