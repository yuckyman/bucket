      "title": "Aging redirects prior expectations from perception to action",
      "content": "Aging profoundly reshapes how the brain integrates sensory evidence with prior expectations during perceptual decision-making. Combining behavioural modelling with high-density EEG, we show that older adults assign greater weight on prior information, resulting in stronger decisional bias and reduced sensory precision under probabilistic cues. Neural dynamics revealed a breakdown of anticipatory tuning in visual alpha rhythms, supporting sensory preparation in youth, alongside enhanced central beta activity, indicating a shift toward pre-emptive motor engagement aligned with expected responses. A data-driven decomposition further showed that, whereas prior-driven behaviour in younger adults emerges from a flexible interplay between sensory and executive oscillatory systems, it becomes dominated in aging by a rigid, response-centred mode. Together, these findings uncover a large-scale reconfiguration of predictive computations with age, marking a transition from adaptive sensory-executive coordination to a more automatized, action-oriented predictive strategy.",

      "title": "MEG correlates of empty subjects in Japanese control and raising constructions",
      "content": "Empty categories are unpronounced elements with syntactic properties that play a central role in theories of sentence structure. Although there are several types within these categories, the neural basis for distinguishing among them remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigate whether the brain distinguishes between two Japanese sentence structures: Control and raising. Although these constructions appear similar on the surface, they are argued to involve different types of empty categories. In theoretical analyses, the control-type empty category, which is called PRO, is often treated as an anaphoric element, similar to reflexives such as himself and herself, whereas the raising-type empty category is a noun phrase trace. Twenty-six native Japanese speakers participated in a reading task under three experimental conditions: Control, raising, and baseline. Source estimates were computed, and condition differences were tested using spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation t-tests. We observed late left-hemispheric differences at approximately 700-800 ms after the critical verb. The control condition elicited larger responses than the raising condition, with activity centered in the temporal cortex spanning the middle temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus and extending into the anterior insula and the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, the control condition elicited larger late responses than the baseline condition in a broader left fronto-temporal distribution, including the inferior frontal cortex, the anterior temporal cortex, and the insula. These results provide source-level evidence that brain activity in the left language network differs between the control and raising conditions in Japanese during online sentence comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that we can distinguish empty category types in the brain.",

      "title": "A robust low-dimensional manifold organizes neuronal responses to sustained input",
      "content": "Understanding how neurons transform synaptic input into spiking output remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Although neuronal responses are often described in hig-dimensional terms, it remains unclear to what extent neuronal input-output transformations are governed by lower-dimensional structure. Here, we examine the geometric organization of neuronal input-output relationships using intracellular current-clamp recordings from mouse visual cortex. By representing neuronal responses in a feature space capturing multiple aspects of spike timing and excitability, we analyze how response variability is distributed across dimensions. We find that neuronal responses are organized within a robust low-dimensional manifold that accounts for the majority of observed variance and emerges despite substantial heterogeneity in neuronal responses and stimulation conditions, indicating a general organizational constraint rather than idiosyncratic properties of individual neurons. Importantly, the identified low-dimensional manifold is not a trivial consequence of feature reduction but delineates a constrained response space within which neuronal input-output transformations are expressed. Together, these results reveal a previously underappreciated regularity in neuronal response organization and delineate geometric constraints shaping neuronal input-output mappings under sustained drive, providing a principled foundation for computational models of neuronal function.",

      "content": "Mutations in genes encoding a range of ion-conducting proteins disrupt development of the cerebral cortex in humans, often causing polymicrogyria (PMG), yet how ion conduction guides the development of cortical architecture is not clear. Here, we describe three individuals with brain malformations including PMG and microcephaly in whom de novo, missense mutations were identified in PANX1--encoding an ATP and ion conducting channel. We show that these PMG-associated PANX1 mutations (p.D14H, p.M37R, and p.N338T) disrupt normal glycosylation and confer gain-of-function with respect to ATP release and channel conductance. In vivo modeling of PANX1 mutant forms in cortical progenitor cells demonstrated disrupted cell migration and cell fate, including excess cell death in both mice and ferret models. Modeling the N338T allele in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons further revealed how conductance changes lead to functional consequences of increased excitability and synchronicity. Our results show that normal PANX1 function contributes to cortical structure through regulation of ion conductance and ATP release and provides insight into how these processes influence corticogenesis and cytoarchitecture more broadly.",

      "title": "Formation, stability, and competition in dendritic proto-spines",
      "content": "Over 80 % of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain terminate on dendritic spines, which support key functions of memory storage and computation. Despite the neurodevelopmental and computational implications of spine formation, little is known about the interplay of physical and chemical signaling mechanisms that govern spine initiation. We developed a physics-based model for the formation, stability, and placement of membrane protrusions (proto-spines) triggered by membrane-bending proteins such as IRSp53, and activated by neurotransmitter inputs. We identify two distinct proto-spine energy manifolds depending on the concentration of activated IRSp53, causing shallow and sharp geometries respectively. The sharp proto-spines exhibit properties of wave-pinning models, including stimulus-local formation, positional stability, and merging, but unlike the wave-pinning model they also exhibit competition. We linked the physics-based model to a mass-action chemistry model of neurotransmitter-driven signaling pathway activation of IRSp53 to simulate proto-spine formation in response to neurotransmitter stimulus patterns. Multiple proto-spines compete for IRSp53, leading to inter-spine spacing of 1 - 3 m, similar to experiments. Correlated and spatially clustered synaptic input enhances proto-spine lifetime and density compared to non-correlated stimuli. Finally, we tested the effects of autism spectrum disorder-related mutations in spine-formation signaling, leading to altered RhoGEF activity. We found that elevated RhoGEF activity increased proto-spine density and reduced their lifetime, consistent with ASD phenotypes. Overall, our analysis shows that the interplay between membrane bending mechanics and reaction-diffusion chemistry creates rich proto-spine dynamics and concisely captures key features of early spine formation.",

It embeds your Python app as a ZIP inside a Go-based SFX installer. You can choose console or GUI modes, optionally create a desktop shortcut, include user data that won\u2019t be overwritten on updates, and the SFX extracts only once for faster startup.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br /> This project is meant for Python developers who distribute PyInstaller applications and need a portable, fast, and updatable installer solution. It works for both small scripts and production-ready Python apps.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> Unlike simply shipping a PyInstaller executable, q2sfx allows easy creation of self-extracting installers with optional desktop shortcuts, persistent user data, and faster startup since extraction happens only on first run or update. This gives more control and a professional distribution experience without extra packaging tools.</p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <ul> <li>PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/q2sfx/\">https://pypi.org/project/q2sfx/</a></li> <li>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/AndreiPuchko/q2sfx\">https://github.com/AndreiPuchko/q2sfx</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/a8691\"> /u/a8691 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q85pue/q2sfx_create_selfextracting_executables_from/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q85pue/q2sfx_create_selfextracting_executables_from/\">[comments]</a></span>",
