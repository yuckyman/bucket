      "title": "Sleep-like slow waves in wakefulness index post-stroke behavioural alterations",
      "content": "Increases in high-amplitude, low-frequency EEG oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep serve as markers of neuronal silencing, which disrupts functional connectivity and is associated with a loss of awareness and responsiveness. Cortical slowing likewise occurs during wakefulness, upon sleep deprivation, and accompanies performance deterioration. Recent work has revealed similar oscillations (termed 'sleep-like slow waves') following stroke in brain regions close or connected to a brain lesion, offering a plausible but untested mechanism for stroke-related behavioural impairment. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and behavioural performance while 30 unilateral stroke patients (12 left hemisphere, 18 right hemisphere) and 27 age-matched healthy adults completed a computerised perceptual decision-making task. Sleep-like slow waves occurred more frequently in stroke patients relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between slow wave occurrence and the accuracy and speed of perceptual reports in stroke patients, suggesting that variations in the occurrence of slow waves may contribute to cognitive heterogeneity post-stroke. Evidence that sleep-like slow waves predict deficits in perceptual decision-making following stroke indicates that stroke-induced lesions can destabilize cortical networks extending beyond the damaged regions, thereby contributing to broader cognitive impairments.",

      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",
