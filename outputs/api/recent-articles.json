      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I learned python programming recently and built my first python app named TidyBit. It is a simple and easy to use file organizer app. I learned many new things while building the app. </p> <p>What My Project Does:</p> <p>My project is a simple file organizer app, that is useful for anyone who wants to organize cluttered files in folders that are piled up with time. Folders such as Downloads, Desktop, Documents, Videos, Music, folders in an external drive or secondary hard drive..etc. </p> <p>Target Audience: </p> <p>TidyBit is a small python app but not an experimental one or built just for fun. When i started to work on my first app, i wanted to build a small and truly useful app. I wanted to build a simple app with graphical user interface and that can be used by everyone.</p> <p>Comparison: </p> <p>There are many similar python projects on GitHub to organize files. Most of them don't have a graphical user interface. Need knowledge on how to run those programs. TidyBit is easy to use. It works on Windows and Linux platforms. The app is available to download as installable file for windows and portable AppImage format for Linux. For Linux AppImage, it may be necessary to install the correct version of FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) to run the app.</p> <p>More information on the app:</p> <p>For initial version, I used python's custom tkinter library for GUI. That didn't look good on Linux ditros. On Windows, the GUI looks modern but it is not the same on Linux. This GUI inconsistency and some more improvements were made to the app. Improvements such as Progress Bar in the UI to display real time progress. Duplicate filename handling, better file organization logic. thread separation for UI and logic so that UI won't crash if the app is used on large sized files. </p> <p>The latest version of the app is TidyBit version 1.2. It is now better, the UI looks good and consistent across Linux and Windows platforms. The operating system theme won't change the look of the UI. </p> <p>Please check the app by visiting the TidyBit app repository as mentioned below. Any feedback on the app or any other suggestions are welcome. Thank you.</p> <p>GitHub repository link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Veda-Swaroop/TidyBit\">TidyBit GitHub Repo</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swaroop_34\"> /u/swaroop_34 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfo7r8/i_developed_my_first_python_app_tidybit_a_simple/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfo7r8/i_developed_my_first_python_app_tidybit_a_simple/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>AcquireMock is a self-hosted payment processor for testing and development. It simulates a real payment gateway with:</p> <ul> <li>Payment page generation with card forms (accepts test card 4444 4444 4444 4444)</li> <li>OTP email verification flow</li> <li>Webhook delivery with HMAC signatures and retry logic</li> <li>Saved payment methods for returning customers</li> <li>Production-ready features: CSRF protection, rate limiting, request validation</li> </ul> <p>Tech stack: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + Pydantic. Frontend is vanilla JS to keep it lightweight.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is meant for:</p> <ul> <li>Developers building payment integrations who hit Stripe test mode limits</li> <li>Teaching/learning how payment flows work (OTP, webhooks, 3DS simulation)</li> <li>Offline development environments where external APIs aren't accessible</li> <li>Projects that need a mock payment system without external dependencies</li> </ul> <p>Not intended for production use - it's a testing/development tool.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike Stripe's official test mode:</p> <ul> <li>Runs completely offline (no API keys, no internet required)</li> <li>No rate limits or request caps</li> <li>Full control over webhook timing and retry logic</li> <li>Can be customized for specific testing scenarios</li> <li>Works without any external service configuration</li> </ul> <p>Compared to other mock payment tools, this one includes a full UI (not just API endpoints), supports multi-language, has email OTP flow, and comes with Docker Compose for instant setup.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/illusiOxd/acquiremock\">https://github.com/illusiOxd/acquiremock</a></p> <p>Open to feedback, especially on the webhook retry implementation - curious if there's a better approach.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/illusiON_MLG1337\"> /u/illusiON_MLG1337 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfl8ln/built_an_opensource_mock_payment_gateway_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pfl8ln/built_an_opensource_mock_payment_gateway_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
