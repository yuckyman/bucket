      "title": "Sleep controls peroxisomal abundance to reduce wake-induced brain oxidation",
      "content": "Sleep is increasingly linked to the regulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and lipid metabolism. However, the mechanisms underlying this interaction are underexplored. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to report a bidirectional relationship between sleep and peroxisomes, cellular organelles that process lipids and alleviate ROS. Of the genes that change expression after sleep deprivation in the dorsal fan-shaped body, knockdown of the peroxisomal biogenesis factor Pex16 results in decreased sleep. Pex16 acts in several brain regions to modulate sleep amount, with ellipsoid body neurons (EB) producing the highest sleep reduction of the sleep-promoting regions. Consistent with a general role for peroxisomes, knockdown of other peroxisomal enzymes relevant for lipid import and synthesis also decreases sleep. Whole-brain peroxisomal numbers increase with wake, which is supported by lipidomic analysis indicating that peroxisomal-derived phospholipids are the major contributors to phospholipid changes after wake or sleep deprivation. Peroxisomal proliferation in the EB is driven by neuronal activity and increased oxidation, suggesting that these mediate the effect of wake/sleep loss. In turn, peroxisomes alleviate the oxidation accumulated during wake, such that loss of Pex16 in the EB works non-cell autonomously to increase lipid peroxidation brain-wide. This likely contributes to sleep loss, as sleep is rescued with an antioxidant. Together, these results position peroxisomes as key players in sleep, regulating ROS and thereby maintaining normal cycles.",

      "title": "Effect of dependency and tail behavior on a probability inequality occurring in modeling cognitive processes",
      "content": "A central idea in modeling performance in cognitive tasks is dynamic competition among processes in separate channels, known as \"race model\". This model implies a certain inequality between associated probability distributions under rather general conditions. The inequality represents an important empirical test of the race model, but its usefulness is limited since it requires the assumption of stochastic independence between the channels. Using the stop signal paradigm as reference, we investigate more general forms of stochastic dependence that still imply the inequality using the concepts of copula and heavy-tailed marginal distributions.",

      "title": "CB2 cannabinoid receptor-specific therapeutic antibody agonists for treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy",
      "content": "Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a debilitating complication of cancer treatment. CB2 cannabinoid receptor activation reduces inflammation and is an attractive therapeutic target. Antibodies targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), like CB2, offer high specificity and peripheral-restriction, thereby minimizing off-target activity. Here, we investigated the efficacy of first-in-class CB2-specific antibody agonists (AB110 and AB120) and an isotype control (AB100) on mechanical and cold hypersensitivity induced by paclitaxel in both tumor-free and mammary (4T1) tumor-bearing female mice. These CB2 antibody agonists exhibit biased G-alfa; signaling and also reduce macrophage markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Paclitaxel produced behavioral hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation, which were reduced by AB110 and AB120 for approximately 48 hours post-injection in female mice. Repeated daily dosing did not lead to tolerance to the anti-allodynic effects. Prophylactic treatment with AB110 and AB120 during paclitaxel treatment delayed, but did not prevent, the development of paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivities after termination of dosing with antibody agonists. AB100 had no effect under any conditions. The anti-allodynic effects of AB120 were absent in CB2 knockout mice, confirming pharmacological specificity via CB2 receptors. Furthermore, AB120 remained effective in paclitaxel-treated tumor-bearing mice. Neither AB110 nor AB120 affected locomotor activity in otherwise naive mice. The cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel on 4T1 tumor cell line was maintained in the presence of CB2 antibody agonists in vitro. Overall, our results suggest that CB2-specific antibody agonists are promising candidates for treating CIPN, providing lasting pain relief without tolerance, off target effects or unwanted CB1-mediated motor side effects.",

      "title": "A computational model of the mammalian auditory periphery with a multichannel, energy-driven, medial olivocochlear reflex",
      "content": "The afferent auditory system, and how its specialized mechanisms and circuits support ecologically relevant auditory computations such as speech recognition, has received considerable attention in decades past. This work has culminated in accurate computational models of early afferent coding alongside a good understanding of how low-level mechanisms (e.g., peripheral tuning) impact auditory perception. In contrast, the auditory efferent system and its role in auditory perception is much less well understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we describe modifications to a model of the auditory periphery to include a medial olivocochlear efferent pathway that dynamically adjusts cochlear gain in response to sound via the classical medial olivocochlear reflex loop. We show that this model can simulate the effects of contralateral elicitors on auditory-nerve responses, including the effect of elicitors that are tonotopically distant from probes. Inclusion of across-frequency efferent effects necessitated a novel multichannel design.",
