      "content": "IntroductionStandardized treadmill-based balance disturbances have potential to improve assessments of dynamic balance control in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here we examined the validity of a step threshold task to measure dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThirty-nine participants with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease underwent clinical testing and performed a dynamic balance assessment both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. For the assessment, participants were instructed to avoid stepping in response to progressively larger postural perturbations applied via treadmill translations. The step threshold was defined as the perturbation magnitude that resulted in a stepping response on four consecutive trials. Validity was assessed by correlating medication-mediated changes in gold standard clinical measures and medication-mediated changes in stepping.ResultsMedication-mediated changes in step threshold correlated with changes in MDS-UPDRS part III (p < 0.01), with change in MDS-UPDRS 3.12 postural instability (p < 0.05), and with measures of executive function: CPT-3 Omission T-score (p = 0.013), the CPT-3 Commission T-score (p = 0.019), and the CPT-3 Variability T-score (p = 0.040).DiscussionOur results validate step threshold task as a measure of dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Correlations with gold standard assessments of motor and executive function suggest that the step threshold task can serve as a comprehensive measure of dynamic balance control.",

      "title": "The effects of aquatic and land-based interventions on children with developmental coordination disorder",
      "content": "BackgroundKnowledge about the effects of aquatic intervention on children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), as well as the maintenance of these effects over time, is still scarce. We believe that there is a need to advance our knowledge of this subject, for which we have set ourselves the following objectives: (1) to test whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions influence the motor performance of children with DCD; (2) to check whether these effects persist over time; and (3) whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions bring motor performance values closer together between children with DCD and those with typical development.Methods76 children aged between 6 and 10 years old were divided into four groups, control developmental coordination disorder (C-DCD); control typical development (C-TD); experimental terrestrial developmental coordination disorder (T-DCD); and experimental aquatic developmental coordination disorder (A-DCD). Due to some dropouts, the final sample consisted of 66 children, 27 girls and 39 boys. The groups of children with DCD were randomized according to their initial total score on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Test - second edition (MABC-2). The analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) carried out in the pre-test showed similarity between the means of the DCD groups (C-DCD, T-DCD and A-DCD), which ensured that these groups started from the same performance level. The interventions lasted 4.5 months (18 weeks) with three sessions a week, totaling 54 sessions of 60 min each. The experimental groups took part in the same intervention protocol, with the only difference being the environment (A-DCD = aquatic environment; T-DCD = terrestrial environment).ResultsAnalysis of the results revealed no significant effect for the group and time point interaction, F(6, 133) = 1.36, p = 0.235. However, effects were detected for group, F(2, 54.7) = 3.78, p < 0.05, and for time point F(3, 131) = 22.91, p < 0.001. The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test found a difference between the T-DCD and C-DCD groups (p < 0.05; independent-groups effect size (dig = 0.85; dig = 0.87; dig = 0.92). For time point, differences were found between the pre-test and the other time points [post-intervention (repeated measures effect size) (dR,M = 1.14), 3 months post-test (dR,M = 1.51) and 6 months post-test (dR,M = 2.2)] with a significance level of p < 0.001. For the A-DCD group there was no statistically significant difference in relation to either the C-DCD or T-DCD group, but we did observe large effect size values [pre-test and post-test (dR,M = 1.14), pre-test and 3 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.29) and pre-test and 6 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.61)]. Regarding the analysis of the Z score, the results indicated an interaction effect for the group and time point F(6, 132) = 2.30, p = 0.038. This difference was located by post hoc between the C-DCD group and the A-DCD (p < 0.05; independent groups pre-test - post-test effect size (digpp = 1.72) and dig = 0.79) and T-DCD (p < 0.05 ES digpp = 1.65 and dig = 0.79) groups at 6 months-post-test.ConclusionWe conclude that both aquatic and terrestrial interventions have positive effects on the motor performance of children with DCD, that these effects are maintained over time but also bring the motor performance of children with DCD closer to that of children with typical development.",

      "title": "New gait performance indices and cognitive functions: a pilot study on correlation in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and involves impairment of both motor and cognitive functions, significantly affecting the quality of walking and consequently the quality of life of people affected by this disease. This study analyzed the relationship between gait alterations and cognitive deterioration, using validated clinical tests and an innovative indicator, the \u03c6-bonacci gait number, which quantifies gait harmonicity, symmetry, and consistency. Kinematic data collected during the 6-Minute Walk test on 19 people with PD (pwPD) and 15 healthy adults were analyzed. The results highlighted a significant negative correlation between gait harmonicity and cognitive performance (\u03c6-bonacci gait number\u2014Time Up and Go Dual Task; r\u202f=\u202f0.797, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Finally, mediation analysis showed that global cognitive function (MoCA) indirectly influences gait harmonicity through TUG-DT. The results suggest that gait in pwPD is strongly modulated by executive-attentional functions, supporting its cognitive modulation rather than a purely automatic nature. This study allowed to explore the complex relationship between cognitive functions and the motor system, deepening how these interactions influence and refine motor behavior. Therefore, rehabilitation programs combining motor exercises and cognitive training could be more effective in improving gait quality, reducing the risk of falls, and improving person\u2019s quality of life.",

      "content": "IntroductionCognitive impairment is a prevalent nonmotor symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), significantly affecting patients\u2019 quality of life. Considering the gap in understanding the relationship between cognitive impairments in Parkinson\u2019s disease and executive function, this study aimed to investigate the association between three cognitive statutes: normal cognition condition (PD-NCC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and mild dementia (PDD), and the performance of the Anterior Attentional System in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 96 participants with Parkinson\u2019s disease (45 with PD-NCC, 39 with PD-MCI, and 12 with PDD) and 46 participants from control group, recruited between 2020 and 2023. MDS-UPDRS was used during the neurological examination. To assess cognitive status, we used: Mini-Mental State Examination, Californian Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (A and B form). The ROtman Baycrest Battery was employed to evaluate the Anterior Attentional System.ResultsParticipants with PDD exhibited significant impairments in the Anterior Attentional System. Energization impairment was observed in PD-MCI and PDD, though mildly. Monitoring and task-setting processes were notably impaired only in individuals with PDD, while these functions remained intact in those with PD-NCC and PD-MCI.ConclusionThe Anterior Attentional System is well-preserved in PD-NCC and PD-MCI however notably disturbed in PDD.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "From Play to Detection: Mini-SPACE as a Serious Game for Unsupervised Cognitive Impairment Screening",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.12068v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Early detection of Cognitive Impairment (CI) is critical for timely intervention, preservation of independence, and reducing the burden of dementia. Yet, most screening tools remain lengthy, clinic-based, and poorly suited for large-scale unsupervised deployment. This paper evaluates the test-retest reliability, validity, and usability of mini-SPACE, a short iPad-based serious game for detecting early signs of CI. Participants played mini-SPACE at home without supervision once a week for three weeks, with a longer version of the game in the final week. Mini-SPACE showed good test-retest reliability in unsupervised settings. While younger age was the primary predictor of performance, usability, and cognitive load, participants of all ages were able to complete the tasks and reported good usability and low cognitive load. Importantly, the prediction of scores in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved with repeated measures. These findings highlight mini-SPACE as a promising digital marker for scalable, age-sensitive screening and potential longitudinal tracking of CI.",

A custom cylindrical tangible proxy leverages affordances of physical knobs and tabletop support for stable input. We evaluate both modalities across isolated tasks (2DoF translation, 1DoF rotation scaling), semicombined (3DoF translation rotation), and full 4DoF compound manipulation.\n  We offer analyses of hand interactions, tangible interactions, and their comparison in MR tasks. For hand interactions, compound tasks required repetitive corrections, increasing completion times yet surprisingly, rotation errors were smaller in compound tasks than in rotation only tasks. Tangible interactions exhibited significantly larger errors in translation, rotation, and scaling during compound tasks compared to isolated tasks. Crucially, tangible interactions outperformed hand interactions in precision, likely due to tabletop support and constrained 4DoF design. These findings inform designers opting for hand-only interaction (highlighting tradeoffs in compound tasks) and those leveraging tangibles (emphasizing precision gains despite compound-task challenges).",

      "title": "\"Power of Words\": Stealthy and Adaptive Private Information Elicitation via LLM Communication Strategies",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.11961v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While communication strategies of Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for human-LLM interactions, they can also be weaponized to elicit private information, yet such stealthy attacks remain under-explored. This paper introduces the first adaptive attack framework for stealthy and targeted private information elicitation via communication strategies. Our framework operates in a dynamic closed-loop: it first performs real-time psychological profiling of the users' state, then adaptively selects an optimized communication strategy, and finally maintains stealthiness through prompt-based rewriting. We validated this framework through a user study (N=84), demonstrating its generalizability across 3 distinct LLMs and 3 scenarios. The targeted attacks achieved a 205.4% increase in eliciting specific targeted information compared to stealthy interactions without strategies. Even stealthy interactions without specific strategies successfully elicited private information in 54.8% cases. Notably, users not only failed to detect the manipulation but paradoxically rated the attacking chatbot as more empathetic and trustworthy. Finally, we advocate for mitigations, encouraging developers to integrate adaptive, just-in-time alerts, users to build literacy against specific manipulative tactics, and regulators to define clear ethical boundaries distinguishing benign persuasion from coercion.",

      "title": "Enhancing XR Auditory Realism via Multimodal Scene-Aware Acoustic Rendering",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.11930v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In Extended Reality (XR), rendering sound that accurately simulates real-world acoustics is pivotal in creating lifelike and believable virtual experiences. However, existing XR spatial audio rendering methods often struggle with real-time adaptation to diverse physical scenes, causing a sensory mismatch between visual and auditory cues that disrupts user immersion. To address this, we introduce SAMOSA, a novel on-device system that renders spatially accurate sound by dynamically adapting to its physical environment. SAMOSA leverages a synergistic multimodal scene representation by fusing real-time estimations of room geometry, surface materials, and semantic-driven acoustic context. This rich representation then enables efficient acoustic calibration via scene priors, allowing the system to synthesize a highly realistic Room Impulse Response (RIR). We validate our system through technical evaluation using acoustic metrics for RIR synthesis across various room configurations and sound types, alongside an expert evaluation (N=12). Evaluation results demonstrate SAMOSA's feasibility and efficacy in enhancing XR auditory realism.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.11823v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: CollaClassroom is an AI-enhanced platform that embeds large language models (LLMs) into both individual and group study panels to support real-time collaboration. We evaluate CollaClassroom with Bangladeshi university students (N = 12) through a small-group study session and a pre-post survey. Participants have substantial prior experience with collaborative learning and LLMs and express strong receptivity to LLM-assisted study (92% agree/strongly agree). Usability ratings are positive, including high learnability(67% \"easy\"), strong reliability (83% \"reliable\"), and low frustration (83% \"not at all\"). Correlational analyses show that participants who perceive the LLM as supporting equal participation also view it as a meaningful contributor to discussions (r = 0.86). Moreover, their pre-use expectations of LLM value align with post-use assessments (r = 0.61). These findings suggest that LLMs can enhance engagement and perceived learning when designed to promote equitable turn-taking and transparency across individual and shared spaces. The paper contributes an empirically grounded account of AI-mediated collaboration in a Global South higher-education context, with design implications for fairness-aware orchestration of human-AI teamwork.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.11811v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many promising applications of multimodal wearables require continuous sensing and heavy computation, yet users reject such devices due to privacy concerns. This paper shares our experiences building an ear-mounted voice-and-vision wearable that performs local AI inference using a paired smartphone as a trusted personal edge. We describe the hardware--software co-design of this privacy-preserving system, including challenges in integrating a camera, microphone, and speaker within a 30-gram form factor, enabling wake word-triggered capture, and running quantized vision-language and large-language models entirely offline. Through iterative prototyping, we identify key design hurdles in power budgeting, connectivity, latency, and social acceptability. Our initial evaluation shows that fully local multimodal inference is feasible on commodity mobile hardware with interactive latency. We conclude with design lessons for researchers developing embedded AI systems that balance privacy, responsiveness, and usability in everyday settings.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.11587v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.",

      "title": "Social and Physical Attributes-Defined Trust Evaluation for Effective Collaborator Selection in Human-Device Coexistence Systems",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.11578v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In human-device coexistence systems, collaborations among devices are determined by not only physical attributes such as network topology but also social attributes among human users. Consequently, trust evaluation of potential collaborators based on these multifaceted attributes becomes critical for ensuring the eventual outcome. However, due to the high heterogeneity and complexity of physical and social attributes, efficiently integrating them for accurate trust evaluation remains challenging. To overcome this difficulty, a canonical correlation analysis-enhanced hypergraph self-supervised learning (HSLCCA) method is proposed in this research. First, by treating all attributes as relationships among connected devices, a relationship hypergraph is constructed to comprehensively capture inter-device relationships across three dimensions: spatial attribute-related, device attribute-related, and social attribute-related. Next, a self-supervised learning framework is developed to integrate these multi-dimensional relationships and generate device embeddings enriched with relational semantics. In this learning framework, the relationship hypergraph is augmented into two distinct views to enhance semantic information. A parameter-sharing hypergraph neural network is then utilized to learn device embeddings from both views. To further enhance embedding quality, a CCA approach is applied, allowing the comparison of data between the two views. Finally, the trustworthiness of devices is calculated based on the learned device embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HSLCCA method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithm in effectively identifying trusted devices.",

      "content": "arXiv:2506.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This paper shows that generative diffusion processes converge to associative memory systems at vanishing noise levels and characterizes the stability, robustness, memorization, and generation dynamics of both model classes. Morse-Smale dynamical systems are shown to be universal approximators of associative memory models, with diffusion processes as their white-noise perturbations. The universal properties of associative memory that follow are used to characterize a generic transition from generation to memory as noise diminishes. Structural stability of Morse-Smale flows -- that is, the robustness of their global critical point structure -- implies the stability of both trajectories and invariant measures for diffusions in the zero-noise limit. The learning and generation landscapes of these models appear as parameterized families of gradient flows and their stochastic perturbations, and the bifurcation theory for Morse-Smale systems implies that they are generically stable except at isolated parameter values, where enumerable sets of local and global bifurcations govern transitions between stable systems in parameter space. These landscapes are thus characterized by ordered bifurcation sequences that create, destroy, or alter connections between rest points and are robust under small stochastic or deterministic perturbations. The framework is agnostic to model formulation, which we verify with examples from energy-based models, denoising diffusion models, and classical and modern Hopfield networks. We additionally derive structural stability criteria for Hopfield-type networks and find that simple cases violate them. Collectively, our geometric approach provides insight into the classification, stability, and emergence of memory and generative landscapes.",

      "content": "arXiv:2505.15813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Understanding functional representations within higher visual cortex is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. While artificial neural networks pretrained on large-scale datasets exhibit striking representational alignment with human neural responses, learning image-computable models of visual cortex relies on individual-level, large-scale fMRI datasets. The necessity for expensive, time-intensive, and often impractical data acquisition limits the generalizability of encoders to new subjects and stimuli. BraInCoRL uses in-context learning to predict voxelwise neural responses from few-shot examples without any additional finetuning for novel subjects and stimuli. We leverage a transformer architecture that can flexibly condition on a variable number of in-context image stimuli, learning an inductive bias over multiple subjects. During training, we explicitly optimize the model for in-context learning. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, our model learns to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. We demonstrate that BraInCoRL consistently outperforms existing voxelwise encoder designs in a low-data regime when evaluated on entirely novel images, while also exhibiting strong test-time scaling behavior. The model also generalizes to an entirely new visual fMRI dataset, which uses different subjects and fMRI data acquisition parameters. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. Finally, we show that our framework enables interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity.",
