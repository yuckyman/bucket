      "title": "The impact of CSF-filled cavities on scalp EEG and its implications",
      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "BACKGROUND: Optimal visual function is essential in aviation to ensure flight safety and mission effectiveness. Pachychoroid neovasculopathy is a relatively recently recognized clinical entity of choroidal neovascularization, belonging to the pachychoroid spectrum, for which intravitreal therapy (IVT) is the standard of care. The main aeromedical considerations are degradation of visual function from disease progression, which could preclude aircrew from flying duties, and the compatibility of...",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that the current human resource capacity for eye care in southern Ethiopia remains below the recommended thresholds outlined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the IAPB Africa Strategic Plan. Furthermore, the distribution of eye care professionals is uneven, with the majority living in urban centers, whereas many rural areas remain critically underserved. These disparities suggest the need for more targeted workforce planning and support...",
