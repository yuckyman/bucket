      "title": "Flexible Working Memory in the Peripheral Nervous System",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) representations that are distributed across the brain can be flexibly recruited to best guide behavior. For instance, information may be represented relatively more strongly in visual cortex when a WM task requires fine visual detail, or more strongly in motor cortex when a specific response can be prepared. If WM is geared to prospectively guide actions, then we might also expect such task-oriented neural signals to propagate to the peripheral sensors and effectors that realize WM goals. Likewise, there is now evidence that oculomotor signals like saccade biases can track simple visuo-spatial WM features. However, it is unclear if such signatures are functionally meaningful, and how much information is contained in them. Here, we test the idea that WM content is adaptively distributed across the nervous system according to behavioral demands. Namely, we test whether visual WM stimulus features are expressed in patterns of both eye and hand movements during a WM delay, and whether the distribution of such peripheral motor activity shifts with the task context. In a delayed recall task, we manipulated how human participants reported their memory by having them either draw a line or adjust a wheel to match a remembered orientation. Via eye- and stylus-tracking, we found that remembered orientations were decodable from small inflections in both gaze and hand movements during the blank WM delay. Moreover, this decoding strength varied by response format: gaze patterns tracked memorized features relatively better in the wheel condition (vs. draw), while hand movements were better in the draw condition (vs. wheel). Individuals who showed greater wheel benefits in gaze-based decoding also showed greater draw benefits in hand-based decoding, suggesting a strategic processing shift to the more relevant system. Therefore, visually encoded WM contents may be adaptively allocated to the most task-relevant motor effectors, balancing WM representations across peripheral activity according to behavioral needs.",

      "content": "IntroductionMental health care is undermined by fragmented data collection, as incomplete datasets can compromise treatment efficacy and research. The BrainHealth Databank (BHDB) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) establishes the governance and infrastructure for a Learning Mental Health System that integrates digital tools, measurement-based care, artificial intelligence (AI), and open science to deliver personalized, data-driven care.MethodsCentral to the BHDB\u2019s approach is its comprehensive governance framework, which actively engages clinicians, researchers, data scientists, privacy and ethics experts, and patient and family partners. This codesigned approach ensures that digital health technologies are deployed ethically, securely, and effectively within clinical settings.ResultsBy aligning data collection with clinical and research goals and harmonizing over 12 million data points from 33,000 patient trajectories, the BHDB enhances data quality, enables real-time decision support, and fosters continuous improvement.DiscussionThe BHDB provides a model for integrating AI and digital tools into mental health care, as well as research data collection, analyses, storage, and sharing through the BHDB Portal (https://bhdb.camh.ca).",

      "title": "Leveraging neuroinformatics to understand cognitive phenotypes in elite athletes through systems neuroscience",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the cognitive phenotypes of elite athletes offers a unique perspective on the intricate interplay between neurological traits and high-performance behaviors. This study aligns with advancing neuroinformatics by proposing a novel framework designed to capture and analyze the multi-dimensional dependencies of cognitive phenotypes using systems neuroscience methodologies. Traditional approaches often face limitations in disentangling the latent factors influencing cognitive variability or in preserving interpretable data structures.MethodsTo address these challenges, we developed the Latent Cognitive Embedding Network (LCEN), an innovative model that combines biologically inspired constraints with state-of-the-art neural architectures. The model features a specialized embedding mechanism for disentangling latent factors and a tailored optimization strategy incorporating domain-specific priors and regularization techniques.ResultsExperimental evaluations demonstrate LCEN's superiority in predicting and interpreting cognitive phenotypes across diverse datasets, providing deeper insights into the neural underpinnings of elite performance.DiscussionThis work bridges computational modeling, neuroscience, and psychology, contributing to the broader understanding of cognitive variability in specialized populations.",

      "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",
