      "title": "Assessing the eligibility of Brainomix e-ASPECTS for acute stroke imaging",
      "content": "BackgroundTimely and accurate assessment of acute ischemic stroke is crucial for determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy. The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) is a widely used tool for evaluating early ischemic changes on non-contrast CT (NCCT), but its interpretation is subject to interobserver variability. Brainomix e-ASPECTS is an automated software designed to standardize and expedite this assessment. We aimed to evaluate the clinical utility and diagnostic performance of the Brainomix e-ASPECTS software in an unselected, real-world cohort of patients undergoing NCCT for suspected acute ischemic stroke.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 1,029 NCCT studies from 954 patients between March 2020 and December 2024. e-ASPECTS scores were compared to radiologist-assigned ASPECTS, which served as the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and correlation between scoring methods were assessed.ResultsThere was a strong correlation between e-ASPECTS and radiologist ASPECTS (\u03c1\u202f=\u202f0.953, p\u202f<\u202f0.001). For detecting acute ischemia, sensitivity was 95.8% (95% CI, 93.6\u201397.3%), specificity 96.9% (95% CI, 94.7\u201398.2%), and overall accuracy 96.3% (95% CI, 95.1\u201397.5%). The positive predictive value was 97.2% (95% CI, 95.3\u201398.4%), and the negative predictive value was 95.3% (95% CI, 92.8\u201396.9%). Score concordance was high, with exact matches in 92.3% of cases and a\u202f\u2264\u202f1-point difference in 97.7%. Misclassification for thrombectomy eligibility (ASPECTS < 6) occurred in four cases (0.4%). The software achieved a processing success rate of 91.9%.ConclusionE-ASPECTS demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and strong agreement with expert radiological assessment, supporting its role as a valuable decision support tool in acute stroke imaging. However, its use should complement, not replace, expert interpretation, particularly in patients with low ASPECTS scores, where treatment decisions are most sensitive.",

      "title": "Reevaluating the classification of pediatric speech sound disorders: a ground truthing perspective",
      "content": "Pediatric Speech Sound Disorders (SSDs) are conventionally diagnosed using auditory-perceptual assessments, heavily relying on International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcriptions. This approach, while prevalent, is increasingly criticized due to inherent perceptual biases, limited sensitivity to subtle speech motor variations, and insufficient reflection of underlying speech mechanisms. This paper critically re-examines a widely used diagnostic classification system for pediatric SSDs, namely Dodd\u2019s Model of Differential Diagnosis (MDD), emphasizing the limitations of perceptual methods and advocating for instrumental techniques to address significant ground truthing issues. Critical analysis in this paper integrates evidence from perceptual research, instrumental phonetics, and speech motor development studies, highlighting discrepancies between traditional classification methods and modern instrumental data. Findings indicate profound limitations in current auditory-perceptual classification methods, particularly regarding their inability to detect subtle motoric impairments such as jaw sliding, covert motor contrasts, and undifferentiated tongue gestures. Evidence from instrumental studies supports a speech-motor rather than purely cognitive-linguistic basis for many pediatric SSDs, revealing significant inadequacies in current clinical practices. To avoid the narrow interpretation of \u201cmotor speech\u201d as referring only to childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) or dysarthria, we explicitly broaden its scope to include a wider range of motoric influences on SSDs. Given these critical ground truthing concerns, the paper proposes adopting instrumental-based methodologies that offer greater precision in identifying underlying motor-based impairments, thereby promoting a more accurate and nuanced understanding of pediatric SSDs. Furthermore, the discussion advocates for adopting a dimensional rather than categorical classification framework, emphasizing gradual developmental trajectories and foundational speech motor skills. Aligning with modern precision medicine principles, the proposed approach aims to refine diagnostic accuracy, improve intervention effectiveness, and ultimately enhance clinical outcomes for children with SSDs.",

      "title": "Cellular mechanisms underlying the pro-cognitive effects of serotonin 5-HT7 receptors in a mouse model of schizophrenia",
      "content": "Serotonin 5-HT7 receptors (5-HT7Rs) have emerged as promising targets for treating cognitive and affective disturbances in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders, yet their cellular substrates and circuit-level mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we combined immunohistochemistry, multisite electrophysiology, and behavioral assays to investigate how 5-HT7Rs modulate hippocampal-prefrontal pathways in healthy mice and in a subchronic phencyclidine (sPCP) model of cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. We found that 5-HT7Rs are abundantly expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), with high co-expression in PV+ and SST+ interneurons (~80% in dHPC; 55% PV+ and 75% SST+ in mPFC). In healthy mice, systemic 5-HT7R activation with the agonist AS-19 suppressed neuronal activity and synchrony within dHPC (CA1) - mPFC (PL) pathways, reducing theta and high-gamma power, theta-gamma coupling in CA1, theta coherence, and CA1-to-PL directional connectivity, consistent with recruitment of inhibitory microcircuits. The similarity between 5-HT7R-mediated inhibition and the circuit effects we previously described for 5-HT1AR activation, together with evidence for 5-HT7R-5-HT1AR heterodimerization, suggests that these receptors act in concert to dynamically constrain hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. sPCP treatment induced persistent recognition-memory impairments, heightened anxiety-like behavior, and pathological high-frequency synchronization of hippocampal-prefrontal networks. Blockade of 5-HT7Rs with SB-269970 or the atypical antipsychotic lurasidone (but not lurasidone combined with AS-19) rescued memory performance, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and normalized aberrant high-frequency hypersynchrony, while enhancing CA1-to-PL theta signaling immediately before memory acquisition. Together, these findings indicate that 5-HT7R activation exerts potent inhibitory control over hippocampal-prefrontal pathways, likely via PV and SST interneurons, and suggest that 5-HT7R blockade constitutes a promising therapeutic strategy to restore excitation-inhibition balance and enhance neural communication within brain circuits crucial for cognition and mood regulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "content": "Background: Existing studies estimate harmony values using the color harmony model, but how these values are reflected in distinct neural stages (early automatic vs. late evaluative) and shape subjective preferences remains unexamined. Methods: To fill this gap, we recorded behavioral and event-related potential data (N=30 adults, age: 29.20{+/-}2.38 years old) to examine whether the predictions of color harmony theory regarding harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations align with neural activity from a color perception paradigm. Results: Behavioral results showed that two-color combinations received higher aesthetic pleasantness ratings than three-color combinations, while the ratings for color harmony were relatively smaller than for disharmony. Univariate ERP analysis revealed that P1 amplitude for harmonious color was significantly higher than for disharmonious color, particularly when three colors were present. In contrast, the amplitude and latency of P2 were significantly impacted by the number of colors. Additionally, multivariate pattern analysis further demonstrated that neural activity reliably differentiated between harmonious vs. disharmonious color combinations and two-color vs. three-color combinations during both P1 and P2 time window. Conclusions: These findings indicate that harmonious versus disharmonious color combinations subtly influenced early visual processing, while the number of colors used in the design had a stronger influence on aesthetic judgments.",

      "title": "Alignment of Artificial Neural Networks with Human Eye Movement Patterns in Facial Expression Recognition",
      "content": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become powerful tools for modeling human perception and behavior, yet it remains unclear if they resemble the sequential eye movement strategies humans employ during visual processing. Human studies demonstrate that the first two fixations play distinct roles in face processing: the initial fixation (Fix I) captures global configurational information, while the second (Fix II) targets local diagnostic details, with the two working collaboratively to support recognition. In this study, we tested if such properties emerge in ANNs trained for facial expression recognition. We fine-tuned a convolutional neural network (VGG16) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) on multiple facial expression datasets and evaluated their performance on the same images used in a human eye-tracking experiment. Human participants (N = 28) achieved a mean accuracy of 84.2%, VGG reached 82.9%, and ViT outperformed both at 90.0%. Perturbation analyses showed that both models aligned with the independent functions of Fix I and Fix II, but only ViT displayed a synergistic effect when information from both fixations was combined. Layer-wise analyses revealed stronger correspondence with Fix II than Fix I in both models, while ViT uniquely captured the statistical dependencies of fixation transitions. These findings suggest that VGG primarily reflects feedforward, detail-based processing, whereas ViT supports feedback-like integration across sequential fixations. Our results indicate that current ANNs can approximate human eye movement patterns in face processing, and highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures to model sequential strategies in human visual exploration.",
