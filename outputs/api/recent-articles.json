      "title": "Show HN: Kalendis \u2013 Scheduling API (keep your UI, we handle timezones/DST)",
      "content": "<p>Kalendis is an API-first scheduling backend. You keep your UI; we handle the gnarly parts (recurrence, time zones, DST, conflict-safe bookings).<p>What it does: \u2022 MCP tool: generates typed clients and API route handlers (Next.js/Express/Fastify/Nest) so you can scaffold calls straight from your IDE/agent tooling. \u2022 Availability engine: recurring rules + one-off exceptions/blackouts, returned in a clean, queryable shape. \u2022 Bookings: conflict-safe endpoints for creating/updating/canceling slots.<p>Why we built it: We kept rebuilding the same \"hard parts\" of scheduling: time zones/DST edge cases, recurring availability, conflict-aware booking, etc.\nWe wanted a boring, reliable backend so we could ship product features without adopting a hosted scheduling UI.<p>How it's helped: We stopped re-implementing DST/recurrence math and shipped booking flows faster. One small team (just 2 developers) built a robust booking platform for their business using Kalendis\u2014they kept full control of their UX without spending lots of cycles on scheduling infrastructure. The MCP generator cut the glue code: drop in a typed client or route, call the API, move on.<p>Some tech details: \u2022 REST API with ISO-8601 timestamps and IANA time zones \u2022 Recurring availability + one-off exceptions (designed to compose cleanly) \u2022 Focused scope: users, availability, exceptions, bookings (not a monolithic suite)<p>The MCP server exposes tools like generate-frontend-client, generate-backend-client, generate-api-routes, and list-endpoints. Add to your MCP settings:<p><pre><code>  {\n   \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"kalendis\": {\n     \"command\": \"npx\",\n     \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@kalendis/mcp\"]\n    }\n   }\n  }\n\n</code></pre>\nHow to try it: Create a free account \u2192 get an API key. (<a href=\"https://kalendis.dev\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://kalendis.dev</a>). Then hit an endpoint:<p><pre><code>  curl -H \"x-api-key: $KALENDIS_API_KEY\" \\\n \"https://api.kalendis.dev/v1/availability/getAvailability?userId=&amp;start=2025-10-07T00:00:00Z&amp;end=2025-10-14T00:00:00Z&amp;includeExceptions=true\"\n</code></pre>\nHappy to answer questions and post example snippets in the thread. Thanks for taking a look!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45956154</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "A Lightweight Deep Learning Architecture for Potato Leaf Disease Detection: A Comprehensive Survey",
      "content": "Potato leaf diseases pose a serious challenge to global food security, often leading to considerable yield losses if not detected promptly. The growing maturity of deep learning has enabled automated, high-precision plant disease recognition, even on devices with limited computational resources. In this study, several lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) models--MobileNetV3 (Small and Large), EfficientNet-Lite, ShuffleNet, and SqueezeNet--are comparatively assessed for the task of potato leaf disease classification. The models were trained under identical preprocessing and fine-tuning conditions, incorporating checkpoint-based training for stability. Among the evaluated networks, ShuffleNet delivered the highest overall performance with 99% accuracy, 0.97 precision, 0.99 recall, and an F1-score of 0.98, making it well-suited for real-time field deployment. EfficientNet-Lite also demonstrated a strong balance between speed and accuracy (91.9%), outperforming both MobileNet variants. Conversely, SqueezeNet, though the most compact model, recorded lower metrics (76% accuracy), indicating limited feature discrimination capability. This analysis underscores the balance between efficiency, robustness, and predictive accuracy, providing practical insights for deploying deep learning models in precision agriculture and low-resource environments.",

      "title": "A Novel Cell-Type Specific Circadian Reporter Mouse Reveals Self-Sustained Food Entrainable Nature in Enteric Neurons",
      "content": "Global luciferase reporter gene technology is an important real-time readout for the analysis of circadian oscillations. However, because nearly all cells in the body possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators, developing cell-type-specific reporter systems is essential to dissect how these oscillators interact within complex multicellular tissues and are modulated by brain-body circadian signals. The intestine is a complex organ composed of diverse cell types with distinct origins and functions, and it exhibits robust daily rhythms in physiological activities driven by intrinsic circadian clocks. While the circadian regulation of the mucosal compartment, including the intestinal epithelium, has been relatively well characterized, the mechanisms governing the circadian rhythms in the cells of the muscularis externa remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel Cre-dependent Per2-luciferase reporter mouse that enables precise measurement of circadian oscillations in specific peripheral cell populations ex vivo and demonstrate its utility in revealing the hierarchical circadian chrono-architecture within the intestine. Ex vivo gut explants from mice expressing the reporter in one of five major cell types of the muscularis externa-enteric neurons (ENs), enteric glial cells (EGCs), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and muscularis macrophages (MMs)-exhibited robust, self-sustained circadian bioluminescence rhythms, indicating that all of these cell types possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators. Notably, ENs in the small intestine entrained more rapidly to feeding schedules than did those in the colon, revealing regional differences in food entrainment among the gut clocks. Moreover, the clocks of ENs, SMCs, and MMs shifted their phase in response to daytime-restricted feeding, whereas ICC clocks remained unaffected even after three weeks of restricted feeding. These findings demonstrate that distinct intestinal cell types possess unique entrainment properties and that feeding rhythms can induce heterogeneous phase shifts within the gut clocks. Given that circadian disruption, such as that caused by shift work, contributes to intestinal disorders, this reporter system could provide a powerful platform to dissect the mechanisms linking intercellular circadian desynchrony to intestinal homeostasis.",

      "title": "Dynamic interactions in human amygdala subregions support hierarchical processing of fearful faces",
      "content": "Fearful-expression recognition is vital for survival, relying on rapid fear detection and fine-grained face encoding. However, how human amygdala subregions differentially implement these distinct cognitive components remains unclear. Here, we recorded intracranial EEG from lateral and medial amygdala in epilepsy patients performing an emotional face-matching task, and combined multivariate decoding, time-frequency and directed-connectivity analyses with intracranial stimulation. We found that the lateral subregion exhibited early, fear-specific theta/alpha-band (4-12 Hz) activity with higher decoding accuracy and directed transfer of fear-specific information to the medial subregion, which showed delayed and sustained activation. By contrast, the medial subregion encoded face-specific information at a later stage in the 2-16 Hz band with superior decoding accuracy, and then relayed this information back to the lateral subregion. Critically, intracranial stimulation yielded double-dissociable behavioural effects, with lateral stimulation disrupting early fear detection while medial stimulation accelerated neutral-face recognition. Together, our study delineates a hierarchically organized, temporally structured division of labour within the human amygdala and show that dynamic interactions underlie hierarchical processing of fearful expressions.",
