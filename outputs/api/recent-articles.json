      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to go beyond my basic knowledge of python. So I decided code a tool which lets you copy text from any image directly to your clipboard.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong><br /> It let's you copy text from image from selection and you can copy that text directly to your clipboard.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong><br /> People who use OCR tools a lot for scanning text. They can use it to easily scan text from images.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong><br /> With other OCR text scanners you need to manually save the image and upload it for scan. But this tool allows you to scan text like a snipping tool.</p> <p>It is free and open-source. Currently available for Windows as &quot;.exe&quot; (GitHub repo has build instructions in case anyone wants to compile it from source).</p> <p>I will be improving it in the future making it more accurate and cross-platform.</p> <p>GitHub Repository Link (Star if you find it helpful!):<br /> <a href=\"https://github.com/Nabir14/oclip\">https://github.com/Nabir14/oclip</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nabir140\"> /u/Nabir140 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5ia6n/oclip_copy_text_from_image_directly/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1q5ia6n/oclip_copy_text_from_image_directly/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Here is an example:</p> <p>``` p( t&quot;&quot;&quot; Here is a long {i(&quot;paragraph&quot;)} that would otherwise be very hard to read. Using t-strings (which are optional), it can {b(&quot;improve readability&quot;)} a lot. {br()} {br()}</p> <pre><code>It is also possible to use nested t-string with variables.
