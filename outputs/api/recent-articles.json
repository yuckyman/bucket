      "content": "New viral approaches have revolutionized neuroscience by precisely delivering genes in neurons; for example, to control or monitor activity in specific neuronal cell types. In contrast, the manipulation of oli-godendrocytes requires the Cre-LoxP system and gene-by-gene engineering, breeding, and genotyping. Here we introduce OASIS (Oligodendrocyte AAV-CRISPR mediated Specific In vivo editing System), a ver-satile platform that combines SELECTIV, an AAV-receptor-based transduction strategy, with HiUGE, an NHEJ-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approach. We show efficient and specific oligodendrocyte trans-duction across the brain and tagging of endogenous cytoskeletal, myelin, cell adhesion, scaffolding, and junctional proteins. OASIS enables sparse yet reliable labeling, allowing direct visualization of subcellular protein localization with single-cell resolution. We successfully fused the biotin-ligase TurboID with endogenous oligodendroglial Neurofascin-155, thereby achieving targeted biotinylation of the axoglial junction. OASIS is rapidly customizable for any gene-of-interest. Together, OASIS overcomes longstand-ing barriers in oligodendrocyte biology, providing a powerful system for precise, customizable genome editing and subcellular visualization in the adult brain.",

      "title": "Pro-endometriosis macrophage release of IL-33 is key for endometriosis pain and lesion formation",
      "content": "Endometriosis is a painful gynecological inflammatory disease affecting up to 10% of females. When released by sensory neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) shapes immunity, a process known as neuroimmune communication. We previously showed that nociceptor-derived CGRP polarizes macrophages into pro-endometriosis macrophages (PEMs) that mediates endometrial epithelial (endo-epi) cell growth and pain. However, the key mediators involved in this PEM-induced cell growth were unknown. Using unbiased approaches, we discovered that nociceptor-derived CGRP induces IL-33 production by PEMs. IL-33 binding to its receptor ST2 is key for endometriotic lesion growth and pain during endometriosis in mice as anti-IL-33 antibody treatment reduced evoked and spontaneous pain as well as lesion size. Chemical or genetic ablation of nociceptors or macrophages also resulted in lower levels of lesion IL-33, demonstrating a neuroimmune-driven mechanism for IL-33 production during endometriosis. In humans, we found that IL-33 is correlated with increased number of glands and fibrosis in lesions and that IL-33 expression in macrophages is also associated with genetic risk of endometriosis. We also provided evidence that suggests a dual role for IL-33 in endometriosis, in which, it is initially required for lesion formation and later for lesion maintenance only, and associated pain. Therefore, targeting IL-33/ST2 signaling may effectively treat endometriosis pain.",

      "title": "Spatial learning in multi-scale environments: Roles of hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex",
      "content": "Navigation cognition involves the learning of multi-scale environments and the formation of cognitive maps. How do humans build cognitive maps in multi-scale environments? Cognitive maps are thought to be organized hierarchically, with local representations for subareas and global representations for the entire environment. However, it remains unclear how spatial learning influences the representations of multi-scale environments and their underlying neural mechanisms across different levels of representation. In the current study, we built a virtual environment (VE) with four orthogonally positioned rectangular rooms, each containing eight objects at the corners. Twenty-three healthy subjects completed a four-session spatial memory experiment conducted over two weeks. We measured their brain activity by using BOLD-fMRI at two stages: pre-learning stage and post-learning, when they were judging the relative direction between the objects within the VE. We found that with the progression of learning, the subjects shifted from relying on local, directional cues to using more global representations of the environment. At the neural level, the hippocampus (HIP), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) played distinct roles in encoding spatial information across the two learning stages. Specifically, after learning, the HIP shifted from local to global representations, while the RSC and OFC supported the integration of spatial information across these representational levels. In addition, the anterior cingulate cortex was involved in forming global representations, facilitating efficient spatial processing as learning advanced. These findings revealed how spatial learning leads to adaptive shifts in brain activity, contributing to the formation of cognitive maps in complex, multi-scale environments.",

      "title": "Visual Attention in Peripersonal Space",
      "content": "Bringing the hand near a visual stimulus enhances visual processing. This effect is linked to peripersonal space (PPS), the body-centered region where visual and proprioceptive information interact. Despite extensive behavioral evidence, the neural basis of this interaction in early visual cortex remains unclear. In this study, we investigated how hand proximity modulates orientation selectivity in area V2 by recording single-neuron responses from two rhesus monkeys. The monkeys performed a fixation task while their hand was positioned near a visual stimulus while either being visible or occluded, and compared with when the hand was away from the stimulus. When the near hand was visible, neural firing rates in V2 were significantly higher, accompanied by sharper orientation tuning. In contrast, occluding the hand broadened orientation tuning compared to when the hand was away. These effects emerged rapidly after stimulus onset and were coherent across the population, demonstrating that PPS is actively prioritized during visual processing. Together, the findings reveal two complementary (feedback) signals in V2: a congruence-driven enhancement when visual and proprioceptive inputs align, and a mismatch-driven suppression when they conflict, indicating that V2 integrates multisensory cues to encode PPS and support action-relevant visual processing.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently released Python Pest, a port of the Rust pest parsing library.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Python Pest is a declarative PEG parser generator for Python, ported from Rust's Pest. You write grammars instead of hand-coding parsing logic, and it builds parse trees automatically.</p> <p>Define a grammar using Pest version 2 syntax, like this:</p> <pre><code>jsonpath = _{ SOI ~ jsonpath_query ~ EOI } jsonpath_query = _{ root_identifier ~ segments } segments = _{ (S ~ segment)* } root_identifier = _{ &quot;$&quot; } segment = _{ | child_segment | descendant_segment } // snip </code></pre> <p>And traverse parse trees using <a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/\">structural pattern matching</a>, like this:</p> <pre><code>def parse_segment(self, segment: Pair) -&gt; Segment: match segment: case Pair(Rule.CHILD_SEGMENT, [inner]): return ChildSegment(segment, self.parse_segment_inner(inner)) case Pair(Rule.DESCENDANT_SEGMENT, [inner]): return RecursiveDescentSegment(segment, self.parse_segment_inner(inner)) case Pair(Rule.NAME_SEGMENT, [inner]) | Pair(Rule.INDEX_SEGMENT, [inner]): return ChildSegment(segment, [self.parse_selector(inner)]) case _: raise JSONPathSyntaxError(&quot;expected a segment&quot;, segment) </code></pre> <p>See <a href=\"https://jg-rp.github.io/python-pest/\">docs</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/python-pest/\">PyPi</a> for a complete example.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li>Python developers who need to parse custom languages, data formats, or DSLs.</li> <li>Anyone interested in grammar-first design over hand-coded parsers.</li> <li>Developers curious about leveraging Python's match/case for tree-walking.</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Parsimonious is another general purpose, pure Python parser package that reads parsing expression grammars. Python Pest differs in grammar syntax and subsequent tree traversal technique, preferring external iteration of parse trees instead of defining a visitor.</p> <h1>Feedback</h1> <p>I'd appreciate any feedback, especially your thoughts on the trade-off between declarative grammars and performance in Python. Does the clarity and maintainability make up for slower execution compared to hand-tuned parsers?</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest\">https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hefty-Pianist-1958\"> /u/Hefty-Pianist-1958 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ocg3p5/python_pest_a_port_of_rusts_pest/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ocg3p5/python_pest_a_port_of_rusts_pest/\">[comments]</a></span>",
