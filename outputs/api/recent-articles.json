      "title": "A robust low-dimensional manifold organizes neuronal responses to sustained input",
      "content": "Understanding how neurons transform synaptic input into spiking output remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Although neuronal responses are often described in hig-dimensional terms, it remains unclear to what extent neuronal input-output transformations are governed by lower-dimensional structure. Here, we examine the geometric organization of neuronal input-output relationships using intracellular current-clamp recordings from mouse visual cortex. By representing neuronal responses in a feature space capturing multiple aspects of spike timing and excitability, we analyze how response variability is distributed across dimensions. We find that neuronal responses are organized within a robust low-dimensional manifold that accounts for the majority of observed variance and emerges despite substantial heterogeneity in neuronal responses and stimulation conditions, indicating a general organizational constraint rather than idiosyncratic properties of individual neurons. Importantly, the identified low-dimensional manifold is not a trivial consequence of feature reduction but delineates a constrained response space within which neuronal input-output transformations are expressed. Together, these results reveal a previously underappreciated regularity in neuronal response organization and delineate geometric constraints shaping neuronal input-output mappings under sustained drive, providing a principled foundation for computational models of neuronal function.",

      "content": "Mutations in genes encoding a range of ion-conducting proteins disrupt development of the cerebral cortex in humans, often causing polymicrogyria (PMG), yet how ion conduction guides the development of cortical architecture is not clear. Here, we describe three individuals with brain malformations including PMG and microcephaly in whom de novo, missense mutations were identified in PANX1--encoding an ATP and ion conducting channel. We show that these PMG-associated PANX1 mutations (p.D14H, p.M37R, and p.N338T) disrupt normal glycosylation and confer gain-of-function with respect to ATP release and channel conductance. In vivo modeling of PANX1 mutant forms in cortical progenitor cells demonstrated disrupted cell migration and cell fate, including excess cell death in both mice and ferret models. Modeling the N338T allele in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons further revealed how conductance changes lead to functional consequences of increased excitability and synchronicity. Our results show that normal PANX1 function contributes to cortical structure through regulation of ion conductance and ATP release and provides insight into how these processes influence corticogenesis and cytoarchitecture more broadly.",

      "title": "Formation, stability, and competition in dendritic proto-spines",
      "content": "Over 80 % of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain terminate on dendritic spines, which support key functions of memory storage and computation. Despite the neurodevelopmental and computational implications of spine formation, little is known about the interplay of physical and chemical signaling mechanisms that govern spine initiation. We developed a physics-based model for the formation, stability, and placement of membrane protrusions (proto-spines) triggered by membrane-bending proteins such as IRSp53, and activated by neurotransmitter inputs. We identify two distinct proto-spine energy manifolds depending on the concentration of activated IRSp53, causing shallow and sharp geometries respectively. The sharp proto-spines exhibit properties of wave-pinning models, including stimulus-local formation, positional stability, and merging, but unlike the wave-pinning model they also exhibit competition. We linked the physics-based model to a mass-action chemistry model of neurotransmitter-driven signaling pathway activation of IRSp53 to simulate proto-spine formation in response to neurotransmitter stimulus patterns. Multiple proto-spines compete for IRSp53, leading to inter-spine spacing of 1 - 3 m, similar to experiments. Correlated and spatially clustered synaptic input enhances proto-spine lifetime and density compared to non-correlated stimuli. Finally, we tested the effects of autism spectrum disorder-related mutations in spine-formation signaling, leading to altered RhoGEF activity. We found that elevated RhoGEF activity increased proto-spine density and reduced their lifetime, consistent with ASD phenotypes. Overall, our analysis shows that the interplay between membrane bending mechanics and reaction-diffusion chemistry creates rich proto-spine dynamics and concisely captures key features of early spine formation.",

It acts as an intelligent proxy that:<br /> 1. Rotates Keys: Automatically cycles through your provided API keys to maximize rate limits.<br /> 2. Auto-Fallbacks: If one provider (e.g., Groq) is exhausted or down, it seamlessly switches to the next available one (e.g., Gemini).<br /> 3. Unifies Syntax: You use one simple client.chat() method, and it handles the specific formatting for each provider behind the scenes.<br /> 4. Supports Streaming: Full support for token streaming for chat applications. </p> <p>Target Audience<br /> This tool is meant for developers, students, and researchers who are building MVPs, prototypes, or hobby projects.<br /> - Production? It is not recommended for mission-critical production workloads (yet), as it relies on free tiers which can be unpredictable.<br /> - Perfect for: Hackathons, testing different models (GPT-4o vs Llama 3), and running personal AI assistants without a credit card. </p> <p>Comparison<br /> There are other libraries like LiteLLM or LangChain that unify API syntax, but FreeFlow differs in its focus on &quot;Free Tier Optimization&quot;.<br /> - vs LiteLLM/LangChain: Those libraries are great for connecting to any provider, but you still hit rate limits on a single key immediately. FreeFlow is specifically architected to handle multiple keys and multiple providers as a single pool of resources to maximize uptime for free users.<br /> - vs Manual Implementation: Writing your own try/except loops to switch from Groq to Gemini is tedious and messy. FreeFlow handles the context management, session closing, and error handling for you. </p> <p>Example Usage: </p> <p><code>pip install freeflow-llm</code></p> <pre><code># Automatically uses keys from your environment variables with FreeFlowClient() as client: response = client.chat( messages=[{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Explain quantum computing&quot;}] ) print(response.content) </code></pre> <p>Links<br /> - Source Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/thesecondchance/freeflow-llm\">https://github.com/thesecondchance/freeflow-llm</a><br /> - Documentation: <a href=\"http://freeflow-llm.joshsparks.dev/docs\">http://freeflow-llm.joshsparks.dev/docs</a><br /> - PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/freeflow-llm/\">https://pypi.org/project/freeflow-llm/</a> </p> <p>It's MIT Licensed and open source.

      "title": "Severity-dependent proteomic alterations in the rat hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus",
      "content": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged seizure state that can induce lasting hippocampal damage and promote the development of spontaneous seizures and cognitive deficits. The severity and duration of SE strongly influence these long-term outcomes; however, many experimental studies rely on behavioral assessments such as the Racine scale, which may not capture subclinical or non-convulsive seizure activity. Consequently, the molecular consequences of lower-severity seizures that do not meet conventional criteria for severe SE, but may nonetheless contribute to epileptogenesis, remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated whether behavioral seizure severity in the pilocarpine model correlates with distinct proteomic alterations in the hippocampus. Seizures were induced in adult male rats using pilocarpine, and animals were behaviorally classified into three groups: control, mild SE, and severe SE. Hippocampal tissue was collected from control (n = 3), mild SE (n = 5), and severe SE (n = 6) rats and subjected to mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Proteomic profiles were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using volcano plots. Functional enrichment analyses were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases. Our findings revealed distinct hippocampal proteomic signatures across control, mild SE, and severe SE groups, as revealed by PLS-DA. Severe SE was associated with widespread proteomic alterations, including 129 DEPs linked to synaptic structure, RNA regulation, and metabolic processes. In contrast, mild SE was associated with fewer changes (81 DEPs), primarily involving synaptic organization and endocytosis. A direct comparison of the severe and mild SE groups identified 76 DEPs enriched in pathways related to synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Notably, 23 proteins showed a stepwise expression pattern across groups, suggesting a molecular gradient correlated with seizure severity. Correlation analyses identified and further confirmed glial and inflammatory molecules as candidate molecular markers associated with seizure burden. In conclusion, behavioral seizure severity in the pilocarpine model corresponds to distinct hippocampal proteomic profiles, with severe SE inducing broader and more pronounced molecular alterations than mild SE. Importantly, lower-severity SE is associated with biologically meaningful changes in pathways related to synaptic organization and cellular processing, highlighting mechanistic differences between mild and severe SE that may contribute to epileptogenic progression.",

      "title": "Preparation and application of YFV-17D-derived Anterograde Trans-neuronal Viral Vectors for Neuroscience Research",
      "content": "Trans-neuronal viruses that spread between synaptically connected neurons have become invaluable tools in neuroscience, enabling circuit mapping and targeted delivery of genetic material to cells within defined pathways. Although most available trans-neuronal viral tracers propagate retrogradely, an anterograde trans-neuronal virus that spread from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons would substantially expand experimental capabilities. We previously demonstrated that YFV-17D--a live attenuated yellow fever vaccine used clinically for decades--spreads anterogradely along neuronal circuits. We further developed a suite of recombinant YFV-17D-based vectors for diverse applications, including tracing monosynaptic projectome of defined neuronal cell types, multiplex mapping of parallel pathways, and trans-neuronal genetic manipulation with minimal neurotoxicity. We have now tested and optimized procedures for vector production and application. Based on these optimizations, here, we present a two part guide for preparing and deploying this viral vector system to map brain connectivity. The first part describes the molecular biology and cell culture workflows required to generate high quality viral vectors, yielding titers of ~1x10^10 to 5x10^11 genomic copies per milliliter within approximately two weeks. The second part outlines optimized animal procedures, including intracranial injections, perioperative care, and experimental considerations tailored to specific aims and vector variants. Depending on the application, efficient trans-neuronal tracing can be achieved within 1-4 weeks following delivery.",
