      "title": "A linear regression model predicts human brain ageing and reveals differential neuronal biological ageing relevant for Parkinson's disease susceptibility",
      "content": "Biological brain ageing is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, which are characterized by selective degeneration of particular neuron types. We analyzed the impact of ageing on the transcriptome of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and locus coeruleus (LC), that show differential vulnerabilities to Parkinson disease. Neurons were isolated from human post mortem brain tissues originating from 48 individuals ranging from 17 to 102 years of age and subjected to Smart-seq2 RNA sequencing. We identified 2,764 genes that were correlated with chronological ageing. This gene expression data was used to develop a feature selection-based Time Traversal algorithm, utilizing functionally grouped gene sets, GO terms, with high predictive accuracy of biological brain ageing. We identified 59 GO terms that can predict biological age using a linear regression model, where leave-one-out cross validation demonstrated a strong correlation between chronological age and predicted biological age (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.946; adjusted R2 = 0.771). The algorithm was validated on five independent datasets with high predictive performance, demonstrating shared ageing features across the human brain. Nonetheless, our analysis also highlights brain region and neuron type specificity in particular ageing features. Resilient neurons showed a weaker association with age-related transcriptional changes, indicating that they age slower than their vulnerable counterparts, thus revealing targets that may be used to slow down ageing and prevent disease development.",

      "title": "Modeling the Co-existence of NMDAR-Dependent and AMPAR-Regulated Long-Term Potentiation/Depression",
      "content": "In this work, we develop a mathematical model that captures both the early and late phases of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-Term Depression (LTD) within an NMDAR-dependent and AMPA-regulated framework. The model combines multiple essential properties. First, it emphasizes a detailed representation of biochemical processes within the postsynaptic neuron, thereby illustrating the interaction between LTD and distinct forms of LTP. Second, the dynamic modulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptor conductance is represented through nonlinear differential equations and algebraic relations. Third, the model incorporates input specificity, associativity, and cooperativity, allowing synaptic changes at one site to influence the strength of neighboring synapses. These features provide a comprehensive description of synaptic dynamics, allowing the simulation of plasticity at both the cellular and the network levels. Overall, the model offers a valuable framework for studying NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD by explicitly incorporating AMPA currents. We believe that this model provides deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and paves the way for the construction of network-level models by linking multiple cells through AMPA receptor conductance.",

      "title": "Dissociating mechanisms of heart-voice coupling",
      "content": "In a landmark paper in JASA, Orlikoff & Baken (1989a) demonstrated that the heartbeat echoes through acoustic features of the human voice. Heart-voice coupling questions how vocal control is functionally regulated under these perturbations. It has many potential engineering applications that extract heart rate from human voice and speech, with underutilized potential for cardiac monitoring from (wild) animal calls. However, laboratory phonology and bioacoustics seem to have forgotten about the phenomenon, such that the physiological underpinnings of heart-voice coupling have been left unexplained. In the current contribution, we show that vocal acoustics contain signatures of the heartbeat as originally reported by Orlikoff & Baken (1989a). More specifically, we analysed the steady-state vowel vocalizations of 17 participants and found a significant relationship between the vocal amplitude envelope and the cardiac activity (ECG). Furthermore, we conducted two empirical tests to dissociate between glottal (vocal fold vascularization) and subglottal (heart-lung interaction) mechanisms of heart-voice coupling. In addition to a stable heart-voice coupling, we also found a significant heart-expiration coupling during conditions of pure expiration. Since the vocal folds are abducted during expiration, this result demonstrates that subglottal mechanisms that modulate expiratory flow must be involved in heart-voice coupling. We argue that the heart rhythm needs to be considered as a weakly coupled pattern generator that possibly shaped the evolution of vocal and speech production.",

      "title": "Distinct functional roles across hippocampal subfields in anticipation to event boundaries during schema learning",
      "content": "Continuous experiences are constantly segmented into separate events in memory, which is accompanied by increased hippocampal activity at the boundaries between these events. Extracting knowledge across all these experiences about what type of events to expect in a certain environment leads to event schemas being represented in the brain. These event schemas help to predict future events. What are the differences across the various distinct hippocampal subfields in peaks of activity around event boundaries? And what is the influence of event schema learning on these hippocampal subfield peaks? Here, this was investigated using data from an fMRI experiment in which participants learned two (related) event schemas by exposure to many similar animated videos of wedding ceremonies in a novel fictional culture. Results revealed that the hippocampus (CA1, CA2/3, dentate gyrus and subiculum) showed peaks in activity before event boundaries. Interestingly, the CA1, CA2/3 and dentate gyrus pre-boundary peaks attenuated due to event schema learning. This provides evidence for these subfields signaling uncertainty about upcoming events in the seconds prior to event boundaries. These results give a more precise understanding about the temporal dynamics around event boundaries in the distinct hippocampal subfields, and how these hippocampal subfields' responses interact with schema learning.",

      "title": "Neuronal excitability is permanently altered by activity manipulation during an embryonic critical period in Drosophila",
      "content": "Neuronal intrinsic excitability provides the baseline that homeostatic mechanisms act to preserve, yet the processes that establish a baseline remain poorly defined. Developmental critical periods (CPs) are thought to play a central role, but the link between early activity and long-term intrinsic properties is not well characterised. To address this, we used the genetic tractability of the Drosophila larval locomotor circuit to manipulate individual neurons during an embryonic CP. Following optogenetic excitation or inhibition, during the CP, we assessed intrinsic excitability of the same neurons in third-instar larvae (i.e. ~5 days thereafter). We compared an excitatory premotor interneuron (A27h), an inhibitory premotor interneuron (A31k), and a motor neuron (aCC). Both interneurons exhibited anti-homeostatic responses: excitatory perturbation increased intrinsic excitability, while inhibitory perturbation decreased it, effects that persisted throughout larval development. In contrast, motor neurons showed no significant changes under the same conditions, revealing cell type-specific sensitivity to early activity. These findings build on the general principles of the functional relationships between CP activity and neuronal excitability and how intrinsic excitability is not passively set but actively shaped during these windows, with long-lasting, neuron-specific consequences. More broadly, our results highlight how developmental perturbations can alter the excitatory:inhibitory balance of mature neural circuits that may contribute to the aetiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Miniscope Processing Suite (MPS): An Intuitive, No-Code, Scalable Pipeline for Long Duration Calcium Imaging",
      "content": "Miniscope calcium imaging provides a unique window into the activity of neurons during behavior while enabling spatial localization of individual cells across time. Despite its potential to revolutionize in vivo imaging alongside the rise of optogenetic tools, miniscopes remain underutilized. This gap may stem from the lack of an easy-to-use preprocessing software tailored to miniscope data. To address this need, we developed the first no-code end-to-end scalable pipeline for preprocessing large miniscope recordings: the Miniscope Processing Suite (MPS). MPS is the first implementation of Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (CNMF) with Nonnegative Double Singular Value Decomposition (NNDSVD) initialization, multi-lasso segmentation, and parallelized temporal and spatial updates, enabling analysis of recordings exceeding three hours on a standard hardware. We tested a large dataset consisting of 28 operant behavior sessions (77 hrs, 7.26 TB of video data) on a single workstation. MPS completed the analysis in 55.6 hrs, (averaging 0.72 minute of processing time per minute of recording), which is 10-20X faster than traditional pipelines. Packaged as an easy downloadable plug-and-play software with a graphical user interface and requiring no coding or Git experience, MPS lowers the barrier to miniscope analysis while improving on current methodologies.",

      "title": "Orthographic training finetunes a neuronal letter position code in primate visual cortex",
      "content": "Reading is an acquired skill that enhances brain activity in human visual cortex and is thought to repurpose preexisting ventral visual circuitry for the fast parallel processing of letter strings. However, the neuronal code underlying position-invariant written word recognition remains elusive. Here, we examined this issue in a macaque monkey model before and after orthographic training. Based on prior simulations of reading acquisition in a convolutional neural network model of the ventral visual pathway, we hypothesized the existence of neurons sensitive to both specific letters and their ordinal position within the word, which should be enhanced by orthographic training. By wirelessly recorded neural activity from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaque monkeys trained on orthographic tasks over five successive days, we indeed discovered IT neurons tuned to letters and sensitive to either ordinal or retinotopic positions. Ordinal units existed prior to training, but their responses were enhanced after training, matching with behavioral improvements in word recognition. These findings support the neuronal recycling hypothesis and demonstrate, at the single-cell level, how reading refines pre-existing neural circuits to facilitate fluent word recognition.",
