      "title": "Spatiotemporal Divergence Between Intrinsic And Evoked Cortical Activity Predicts Visual Detection.",
      "content": "The threshold for sensory detection varies with fluctuations in intrinsic cortical activity. When stimulus-encoding cortical populations are more excitable, stimuli elicit stronger neural responses that are more likely to be detected. However, the detection of a stimulus is also more likely when cortical populations are less excitable because there is less background 'noise'. Therefore, it is unclear how the variable states of intrinsic and sensory-evoked cortical activity and their interactions impact sensory detection. We hypothesize the answer depends on the spatiotemporal structure of intrinsic activity states across sensory encoding and non-encoding populations. To test this, we examined intrinsic and target-evoked population activity across cortical Area MT in common marmosets while they performed a threshold visual detection task. We compared detection performance based on target-evoked responses and the state of intrinsic activity in the larger surrounding population. We find that the intrinsic activity in the surrounding, non-encoding population predicted trial-by-trial detection performance better than the population encoding the target evoked response. Furthermore, we find that the detection performance of the monkey was best predicted by the divergence in excitability between the encoding and surrounding non-encoding population. These findings suggest that, rather than a source of noise or irrelevant to sensory processing, the distributed spatiotemporal state of intrinsic activity directly influences how sensory signals are represented in cortical populations and can influence perceptual thresholds in visual detection.",

      "title": "Good dog, bad wolf: Debunking evolutionary preparedness to fear wolves",
      "content": "The return of wolves to historical ranges often causes strong opposition, contrasting with widespread affection for domestic dogs. Evolutionary accounts suggest this discrepancy stems from deeply ingrained affective responses that predispose humans to fear wolves while fostering positive attachment to dogs. Using neuroimaging and self-report data from 42 participants, we investigated how defensive neural circuits linked to implicit threat detection are related to explicit threat evaluations of the two species. During functional MRI, participants viewed images of wolves, dogs, and snakes - the latter chosen for their strong engagement of predisposed threat-related responses - displaying either aggressive or non-aggressive behaviours. As predicted, aggressive displays of all species elicited stronger neural responses in threat-related brain areas. Snakes elicited stronger subcortical threat responses than wolves or dogs, while neural responses to wolves and dogs were largely indistinguishable when comparing aggressive displays. However, explicit threat evaluations strongly differed: wolves were perceived and rated as significantly more threatening than dogs, especially when the species exhibited aggressive displays. Together, these findings challenge accounts that humans are predisposed for negative responses to wolves, suggesting instead that our attitudes towards the species are shaped primarily by deliberate-evaluative processes rather than by implicit-automatic threat responses. This underscores the role of experience, knowledge, stereotypes, and socio-cultural mechanisms in shaping public perceptions of human-wildlife conflicts and conservation efforts. These results provide new insights into the cognitive and affective foundations of human-animal relationships, informing efforts to improve human-wildlife coexistence.",

      "title": "Decoding semantic categories: insights from an fMRI ALE meta analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The human brain organizes conceptual knowledge into semantic categories; however, the extent to which these categories share common or distinct neural representations remains unclear. This study aims to clarify this organizational structure by identifying consistent, modality-controlled activation patterns across several widely used and frequently investigated semantic domains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. By quantifying the distinctiveness and overlap among these patterns, we provide a more precise foundation for understanding the brain\u2019s semantic architecture, as well as for applications such as semantic brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI). Approach. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 fMRI studies covering six semantic categories: animals, tools, food, music, body parts, and pain. Using activation likelihood estimation, we identified convergent activation patterns for each category while controlling for stimulus modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and written). Subsequently, Jaccard-based overlap analyses were performed to quantify the degree of neural commonality and separability across concept-modality pairs, thereby revealing the underlying structure of representational similarity. Main results. Distinct yet partially overlapping activation networks were identified for each semantic category. Tools and animals showed shared activity in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal regions, reflecting common object-based visual processing. In contrast, food-related stimuli primarily recruited limbic and subcortical structures associated with affective and motivational processing. Music and animal sounds overlapped within the superior temporal and insular cortices, whereas body parts and pain engaged occipito-parietal and cingulo-insular networks, respectively. Together, these findings reveal a hierarchically organized and modality-dependent semantic architecture in the human brain. Significance. This meta-analysis offers a quantitative and integrative characterization of how semantic knowledge is distributed and differentiated across cortical systems. By demonstrating how conceptual content and sensory modality jointly shape neural organization, the study refines theoretical models of semantic cognition and provides a methodological basis for evaluating conceptual separability. These insights have direct implications for semantic neural decoding and for the development of BCI systems grounded in meaning-based neural representations.",

We find that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM reach adult-level and near adult-level performance on our ToM tasks overall, and that GPT-4 exceeds adult performance on 6th order inferences. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between model size and finetuning for higher-order ToM performance, and that the linguistic abilities of large models may support more complex ToM inferences. Given the important role that higher-order ToM plays in group social interaction and relationships, these findings have significant implications for the development of a broad range of social, educational and assistive LLM applications.",

      "content": "Preterm birth and other perinatal adversities lead to loss of placental support including critical hormones, such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), required for neurodevelopment. Decreased IGF1 and preterm birth are associated with neurodevelopmental disorder risk, including autism spectrum disorder. Whether placental Igf1 insufficiency impacts these neurodevelopmental risks is not understood. To understand these mechanisms, placental-targeted CRISPR manipulation in mice was employed to create placental Igf1 insufficiency. Subsequently, embryonic forebrain development was assessed sex-specifically to identify structural and transcriptomic changes. Postnatal offspring were used to determine neurobehavioral trajectories relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders as assessed through learning, motor, and affective behavioral tasks and neurostereology. Placental Igf1 insufficiency reduced embryonic forebrain growth, including decreased cell population across males and females. Embryonic forebrain transcriptomics revealed sex-specific alterations. Autism relevant developmental pathways were downregulated in male forebrain, driven by genes including Reln and Lama1. Altered genes in female forebrain were enriched for autism-risk genes including Grin2b and Dync1h1. Following these transcriptomic differences, postnatal neurobehavioral trajectories were sex specific. Male offspring uniquely showed reduced motor learning, increased stereotyped behaviors, altered reversal learning, and reduced forebrain neuronal number. Female offspring displayed opposite behavioral changes as males and few changes in forebrain structure. The provision of Igf1 specifically from placenta is critical for offspring forebrain development. This temporary early deficit has persistent sex-specific neurobehavioral effects. These outcomes have relevance for autism risk and highlight mechanisms that could facilitate intervention development for adverse outcomes after early loss of placental hormone support in perinatal adversity.",

      "title": "Cortical deviance detection represents a canonical difference signal",
      "content": "Context modulates neural processing of sensory stimuli. Neural responses are suppressed to stimuli that are typical in their context and augmented to stimuli that deviate from their context. The latter has been conceptualized as a prediction error, which can serve to enhance the salience, direct attention, or support learning about behaviorally relevant events. Predictive coding theories posit that prediction errors act to signal the difference between internal predictions and actual sensory input, yet most paradigms simultaneously alter both predictions and input, so cannot test for a true difference signal. Increased neural responses to deviants could, instead, encode generalized surprise or augmented bottom-up signaling. Here we compare neural responses to auditory stimuli across oddball paradigm variants. We found that responses of putative excitatory neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) to auditory deviants contain frequency change information and a memory trace of contextual information. Interestingly, in a fixed-deviant oddball paradigm where predictions are altered but deviant input remains constant, neural response patterns encoded standard-to-deviant frequency difference. These results support the interpretation that A1 deviance detection can be interpreted as a sensory prediction error that represents the difference between prediction and sensory input, a corollary of the predictive coding framework.",

      "title": "Microglial Lag3 Drives \u03b1-Synuclein--induced Neurotoxic Activated (A1) Astrocytes and Neurodegeneration",
      "content": "Background Neuroinflammation and pathologic -synuclein (-syn) aggregation cooperate to drive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, but the glial receptors that couple extracellular -syn to inflammatory cascades remain incompletely defined. Microglia express higher levels of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) than neurons, yet the contribution of microglial Lag3 to -syn recognition, glial crosstalk, and neurodegeneration is unknown. Methods Biochemical binding assays, live-cell imaging, cytokine profiling, and neuron-microglia-astrocyte co-culture paradigms were used to define Lag3-dependent -syn preformed fibril (PFF) binding, uptake, and microglial activation. To interrogate in vivo function, microglia-specific Lag3 conditional knockout mice (Lag3L/L-Cx3cr1CreER) and littermate controls received unilateral intrastriatal -syn PFF injections, followed by histological, biochemical, and behavioral assessments of -syn pathology, gliosis, nigrostriatal integrity, and motor performance. Results -syn PFFs bound microglial Lag3 with high specificity and nanomolar affinity and required Lag3 for efficient fibril internalization and induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Microglial Lag3 deficiency markedly blunted -syn PFF-evoked microglial activation, prevented cytokine-driven conversion of astrocytes into neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocytes, and abolished astrocyte-dependent neuronal death in vitro. In vivo, microglia-specific Lag3 deletion reduced cortical, striatal, and substantia nigra pS129 -syn pathology, suppressed microgliosis and A1 astrocyte induction, preserved substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine transporter/tyrosine hydroxylase expression, and ameliorated -syn PFF-induced motor deficits. Conclusions This study identifies microglial Lag3 as a key receptor linking extracellular -syn PFF recognition to inflammatory amplification, neurotoxic reactive A1 astrocyte conversion, and dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Together with prior work on neuronal Lag3, these findings support a cell-type-specific dual-axis model in which neuronal Lag3 mediates -syn propagation while microglial Lag3 drives glia-dependent neurotoxicity, positioning Lag3 as a promising precision therapeutic target in -synucleinopathies.",

      "title": "Disrupted maternal care alters neural-microglia interactions in the primate paralaminar (PL) nucleus of the amygdala.",
      "content": "Prolonged postnatal maturation of the primate amygdala is thought to be driven, at least partially, by continued neural maturation within the paralaminar nucleus (PL). At birth, the PL is densely populated with post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons that gradually mature throughout postnatal life. This active process is likely supported by microglia, which promotes synaptic maturation. Our previous work showed that early life stress associated with maternal separation alters microglia development across the infant to adolescent transition. Here, we examined whether these morphologic microglial changes are associated with alterations in the numbers of pre-synaptic terminals (SYN1+ puncta), post-synaptic terminals (PSD95+ puncta), and putative excitatory contacts (SYN1-PSD95 colocalization), and whether these synaptic elements are engulfed by phagocytic microglia. In maternally reared animals, SYN1+ puncta, PSD95+ puncta, and putative synaptic contacts decreased, while microglial (IBA1+) volume, CD68+ content, and engulfment of synaptic elements increased, between infancy and adolescence. These findings suggest greater pruning of all synaptic elements by adolescence. Maternal separation altered this trajectory, resulting in increased phagocytic activity and engulfment of synaptic elements in infancy, but not in adolescence. Maternal separation also resulted in a 50% reduction in mature PL neurons by adolescence, suggesting maturational failure, cell loss, or both by adolescence. These findings demonstrate that early life stress disrupts normative synaptic pruning and microglia-synapse interactions in the developing primate PL. Increased synaptic engulfment in infants with disrupted care is associated with premature, aberrant pruning, and highlights a potential cellular mechanism through which early environmental insults could change PL neural development by adolescence.",
