      "title": "Cold sensing by a glutamate receptor drives avoidance behavior in Drosophila larvae",
      "content": "The ability to sense and avoid noxious environments is essential for animal survival; yet, how this is achieved at the behavioral, neuronal, and molecular levels is not well understood. Here, we use Drosophila larvae as a model to investigate how animals sense and avoid cold temperatures. By implementing custom-built thermoelectric devices capable of delivering rapid and precise thermal stimuli, we find that cold delivered to the larval head evokes robust escape behavioral responses. We identify a group of head-located cold-sensitive neurons as necessary and sufficient for such avoidance responses. We further demonstrate that the kainate-type glutamate receptor Clumsy acts as a novel cold sensor required for head cold sensitivity. Knockdown of Clumsy in head cold-sensing neurons suppresses their cold sensitivity. Heterologous expression of Clumsy confers cold sensitivity. Our results show that Drosophila larvae have evolved the capacity to detect and avoid cold temperatures through a previously uncharacterized cold-sensing mechanism.",

      "title": "Effective computations for hippocampal place cell phenomena in sparse untrained random networks",
      "content": "The mammalian brain processes experience-dependent spatial information through poorly-understood network mechanisms thought to depend on particular network connectivity patterns and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, dedicated input connections that learn to shape information about place cannot easily explain many rodent hippocampal place cell phenomena. For example, representational drift notwithstanding, the discharge of each place cell maps to specific locations in a fixed environment, but the discharge of most cells remap to distinct independent locations across environments, despite the fact that most sub-second cofiring relationships amongst hippocampal neuron pairs persist across environments. Whereas some models of hippocampal spatial information processing rely on the dedicated input connections of a for-purpose connectome (ignoring remapping, representational drift, and maintained cofiring), other models use synaptic plasticity implemented by learning rules to alter random input connections, but struggle with either limited capacity, representational drift, and/or biological implausibility. Here, using a randomly tuned network with feedback inhibition, we examine whether the assumptions of a specific connectome and learning-implemented synaptic plasticity are necessary for diverse place cell phenomena. We find that the random network with non-plastic connections accounts for positional tuning, single place fields in small spaces and multiple place fields in large spaces, mixed selectivity, and remapping, amongst other place cell phenomena. This requires excitatory activity to be sparse and organized across stimuli by divisive normalization. Enabling synaptic plasticity only at the network connections (not at network inputs) accounts for additional place cell phenomena including overdispersion, representational drift, and memory tagging. We show by simulations and analytically that DivSparse, a random network with sparsifying inhibition can explain many features of place cell network activity, suggesting that simple biologically-plausible architectures can realize representations of spatial experience that are robust, flexible, and spontaneous.",

      "content": "Histamine was the first canonical monoamine identified in the mammalian brain 1-6, yet arguably remains the least understood in its mechanistic contributions to human behaviour. Using a first-in-class causal probe (H3R inverse agonist pitolisant), we show how increased synaptic histamine shapes offline and online temporal-hippocampal dynamics, sustaining learning-related activity and polarising retrieval computations. At a broader level, elevated histamine adaptively shifts neurocomputational strategy under high cognitive load, while stabilising value updates during aversive reinforcement learning. These findings uncover a mechanistically grounded influence of this underexplored system on human neurocomputation, supporting its therapeutic potential in psychiatry.",

      "title": "A molecular convergence in the triad of Parkinson's disease, depressive disorder and gut health is revealed by the inflammation-miRNA axis",
      "content": "Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder frequently comorbid with non-motor symptoms like depressive disorder (DD) and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Chronic neuroinflammation and disruption of the gut-brain axis are implicated as shared pathological drivers, but the precise molecular mechanisms connecting these conditions remain elusive. We hypothesized that a common microRNA (miRNA)-mediated inflammatory profile underlies this clinical triad, representing a point of pathological convergence. Methods: We analyzed the expression of a panel of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated miRNAs, key inflammatory markers, and glial response in postmortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) from patients with PD, DD, and matched healthy controls. To investigate causality and gut-brain axis involvement, two mouse models were used: (i) PD-associated -synucleinopathy was induced in dorsal raphe serotonin (5-HT) neurons; and (ii) DD-like based on corticosterone (CORT)-induced stress. Mice were assessed for depressive-like behaviors and GI dysmotility, and their brain (medial prefrontal cortex and caudate-putamen) and ileum tissues were analyzed for the same molecular markers. Results: We identified a conserved miRNA pattern in the brains of both PD and DD patients, characterized by the significant downregulation of miR-199a-5p and miR-219a-5p and the upregulation of miR-200a-3p. This dysregulation was strongly associated with a pro-inflammatory state, as evidenced by increased expression of TNF, IFN-{gamma}, and NF{kappa}B1, as well as changes in the glial response. Mice with -synucleinopathy in the 5-HT system exhibited a depression-like phenotype and reduced intestinal motility, accompanied by increased Iba1 and GFAP signal. Comparable effects were observed in mice subjected to CORT-induced stress. Notably, the same pattern of miRNAs and inflammatory cytokines observed in the human brain was replicated in the brain and ileum of DD-PD-like mice, providing direct evidence of a parallel pathological process spanning the gut-brain axis. Conclusion: This study identifies a specific miRNA-inflammatory axis as a common molecular mechanism connecting the pathophysiology of PD, DD, and gut dysfunction. This pattern represents a critical point of convergence that drives a shared, bidirectional inflammatory cascade along the gut-brain axis. Targeting this miRNA triad could provide a new therapeutic approach for addressing the motor, psychiatric, and GI symptoms of these interconnected disorders simultaneously.",

      "title": "Hedonic experiences emerge from an orchestrated balance of synergistic and redundant information processing",
      "content": "Ketamine exerts rapid-acting, pro-hedonic effects, yet its precise mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present behavioral and fMRI data from a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study in 38 healthy participants investigating ketamine's sub-acute effects on multivariate information-processing during music-evoked peak hedonic experiences. Leveraging information-theoretical measures, our findings indicate that hedonic experiences depend on a distinct global (as measured by O-Information) and local (as measured by integrated information) balance between redundant - information shared across nodes - and synergistic - information emerging from joint interactions - processes. As hedonic intensity rises, neural dynamics shift toward greater synergy; with the one exception of a deliberate increase in redundancy particularly for key sensory information to ensure reliable transmission of and access to critical external information for subsequent hedonic processing. In contrast, ketamine's sub-acute pro-hedonic effects arise potentially from enhancing redundant dynamics at rest, boosting the brain's capability to robustly represent and access critical internal information, and thus, fostering an environment optimized to amplify the phenomenological hedonic experience, while simultaneously allowing for more efficient information integration.",

      "title": "Attention Defines the Context for Implicit Sensorimotor Adaptation",
      "content": "<p>The sensorimotor system continuously uses error signals to remain precisely calibrated. We examined how attention influences this automatic and implicit learning process in humans (male and female). Focusing first on spatial attention, we compared conditions in which attention was oriented either toward or away from the visual feedback that defined the error signal. Surprisingly, this manipulation had no effect on the rate of sensorimotor adaptation. Using dual-task methods, we next examined the influence of attentional resources on adaptation. Again, we found no effect of attention, with the rate of adaptation similar under focused and divided attention conditions. However, we found that attention modulates adaptation in an indirect manner: The rate of adaptation was significantly attenuated when the attended stimulus changed from the end of one trial to the start of the next trial. In contrast, similar changes to unattended stimuli had no impact on adaptation. These results suggest that visual attention defines the cues that establish the context for sensorimotor learning.</p>",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
      "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization.

      "title": "An adaptive transformer-based framework for advanced brain activity mapping and intelligent neurotherapeutic decision support",
      "content": "IntroductionIdentification and treatment of neurological disorders depend much on brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision support. Although they are loud, do not remain in one spot, and are rather complex, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are the principal tool used in research of brain function. This work employs an Adaptive Transformer-based technique with improved attention processes to extract temporal and spatial relationships in EEG data, effectively addressing these issues.MethodsFirst processed to eliminate noise and split them into time-series chunks, EEG data are then included into the proposed approach. Channel-wise embeddings and temporal encoding help to depict the data. Then, a transformer design including spatial attention for inter-channel interactions, multi-head self-attention for temporal aspects, and an adaptive attention mask for domain-specific modifications is used. Other openly accessible EEG datasets as well as the TUH EEG Corpus and CHB-MIT were evaluated against the model. Its performance was scored using metrics like accuracy, precision, memory, and F1-score.ResultsThe suggested method was more accurate than standard models like CNNs and LSTMs, with a score of 98.24%. The method was also shown to be able to find minor patterns in EEG data by improving precision and memory. Attention maps showed important areas of time and space, which made them easier to understand and useful in professional settings.DiscussionThe Adaptive Transformer turns out to be a useful tool for neurotherapeutic use of EEG data modeling. The approach provides greater medical assistance and knowledge on the functioning of the brain as well as answers significant issues. Future research might focus on subject-specific modifications and interaction with real-time systems.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in revolutionizing EEG analysis for precision brain imaging and neurotherapeutic decision-making.",

      "content": "IntroductionWrist function impairment is common after stroke and heavily impacts the execution of daily tasks. Robotic therapy, and more specifically wearable exoskeletons, have the potential to boost training dose in context-relevant scenarios, promote voluntary effort through motor intent detection, and mitigate the effect of gravity. Portable exoskeletons are often non-backdrivable and it is challenging to make their control safe, reactive and stable. Admittance control is often used in this case, however, this type of control can become unstable when the supported biological joint stiffens. Variable admittance control adapts its parameters dynamically to allow free motion and stabilize the human-robot interaction.MethodsIn this study, we implemented a variable admittance control scheme on a one degree of freedom wearable wrist exoskeleton. The damping parameter of the admittance scheme is adjusted in real-time to cope with instabilities and varying wrist stiffness. In addition to the admittance control scheme, sEMG- and gravity-based controllers were implemented, characterized and optimized on ten healthy participants and tested on six stroke survivors.ResultsThe results show that (1) the variable admittance control scheme could stabilize the interaction but at the cost of a decrease in transparency, and (2) when coupled with the variable admittance controller the sEMG-based control enhanced wrist functionality of stroke survivors in the most extreme angular positions.DiscussionOur variable admittance control scheme with sEMG- and gravity-based support was most beneficial for patients with higher levels of impairment by improving range of motion and promoting voluntary effort. Future work could combine both controllers to customize and fine tune the stability of the support to a wider range of impairment levels and types.",

      "title": "Imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning for sparse badminton strikes via dynamic trajectory generation",
      "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

      "title": "Approaches for retraining sEMG classifiers for upper-limb prostheses",
      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.
