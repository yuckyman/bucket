      "content": "arXiv:2511.17906v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animation pre-production lays the foundation of an animated film by transforming initial concepts into a coherent blueprint across interdependent stages such as ideation, scripting, design, and storyboarding. While generative AI tools are increasingly adopted in this process, they remain isolated, requiring creators to juggle multiple systems without integrated workflow support. Our formative study with 12 professional creative directors and independent animators revealed key challenges in their current practice: Creators must manually coordinate fragmented outputs, manage large volumes of information, and struggle to maintain continuity and creative control between stages. Based on the insights, we present AnimAgents, a human-multi-agent collaborative system that coordinates complex, multi-stage workflows through a core agent and specialized agents, supported by dedicated boards for the four major stages of pre-production. AnimAgents enables stage-aware orchestration, stage-specific output management, and element-level refinement, providing an end-to-end workflow tailored to professional practice. In a within-subjects summative study with 16 professional creators, AnimAgents significantly outperformed a strong single-agent baseline that equipped with advanced parallel image generation in coordination, consistency, information management, and overall satisfaction (p < .01). A field deployment with 4 creators further demonstrated AnimAgents' effectiveness in real-world projects.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.17756v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Immigrants bring unique cultural backgrounds to their host countries. Subsequent interplay of cultures can lead to either a melting pot, where immigrants adopt the dominant culture of the host country, or a mosaic, where distinct cultural identities coexist. The existing literature primarily focuses on the acculturation of immigrants, specifically the melting pot hypothesis. In contrast, we attempt to identify the antecedents of the mosaic hypothesis or factors that enhance (or diminish) the propensity for cultural retention among immigrants. Based on Facebook advertising data for immigrants from 8 countries residing in the USA, our findings suggest that greater host-native distance is linked to higher online cultural retention, and while origin country context is statistically significant, its impact is generally smaller.",

      "title": "A Dynamic Take on Window Management",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.17516v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: On modern computers with graphical user interfaces, application windows are managed by a window manager, a core component of the desktop environment. Mainstream operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Apple's macOS employ window managers, where users rely on a mouse or trackpad to manually resize, reposition, and switch between overlapping windows. This approach can become inefficient, particularly on smaller screens such as laptops, where frequent window adjustments disrupt workflow and increase task completion time. An alternative paradigm, dynamic window management, automatically arranges application windows into non-overlapping layouts. These systems reduce the need for manual manipulation by providing intelligent placement strategies and support for multiple workspaces. Despite their potential usability benefits, dynamic window managers remain niche, primarily available on Linux systems and rarely enabled by default. This study evaluates the usability of dynamic window managers in comparison to conventional floating window systems. We developed a prototype dynamic window manager that incorporates configurable layouts and workspace management, and we conducted both heuristic evaluation and statistical testing to assess its effectiveness. Our findings indicate that dynamic window managers significantly improve task completion time in multi-window workflows by 37.83%. By combining cognitive heuristics with empirical performance measures, this work highlights the potential of dynamic window management as a viable alternative to traditional floating window systems and contributes evidence-based insights to the broader field of human-computer interaction (HCI).",

      "title": "Embedding Generative AI into Systems Analysis and Design Curriculum: Framework, Case Study, and Cross-Campus Empirical Evidence",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.17515v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Systems analysis students increasingly use Generative AI, yet current pedagogy lacks systematic approaches for teaching responsible AI orchestration that fosters critical thinking whilst meeting educational outcomes. Students risk accepting AI suggestions blindly or uncritically without assessing alignment with user needs or contextual appropriateness. SAGE (Structured AI-Guided Education) addresses this gap by embedding GenAI into curriculum design, training students when to accept, modify, or reject AI contributions. Implementation with 18 student groups across four Australian universities revealed how orchestration skills develop. Most groups (84\\%) moved beyond passive acceptance, showing selective judgment, yet none proactively identified gaps overlooked by both human and AI analysis, indicating a competency ceiling. Students strong at explaining decisions also performed well at integrating sources, and those with deep domain understanding consistently considered accessibility considerations. Accessibility awareness proved fragile. When writing requirements, 85\\% of groups explicitly considered elderly users and cultural needs. Notably, 55\\% of groups struggled identifying when AI misclassified system boundaries (what belongs inside versus outside the system), 45\\% missed data management errors (how information is stored and updated), and 55\\% overlooked missing exception handling. Three implications emerge for educators: (i) require students to document why they accepted, modified, or rejected each AI suggestion, making reasoning explicit; (ii) embed accessibility prompts at each development stage because awareness collapses without continuous scaffolding; and (iii) have students create their own specifications before using AI, then compare versions, and anchor to research or standards to identify gaps.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.17513v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The study explores the effects of motivational climate on communication features, emotional states, collective efficacy, and performance in collaborative gaming environments. Forty participants with no prior gaming experience were randomly assigned to 20 gender-matched teams of three (including one confederate) across two motivational climates: positive-supportive (PS) or neutral-unsupported (NU) (10 teams per condition). Team members completed three progressively difficult levels of Overcooked! 2 during which communication contents, emotional responses, collective efficacy, and performance outcomes were observed and coded. Mixed-design MANOVAs and ANOVAs were employed to examine the effects of motivational climate and task difficulty on communication patterns, emotions, collective efficacy, and performance. Chi-square analyses were performed to test communication content differences between conditions. Results revealed that PS team members significantly outperformed NU teams at lower task difficulty level, but this advantage diminished as task complexity increased. Communication analysis revealed that PS team members utilized significantly more action-oriented, factual, and emotional/motivational statements, while NU team members used more statements of uncertainty and non-task-related communication. The percentage of the talk time increased with difficulty across both climate conditions. PS team members maintained more positive emotional profiles throughout, with higher excitement and happiness scores and lower anxiety, dejection, and anger compared to NU team members. Furthermore, PS team members reported consistently higher collective efficacy beliefs across all difficulty levels. These findings reveal that positive motivational climate enhances team communication effectiveness, emotional resilience, and performance outcomes in challenging collaborative environments.",

Dark patterns and deceptive designs (DPs) have been found in these and other gaming platforms within certain cultural contexts. Here, we explored DPs in the onboarding experiences of free-to-play mobile games from China and Japan. We identified several unique patterns and mapped their relative prevalence. We also found that game developers often employ combinations of DPs as a strategy (\"DP Combos\") and use elements that, while not inherently manipulative, can enhance the impact of known patterns (\"DP Enhancers\"). Guided by these findings, we then developed an enriched ontology for categorizing deceptive game design patterns into classes and subclasses. This research contributes to understanding deceptive game design patterns and offers insights for future studies on cultural dimensions and ethical game design in general.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.17511v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: To accelerate mechanical design and enhance design quality and innovation, we present a Multidisciplinary Design and Optimization (MDO) Agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent semi-automates the end-to-end workflow by orchestrating three core capabilities: (i) natural-language-driven parametric modeling, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for knowledge-grounded conceptualization, and (iii) intelligent orchestration of engineering software for performance verification and optimization. Working in tandem, these capabilities interpret high-level, unstructured intent, translate it into structured design representations, automatically construct parametric 3D CAD models, generate reliable concept variants using external knowledge bases, and conduct evaluation with iterative optimization via tool calls such as finite-element analysis (FEA). Validation on three representative cases - a gas-turbine blade, a machine-tool column, and a fractal heat sink - shows that the agent completes the pipeline from natural-language intent to verified and optimized designs with reduced manual scripting and setup effort, while promoting innovative design exploration. This work points to a practical path toward human-AI collaborative mechanical engineering and lays a foundation for more dependable, vertically customized MDO systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.17509v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human-AI collaboration outcomes depend strongly on human self-confidence calibration, which drives reliance or resistance toward AI's suggestions. This work presents two studies examining whether calibration of self-confidence before decision tasks, low versus high levels of Need for Cognition (NFC), and Actively Open-Minded Thinking (AOT), leads to differences in decision accuracy, self-confidence appropriateness during the tasks, and metacognitive perceptions (global and affective). The first study presents strategies to identify well-calibrated users, also comparing decision accuracy and the appropriateness of self-confidence across NFC and AOT levels. The second study investigates the effects of calibrated self-confidence in AI-assisted decision-making (no AI, two-stage AI, and personalized AI), also considering different NFC and AOT levels. Our results show the importance of human self-confidence calibration and psychological traits when designing AI-assisted decision systems. We further propose design recommendations to address the challenge of calibrating self-confidence and supporting tailored, user-centric AI that accounts for individual traits.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.17508v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Augmented Reality (AR) applications often require robust real-time tracking of objects in the user's environment to correctly overlay virtual content. Recent advances in computer vision have produced highly accurate deep learning-based object trackers, but these models are typically too heavy in computation and memory for wearable AR devices. In this paper, we present a lightweight RGB object tracking algorithm designed specifically for resource-constrained AR platforms. The proposed tracker employs a compact Siamese neural network architecture and incorporates optimization techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation to drastically reduce model size and inference cost while maintaining high tracking accuracy. We train the tracker offline on large video datasets using deep convolutional neural networks and then deploy it on-device for real-time tracking. Experimental results on standard tracking benchmarks show that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art trackers, yet runs in real-time on a mobile AR headset at around 30 FPS -- more than an order of magnitude faster than prior high-performance trackers on the same hardware. This work enables practical, robust object tracking for AR use-cases, opening the door to more interactive and dynamic AR experiences on lightweight devices.",

Indeed, the machine, now equipped with artificial intelligences requiring new appropriations and enabling new mediations, constitutes new challenges for artists. To study these confrontations and new mediations, our approach mobilizes the theoretical framework of the Human-AI Musicking Framework, based on a lexicometric analysis of content. The aim is to clarify the present and future uses of AI from the interfaces, in the creation of sound and musical content, and to identify the obstacles, obstacles, brakes and limits to appropriation ``in the fact of making the content one's own and integrating it as a part of oneself'' (Bachimont and Crozat, 2004) in the context of a collaboration between musician and machine.",

      "content": "arXiv:2409.17516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.11480v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.",

      "content": "arXiv:2404.01250v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Visual neural decoding from EEG has improved significantly due to diffusion models that can reconstruct high-quality images from decoded latents. While recent works have focused on relatively complex architectures to achieve good reconstruction performance from EEG, less attention has been paid to the source of this information. We present a unified framework that not only enables image reconstruction from EEG using a simple linear decoder, but also isolates interpretable EEG feature maps that support visual perception. Unlike prior approaches that rely on deep, opaque models, our method leverages the inherent structure of CLIP embeddings to keep the mapping linear. We show that training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Beyond reconstruction, Perceptogram enables the visualization of presumptive electrode preference and EEG patterns, revealing interpretable EEG feature maps that correspond to distinct visual attributes, such as semantic class, texture, and hue. We thus use our framework, Perceptogram, to probe EEG signals at various levels of the visual information hierarchy.",

      "title": "Robust Core-Periphery Constrained Transformer for Domain Adaptation",
      "content": "arXiv:2308.13515v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn transferable representation across domains. Recently a few UDA works have successfully applied Transformer-based methods and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. However, it remains challenging when there exists a large domain gap between the source and target domain. Inspired by humans' exceptional transferability abilities to adapt knowledge from familiar to uncharted domains, we try to apply the universally existing organizational structure in the human functional brain networks, i.e., the core-periphery principle to design the Transformer and improve its UDA performance. In this paper, we propose a novel brain-inspired robust core-periphery constrained transformer (RCCT) for unsupervised domain adaptation, which brings a large margin of performance improvement on various datasets. Specifically, in RCCT, the self-attention operation across image patches is rescheduled by an adaptively learned weighted graph with the Core-Periphery structure (CP graph), where the information communication and exchange between images patches are manipulated and controlled by the connection strength, i.e., edge weight of the learned weighted CP graph. Besides, since the data in domain adaptation tasks can be noisy, to improve the model robustness, we intentionally add perturbations to the patches in the latent space to ensure generating robust learned weighted core-periphery graphs. Extensive evaluations are conducted on several widely tested UDA benchmarks. Our proposed RCCT consistently performs best compared to existing works, including 88.3\\% on Office-Home, 95.0\\% on Office-31, 90.7\\% on VisDA-2017, and 46.0\\% on DomainNet.",

Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \\textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.18853v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.18325v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, reorganise large-scale brain connectivity, yet how these changes are reflected across electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) and haemodynamic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) networks remains unclear. We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.",

Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.\n  Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.\n  Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration.
