      "title": "The Otter and the Cleaver: Exploring the Neural Underpinnings of Unitization Using the Gestalt Principle of Proximity",
      "content": "Associative memory requires the binding of multiple objects into a single representation in memory. As such, associative memory is viewed as harder and more resource-demanding than item memory. One means of facilitating associative memory is through the process of unitization. Previous work has suggested that, once unitized, discrete stimuli are processed as a single ensemble. The present study aims to test whether the grouping principle of proximity enhances associative memory by creating unitized representations of item pairs that resemble how single items are processed in memory in younger adults. To examine the neural basis of perceptual unitization, young adult participants encoded unrelated object pairs either proximally arranged (unitized condition) or distally arranged (associative condition) as well as single objects. Behaviorally, results showed enhanced memory for proximally organized object pairs compared with distally organized object pairs. Examination of neural pattern similarity across conditions suggested that although regions critical to associative memory processed the proximal object pairs more similarly to the distal object pairs, clusters of neural activity throughout cortex did show greater similarity of neural patterns across proximal pairs and single objects during both encoding and retrieval. Results suggest that the simple act of configural placement is enough to initiate unitized-based encoding and maintain that representation at retrieval.",

      "title": "AKAP1 regulates mitochondrial and synaptic homeostasis to enable neuroprotection and repair in retinal ganglion cell degeneration",
      "content": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve degeneration. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in this neurodegeneration, yet effective targeted therapies remain limited. Here, we identify the mitochondrial scaffold A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1) as a critical regulator of RGC resilience and axon regeneration. AKAP1 expression is diminished in human glaucomatous retinas and experimental glaucoma models, correlating with elevated intraocular pressure, disrupted mitochondrial dynamics, oxidative stress, and synaptic instability. Restoration of AKAP1 via adeno-associated virus serotype 2-mediated gene therapy preserves RGC survival, promotes mitochondrial fusion and cristae integrity, enhances ATP production, and mitigates oxidative and apoptotic stress in mouse models of glaucoma and optic nerve injury. Transcriptomic profiling of AKAP1 knockout retinas reveals widespread dysregulation of mitochondrial and synaptic gene networks. Mechanistically, AKAP1 stabilizes synapses by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, modulating calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II and synapsin phosphorylation, maintaining synaptophysin expression, and suppressing complement component C1q expression, thereby preventing early synaptic loss in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Moreover, restoring AKAP1 expression facilitates axonal regeneration, preserves the central visual pathway, and maintains visual function. Collectively, these findings establish AKAP1 as a master regulator of mitochondrial and synaptic homeostasis and axonal regeneration and a promising therapeutic target for vision preservation in glaucomatous neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "Muscle-specific DNM2 overexpression improves Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in vivo and reveals a narrow therapeutic window in skeletal muscle",
      "content": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) caused by dominant loss-of-function mutations in DNM2, encoding the GTPase dynamin-2, impairs motor and sensory function. However, the respective contributions of muscle and nerve pathology, and the therapeutic potential of increasing DNM2 expression, remain unresolved. We evaluated tissue-targeted and systemic approaches to increase DNM2 in a mouse model carrying the common K562E-CMT mutation. Muscle-specific DNM2 overexpression from embryogenesis in Dnm2K562E/+ mice ameliorated desmin and integrin mislocalization, membrane trafficking defects, mitochondrial abnormalities, and fibrosis in skeletal muscle, resulting in improved locomotor performance despite persistent muscle atrophy. Conversely, systemic postnatal AAV delivery of human DNM2 increased DNM2 in muscle but failed to transduce nerves, and paradoxically worsened the muscle pathology, producing centronuclear myopathy-like features. These findings reveal a primary pathogenic impact of DNM2-CMT mutation within skeletal muscle, independent of nerve involvement. Collectively, they underscore that precise DNM2 dosage is critical for neuromuscular homeostasis and reveal a narrow therapeutic window for safe and effective therapeutic intervention. This paradox, in which efforts to compensate for a loss-of-function neuropathy risk inducing a gain-of-function myopathy, highlights the need for tightly controlled modulation of DNM2 activity in future therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Ataxin-2 knockdown is neuroprotective via cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms",
      "content": "Ataxin-2 (Atxn2), a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein, has been implicated in ALS risk, and its silencing represents a promising therapeutic strategy to extend life span and ameliorate symptoms in ALS. Although neuroprotective effects have been shown in several ALS preclinical models, the molecular mechanisms underlying ataxin-2 downregulation neuroprotective effects remain poorly understood. Starting with a global proteomic profiling of the yeast and mouse TDP-43 models, we uncovered that pbp1/ataxin-2 downregulation rewires metabolism to activate alternative cellular pathways for energy production under stress. By combining proteomic profiling insights and functional studies in neural cultures, we further show that ataxin-2 downregulation adjusts metabolism in both cell-autonomous and non cell-autonomous pathways. In neurons, ataxin-2 downregulation activates glycolysis and reductive glutamine carboxylation, while astrocytes provide enhanced support by increasing cholesterol synthesis. Collectively, our data characterize novel cellular pathways to overcome TDP-43 toxicity and establish ataxin-2 as a regulator of adaptive response in brain cells under the conditions of stress.",

      "content": "Osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS), which embraces central pontine myelinolysis and extrapontine myelinolysis, is a well-known but uncommon disorder of the central nervous system. The disease primarily occurs after rapid correction of severe hyponatremia. However, excessive drinking is one of the rare etiologies of ODS. Cases of alcohol-related ODS without documented hyponatremia are rarely reported, and optimal therapeutic approaches remain unclear. We report a patient in his 30\u2019s with a history of heavy drinking who presented with unsteady gait and limb tremor as the main clinical manifestations. The patient consistently denied any history of fluid or electrolyte imbalances and reported a normal-range blood sodium level. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed triangular T2-weighted and FLAIR pontine hyperintensity with a surrounding DWI rim. Finally, the patient recovered completely following corticosteroid treatment. This case shows the possibility that Alcohol-related ODS can occur without electrolyte disturbances and may respond favorably to combined corticosteroid and vitamin B therapy, warranting further investigation in clinical studies. We conducted a literature review of ODS in alcoholic patients and summarized its possible etiology, epidemiology, clinical characteristics and treatment options to raise awareness of such disorders.",

      "content": "IntroductionPersons with aphasia (PWA) experience changes to feedback and feedforward speech motor control, though the impact on these subsystems has not yet been explored using different perturbation schedules. Here, we examine the magnitude of auditory-motor adaptive and corrective responses together in PWA using gradually and suddenly applied perturbation schedules.MethodsNine PWA and 12 neurotypical adults of similar age to the PWA (NT) completed gradual and sudden altered auditory feedback (AAF) paradigms to measure adaptive and corrective responses to formant perturbation (formants of/\u03b5/shifted toward formants of/\u00e6/). As a measure of the feedforward system, we calculated adaptive responses using the formant changes in the first 100 ms of production. As a measure of the feedback system, we calculated corrective responses based on the differences between the later portion of the production (200\u2013300 ms) and the early portion of the vowel (0\u2013100 ms). Our analyses revealed significant interactions between group and perturbation schedule.ResultsAdaptive and corrective responses of PWA were more similar to those of the NT group in the sudden perturbation schedule. Single-case comparisons of each PWA to the NT group identified different impairment patterns in adaptive and corrective responses during gradual and sudden AAF paradigms within PWA.DiscussionThese findings suggest that measuring adaptive and corrective responses using an adaptation paradigm in PWA is both viable and informative, as the PWA exhibited different impairments in adaptive and corrective responses across the two perturbation schedules. Outcome differences in response to sudden versus gradual perturbations for the PWA may be explained by difficulties with the detection of auditory errors during speech. Perhaps a sudden perturbation schedule improves the adaptive and corrective abilities of PWA by increasing their agency over their speech errors. More studies are needed to further elucidate the critical mechanisms of auditory-motor adaptive and corrective responses in PWA.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> : Farmore is a comprehensive CLI tool written in Python designed to create full backups of GitHub repositories. While <code>git clone</code> is great for source code, it misses a lot of the project management data. Farmore automates the process of:</p> <ul> <li>Cloning or updating repositories.</li> <li>Exporting Issues (preserving the history of bugs and feature requests).</li> <li>Downloading compiled Releases/binaries.</li> <li>Backing up Wikis. It uses concurrency to handle multiple repositories simultaneously, making it much faster than running a sequential script.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Target Audience :</strong> This tool is for developers, data archivists, and &quot;self-hosters&quot; who rely on GitHub but want to ensure they own their data. If you are worried about losing access to your account, or if you just want an offline copy of your project's issues and documentation, this is for you. It is suitable for production use as a daily backup cron job.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> : The main alternative is running a standard <code>git clone --mirror</code>. However, standard Git commands <strong>do not</strong> download Issues, Releases, or Wiki data\u2014they only download the version control history. There are other specific tools that download <em>only</em> issues or <em>only</em> repos, but Farmore aims to be an all-in-one solution that handles the full scope of repository data concurrently. It simplifies the backup process into a single command rather than needing multiple scripts.</p> <p><strong>Source Code</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/miztizm/farmore\">https://github.com/miztizm/farmore</a></p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback on the structure or if there are other data points I should add to the backup process!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lanbird\"> /u/lanbird </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p7b7cr/i_made_farmore_a_python_cli_to_backup_github/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p7b7cr/i_made_farmore_a_python_cli_to_backup_github/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation, a non-invasive spinal cord neuromodulation method holds tremendous promise and hope to restore functions in individuals with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury (SCI), cerebral palsy, stroke and other neurological conditions. Yet, there are relatively few options for such stimulation devices compared to conventional stimulators commonly used for neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and functional electrical stimulation, particularly for people with neurological conditions in the developing countries. Approach. In this report, we present OpenXstim, an open-source, two-channel programmable electrical stimulator developed to advance research in non-invasive muscle, nerve, or spinal cord stimulation treatments. Main results. OpenXstim can deliver current pulses up to 110 mA with a compliance voltage of 96 V per channel. In benchtop testing, we found that the stimulator successfully generates high frequency (9 kHz) burst stimulation, a mode commonly used for spinal cord neuromodulation. The stimulator was further tested in two individuals with SCI and showed preliminary indications of functional improvement. However, large controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy. Although special care was taken in the design of the stimulator to ensure user safety, users are strongly warned to handle the device with utmost caution, as it can generate high voltage and current that may cause adverse health effects if not used properly. Significance. This programmable, open-source stimulator offers tangible hope for improving the accessibility of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments for people with paralysis worldwide. The design and complete source-code of the stimulator are freely available online in a public repository: https://github.com/OpenMedTech-Lab/OpenXstim",

      "title": "Spectral brain connectivity in dementia: coherence, imaginary coherence and partial coherence analysis of EEG signals",
      "content": "Objective. As the prevalence of dementia continues to rise, the need for accurate and early diagnostic tools becomes increasingly critical. Despite diverse underlying causes, dementia types share common cognitive symptoms, making accurate diagnosis essential for effective treatment. Approach: This study investigates electroencephalographic (EEG)-based spectral brain connectivity in individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD, ), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, ), and healthy controls (HCs, ), with the dual aim of identifying condition-specific connectivity patterns and evaluating three coherence-based connectivity measures: coherence, imaginary coherence, and partial coherence. Resting-state, eyes-closed EEG data (19 channels) were analyzed, and connectivity was estimated across frequencies to assess both global and local network alterations. Main results. The results indicate that dementias (both AD and FTD) are characterized by decreased connectivity in higher frequency bands and increased connectivity in lower frequencies, reflecting respectively impaired neural communication and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the severity of cognitive impairment correlates with the spatial extent and magnitude of connectivity disruptions. Notably, partial coherence\u2014unlike coherence and imaginary coherence\u2014effectively distinguishes between the AD and FTD groups, suggesting that direct connectivity measures may provide more discriminative information for differential diagnosis. Significance. These findings highlight the potential of EEG-based spectral connectivity analysis, particularly partial coherence, as a non-invasive tool to aid in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes, supporting early clinical decision-making.",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.
