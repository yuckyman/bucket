      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "content": "Study objectives: Sleep loss significantly disrupts cognitive and emotional functioning, yet the neural consequences of different types of sleep deprivation remain unclear. Methods: In a within-subject resting-state fMRI study, we examined how acute total sleep deprivation (TSD) and chronic sleep restriction (CSR) alter intrinsic functional brain organization in 28 healthy adults scanned under three conditions: rested wakefulness (RW), after one night of TSD, and after five nights of CSR. To quantify network-level disruption, we applied graph-theoretical analyses, including a novel within-subject adaptation of the Hub Disruption Index and Covariate-Constrained Manifold Learning (CCML), an unsupervised embedding technique sensitive to subject-level covariates. Moreover, we assessed subjective sleep quality, sleepiness, and circadian traits. Results: Both TSD and CSR were associated with a consistent reorganization of graph topology relative to RW. Furthermore, direct comparisons revealed that TSD and CSR affect different brain hubs. Regional changes in degree, closeness, and clustering coefficients were most prominent in subsystems of the default mode network, frontoparietal network, and cerebellum. These differences were also captured in CCML embeddings, supporting the hypothesis that acute and chronic sleep deprivation exert divergent effects on brain connectivity. Findings were robust across graph thresholds, brain atlases, and nodal metrics. Moreover, these results were further supported by the subjective measures - sleepiness was associated with reduced network integration in RW, and circadian phenotype emerged as a key determinant of individual sensitivity to sleep loss. Conclusions: Our results show that TSD and CSR induce distinct alterations in brain functional organization, offering new insights into their neural impact.",

We found that cytokines of the IL-1 superfamily (IL-1, IL-18, IL-1RA) and IL-6 were most consistently associated with neuroinflammation, brain injury and poor clinical outcomes. Spearman correlation analysis revealed positive associations between CSF concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-18, and IL-10 and serum concentrations of IL-1RA and IL-6 with the astrocytic marker, Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Levels of CSF IL-1RA and IL-18 were associated with increased volume of cerebral oedema on MRI and were significantly raised (p < 0.05) in both patients with abnormal GCS scores (< 15) and worse outcomes (LoS <3). Moreover, the blood levels of these key mediators were unaffected by adjunctive dexamethasone treatment. Taken together, this work identified key targets for direct, targeted adjunctive anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective therapy to be taken forward in clinical trials, aiming to improve outcomes following HSE.",

      "title": "Transcriptional regulation of disease-relevant microglial activation programs",
      "content": "Microglia, the brain's innate immune cells, can adopt a wide variety of activation states relevant to health and disease. Dysregulation of microglial activation occurs in numerous brain disorders, and driving or inhibiting specific states could be therapeutic. To discover regulators of microglial activation states, we conducted CRISPR interference screens in iPSC-derived microglia for inhibitors and activators of six microglial states. We identified transcriptional regulators for each of these states and characterized 31 regulators at the single-cell transcriptomic and cell-surface proteome level in two distinct iPSC-derived microglia models. Finally, we functionally characterized several regulators. STAT2 knockdown inhibits interferon response and lysosomal function. PRDM1 knockdown drives disease-associated and lipid-rich signatures and enhanced phagocytosis. DNMT1 knockdown results in widespread loss of methylation, activating negative regulators of interferon signaling. These findings provide a framework to direct microglial activation to selectively enrich microglial activation states, define their functional outputs, and inform future therapies.",

      "title": "Tachykinin 1-expressing neurons in the lateral habenula signal negative reward prediction error",
      "content": "Evaluating outcomes to accurately predict which actions lead to reward is crucial for survival. Discrepancies between expected and realized outcomes, termed reward prediction errors, serve as a teaching signal to update subsequent predictions and promote adaptive behavior. Neural correlates of prediction errors have been identified in several brain regions, including the lateral habenula (LHb), which contains a subpopulation of neurons encoding negative RPEs (nRPEs) that are excited by worse-than-expected outcomes and inhibited by better-than-expected outcomes. LHb projections to the midbrain shape firing in dopaminergic neurons and play a well-established role in reward learning and decision-making. However, the LHb engages in a wide variety of behaviors beyond reward processing, and it remains unclear whether these distinct functions are mediated by specific transcriptionally defined cell types. Little is known about the transcriptomic identity of nRPE-encoding neurons, limiting our understanding of the specific role of these signals in outcome valuation. Using cell type-specific recording in mice performing reward-guided tasks, we demonstrate neurons expressing the neuropeptide gene Tachykinin-1 (Tac1) represent a subpopulation of LHb neurons encoding reward prediction errors. We found LHbTac1 reward outcome responses are sensitive to changes in both the expected value and realized value of rewards, and their activity scales with the magnitude of the difference. Further, LHbTac1 neurons show little modulation to other task-related events, or to innately aversive stimuli that engage a broader population of LHb cell types. Together, these data demonstrate that Tac1 marks a subpopulation of LHb neurons that preferentially encodes nRPE. Our results provide insight into cell type-specific contributions of habenular neurons in RPE signaling and open avenues for more targeted manipulations of nRPE-encoding neurons to understand their role in reward-guided behavior.",
