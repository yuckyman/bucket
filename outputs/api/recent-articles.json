The code you write closely resembles standard python code with some structural conventions added to automatically unlock these abilities. There\u2019s too much to describe in just this post, so I ask that you check out the comprehensive README for a thorough description and explanation of all the features that I described above.</p> <p>Darl only has python standard library dependencies. This library was not vibe-coded, every line and feature was thoughtfully considered and built on top a decade of experience in the quantitative modeling field. Darl is MIT licensed.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong></p> <p>The motivating use case for this library is computational modeling, so mainly data scientists/analysts/engineers, however the abilities provided by this library are broadly applicable across many different disciplines.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>The closest libraries to darl in look feel and functionality are fn_graph (unmaintained) and Apache Hamilton (recently picked up by the apache foundation). However, darl offers several conveniences and capabilities over both, more of which are covered in the &quot;Alternatives&quot; section of the README.</p> <p><strong>Quick Demo</strong></p> <p>Here is a quick working snippet. This snippet on it's own doesn't describe much in terms of features (check our the README for that), it serves only to show the similarities between darl code and standard python code, however, these minor differences unlock powerful capabilities.</p> <pre><code>from darl import Engine def Prediction(ngn, region): model = ngn.FittedModel(region) data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() return model + data def FittedModel(ngn, region): data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() adj = {'East': 0, 'West': 1}[region] return data + 1 + adj def Data(ngn): return 1 ngn = Engine.create([Prediction, FittedModel, Data]) ngn.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 4 def FittedRandomForestModel(ngn, region): data = ngn.Data() ngn.collect() return data + 99 ngn2 = ngn.update({'FittedModel': FittedRandomForestModel}) ngn2.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 101 # call to `Data` pulled from cache since not affected ngn.Prediction('West') # -&gt; 4 # Pulled from cache, not rerun ngn.trace().from_cache # -&gt; True </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Bar1754\"> /u/Global_Bar1754 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmn6rs/darl_incremental_compute_scenario_analysis/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmn6rs/darl_incremental_compute_scenario_analysis/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I wanted to share a CLI tool I built to solve a personal headache: organizing folders full of unnamed music files (like `01 Audio Track.m4a`).</p> <p>**Repository &amp; Download:** <a href=\"https://github.com/jlfernandes22/Music-Renamer-CLI\">https://github.com/jlfernandes22/Music-Renamer-CLI</a></p> <p>### What My Project Does</p> <p>Music Renamer CLI automatically identifies and renames music files in a directory. It uses `ffmpeg` to capture a snippet of the audio and sends it to Shazam (via the `shazamio` library) to fetch metadata. It then renames the file to `Artist - Title.ext`.</p> <p>It is specifically optimized for Windows users:</p> <p>* It comes compiled as a standalone `.exe` (so non-coders don't need Python installed).</p> <p>* It includes a patch for SSL certificate errors (`aiohttp` often fails on older/corporate Windows machines due to missing certs).</p> <p>* It preserves the original file extension (.mp3, .wav, .m4a, etc.).</p> <p>### Target Audience</p> <p>This tool is for **music hoarders** or anyone with a messy &quot;Downloads&quot; folder who wants a &quot;set it and forget it&quot; solution. It is meant for production use on personal collections. It is particularly useful for Windows users who struggle with Python environment setups, as I focused heavily on the PyInstaller build process to bundle dependencies correctly.</p> <p>I created this tool because I personally struggled using MusicBrainz Picard to recognize some old songs I had on a disc, and I needed something simpler that just worked based on audio fingerprinting.</p> <p>### Comparison</p> <p>* **Vs MusicBrainz Picard:** Picard is the gold standard but is a heavy GUI application that requires manual interaction and clustering. My tool is a lightweight CLI designed for quick, automated &quot;fire and forget&quot; renaming based on audio fingerprinting rather than existing metadata.</p> <p>* **Vs Standard Shazam:** Standard Shazam identifies one song at a time manually. This tool handles batch processing of entire folders.</p> <p>* **Vs AudioTag:** This runs locally (mostly) and doesn't require uploading full files to a web service, only the fingerprint is sent.</p> <p>I'd love to hear your feedback on the code structure or the Windows build approach!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SolidEstablishment70\"> /u/SolidEstablishment70 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmr22w/project_music_renamer_cli_a_standalone_tool_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qmr22w/project_music_renamer_cli_a_standalone_tool_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "A novel intelligent physiotherapy robot based on dynamic acupoint recognition method",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysiotherapy robots offer a feasible and promising solution for achieving safe and efficient treatment. Among these, acupoint recognition is the core component that ensures the precision of physiotherapy robots. Although the research on the acupoint recognition such as hand and ear has been extensive, the accurate location of acupoints on the back of the human body still faces great challenges due to the lack of significant external features.MethodsThis paper designs a two-stage acupoint recognition method, which is achieved through the cooperation of two detection networks. First, a lightweight RTMDet network is used to extract the effective back range from the image, and then the acupoint coordinates are inferred from the extracted back range, reducing the inference consumption caused by invalid information. In addition, the RTMPose network based on the SimCC framework converts the acupoint coordinate regression problem into a classification problem of sub-pixel block subregions on the X and Y axes by performing sub-pixel-level segmentation of images, significantly improving detection speed and accuracy. Meanwhile, the multi-layer feature fusion of CSPNeXt enhances feature extraction capabilities. Then, we designed a physiotherapy interaction interface. Through the three-dimensional coordinates of the acupoints, we independently planned the physiotherapy task path of the physiotherapy robot.ResultsWe conducted performance tests on the acupoint recognition system and physiotherapy task planning in the physiotherapy robot system. The experiments have proven our effectiveness, achieving a recall of 90.17% on human datasets, with a detection error of around 5.78\u202fmm. At the same time, it can accurately identify different back postures and achieve an inference speed of 30 FPS on a 4070Ti GPU. Finally, we conducted continuous physiotherapy tasks on multiple acupoints for the user.ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrate the significant advantages and broad application potential of this method in improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous acupoint recognition by physiotherapy robots.",

      "title": "Reconfiguration of Premotor Excitation and Inhibition Drives Behavior-Specific Protopodium Dynamics in Drosophila Larvae",
      "content": "Animals use the same muscles to generate distinct locomotor behaviors, raising the question of how shared motor systems produce behavior-specific outputs. In Drosophila larvae, forward and backward crawling recruit largely overlapping motor pools but differ in the timing of ventral oblique (VO) muscle activation, which occurs late in forward crawling and early in backward crawling. Although this timing difference has been described, the circuit mechanisms that impose it and its functional significance have remained unclear. Here, we show that VO muscles are primary drivers of protopodium movement, a limb-like structure involved in substrate engagement during crawling, and that their behavior-specific activation timing is controlled by a tri-segmental premotor circuit. Using muscle calcium imaging, optogenetic and connectome-based circuit analysis, and biomechanical modeling, we identify a feedforward inhibitory motif composed of two previously characterized excitatory premotor neurons (A27h and A18b3) and the inhibitory premotor neuron A06c. During forward crawling, A06c exhibits a biphasic activity pattern that defines a narrow temporal window for VO contraction and prevents premature, multi-segmental VO activation. During backward crawling, this premotor configuration is disengaged: A27h and A18b3 are inactive, and the initial inhibitory peak of A06c is absent, permitting earlier VO activation. Disrupting this circuit causes premature VO activation, impaired protopodium folding, compressed intersegmental coordination, and reduced forward crawling efficiency. Together, our findings show how reconfiguration of premotor excitation and inhibition generates behavior-specific muscle dynamics within a shared motor system.",

      "title": "Computational modeling of resistance to hormone-mediated remission in childhood absence epilepsy",
      "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",

      "title": "How the olfactory bulb maintains stable odor manifolds amid adaptation and representational drift",
      "content": "Adaptive coding in sensory circuits enables stable perception while accommodating experience-dependent changes. In the olfactory bulb (OB), repeated odor exposure reshapes population activity even without explicit behavioral feedback, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unclear. By analyzing longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging datasets from the mouse OB, we identified three concurrent forms of representational change: gain adaptation, similarity-dependent pattern separation or convergence, and a rotation of encoding subspace resulting in the representational drift. Using a computational model of the mitral cell-granule cell circuit, we showed that Hebbian plasticity and structural connectivity constraints are sufficient to reproduce these transformations. Despite global representational drift, the relative geometry of odor response vectors remained stable, preserving a low-dimensional odor manifold. Together, our results reveal how local plasticity and network structure jointly enable both stability and flexibility in early sensory coding.",
