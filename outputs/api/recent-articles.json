      "title": "A computational framework combining neuronal dynamics and evolutionary game theory for network-level synaptic interactions",
      "content": "Objective. In this study, we present a novel computational framework that combines the Hindmarsh\u2013Rose (HR) neuronal model with evolutionary game theory on networks to simulate and interpret synaptic-level interactions within neuronal populations. Our approach preserves the features of the HR model\u2014capable of generating both spiking and bursting dynamics\u2014while integrating game-theoretic principles that govern the balance between emulative and non-emulative behaviors across neurons. Approach. Neurons were modeled as strategic agents whose interactions evolve according to game-theoretic principles, allowing us to capture emergent network dynamics beyond classical electrophysiological analyses. A key innovation of our work is the formulation of a parameter estimation method based on adaptive observers, which enables the recovery of game-theoretic parameters solely from partial state observations. The proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to recover hidden parameters and accurately predict system behavior under diverse conditions. Main results. By applying the devised approach to synthetic datasets mimicking real electrophysiological recordings, we highlight its applicability in distinguishing neuronal populations based on their strategic interactions. In this context, the model is shown to faithfully reproduce both spiking and bursting behaviors, capturing the diverse electrophysiological patterns observed in in vitro experimental settings. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this model in experimental data analysis by suggesting that the estimated parameters may serve as discriminative markers for different neuronal types and structural characteristics. Significance. The integration of dynamical systems theory, game-theoretic modeling, and adaptive estimation provides a robust quantitative tool for investigating complex neuronal network dynamics. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of the method in parameter estimation, reinforcing its value for systematic analysis of synaptic interactions and advancing our understanding of neuronal network dynamics.",

      "title": "Patient-specific long-term seizure prediction via multi-model classification",
      "content": "Objective. Most existing seizure prediction approaches rely on cohort-based models or assume a single model suffices per patient, overlooking clinical and electrophysiological variability across seizures. This study aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a subject-specific seizure prediction framework that models intra-subject heterogeneity by identifying and clustering seizure-specific preictal patterns using long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected over a one to two week duration. Approach: Absolute, relative, and ratio power spectral density features are extracted from twelve frequency bands, and the minimum uncertainty and sample elimination algorithm is used for unsupervised feature selection on a per-seizure basis. Weighted aggregation is then applied to form seizure-specific feature sets. Seizures are grouped into clusters based on feature similarity, and separate classifiers are trained for each cluster. Model predictions are combined using a grid optimized k-of-N voting strategy. Evaluation is conducted on long-term iEEG recordings from ten patients using cross-validation across seizure-containing sessions. Main results. When clustering is applied, the mean sensitivity across subjects is improved from 89.17% to 98.54%, while the mean FPR is reduced from 1.15/day to 0.62/day. Additionally, the median number of features required per subject decreased from 22 to 14, reflecting a 36.4% reduction in model complexity. Finally, in 72.5% of subject-folds, the number of algorithm-identified clusters equaled or exceeded the clinically annotated seizure types, with a linear trend indicating latent electrophysiological variability beyond clinical labels. Significance. These findings highlight the value of modeling seizure diversity within individuals and support the development of more personalized and interpretable seizure forecasting systems.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "An AI methodology to reduce training intensity, error rates, and size of neural networks",
      "content": "Massive computing systems are required to train neural networks. The prodigious amount of consumed energy makes the creation of AI applications significant polluters. Despite the enormous training effort, neural network error rates limit its use for medical applications, because errors can lead to intolerable morbidity and mortality. Two reasons contribute to the excessive training requirements and high error rates; an iterative reinforcement process (tuning) that does not guarantee convergence and the deployment of neuron models only capable of realizing linearly separable switching functions. tuning procedures require tens of thousands of training iterations. In addition, linearly separable neuron models have severely limited capability; which leads to large neural nets. For seven inputs, the ratio of total possible switching functions to linearly separable switching functions is 41 octillion. Addressed here is the creation of neuron models for the application of disease diagnosis. Algorithms are described that perform direct neuron creation. This results in far fewer training steps than that of current AI systems. The design algorithms result in neurons that do not manufacture errors (hallucinations). The algorithms utilize a template to create neuron models that are capable of performing any type of switching function. The algorithms show that a neuron model capable of performing both linearly and nonlinearly separable switching functions is vastly superior to the neuron models currently being used. Included examples illustrate use of the template for determining disease diagnoses (outputs) from symptoms (inputs). The examples show convergence with a single training iteration.",

      "title": "Universal differential equations as a unifying modeling language for neuroscience",
      "content": "The rapid growth of large-scale neuroscience datasets has spurred diverse modeling strategies, ranging from mechanistic models grounded in biophysics, to phenomenological descriptions of neural dynamics, to data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs). Each approach offers distinct strengths as mechanistic models provide interpretability, phenomenological models capture emergent dynamics, and DNNs excel at predictive accuracy but this also comes with limitations when applied in isolation. Universal differential equations (UDEs) offer a unifying modeling framework that integrates these complementary approaches. By treating differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable objects that can be combined with modern deep learning techniques, UDEs enable hybrid models that balance interpretability with predictive power. We provide a systematic overview of the UDE framework, covering its mathematical foundations, training methodologies, and recent innovations. We argue that UDEs fill a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience, with potential to advance applications in neural computation, neural control, neural decoding, and normative modeling in neuroscience.",
