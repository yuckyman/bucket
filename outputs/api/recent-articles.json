      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Hippocampal sequences traverse a memory space",
      "content": "Highly reliable sequential dynamics organize neural activity in the hippocampus and progress with changes in physical, sensory, or cognitive variables, typified by place cells during active exploration. But sensory and behavioral variables are often confounded, and so it remains intensely debated whether hippocampal sequences are driven by sensory content directly or rather reflect the alignment of internally generated dynamics to external perception. Here we used mouse virtual reality to characterize hippocampal dynamics in environments of systematically different sensory complexity, and to test the robustness of neural sequences to manipulations of exact sensory content. The structure of neural sequences was perturbed by changes in both moment-to-moment sensation and ongoing behavior, in a pattern that was best explained by the different memory strategies employed by the animal in each context. Neural subsequences could be flexibly interrupted, inserted, and resumed wherever a memory of prior experience was violated, indicating that the propagation of hippocampal dynamics was not rigidly fixed by internal networks and initial conditions. Rather, we argue that hippocampal sequences explore an abstract memory space of selectively remembered experiences, which flexibly encompasses both sensory and internal factors in a context-dependent manner.",
