      "title": "Reducing astrocyte calcium in the nucleus accumbens core increases reward valuation",
      "content": "Astrocyte dysfunction within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been increasingly implicated in maladaptive reward processing and the development of addiction-like behaviors. In this study, we investigated how impairing astrocyte calcium signaling in the NAc core influences consummatory reward behaviors and reward valuation. Using a viral approach to express the human plasma membrane calcium ATPase (hPMCA) in NAc core astrocytes in male rats, we selectively reduced intracellular astrocyte calcium dynamics. Blunting astrocyte calcium signaling led to increased self-administration of both sucrose and cocaine on a low effort fixed-ratio schedule of reinforcement. Behavioral economic analysis revealed enhanced reward motivation and valuation in hPMCA-expressing rats as compared to controls. Notably, reduction of astrocyte calcium signaling did not alter cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, indicating a dissociation between astrocytic regulation of reward valuation and other cocaine-related behaviors. Collectively, these results identify astrocyte calcium dynamics in the NAc core as a key constraint on motivational drive and reward valuation.",

      "title": "Structural specialization of mossy fiber boutons is necessary for their unique computational functions",
      "content": "Sparsely active granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) project onto CA3 pyramidal neurons through mossy fibers (MF), forming a feedforward network that ensures even similar inputs activate distinct and minimally overlapping populations of CA3 neurons. This process, known as pattern separation, is a key computational feature at this synapse. However, such sparse activity and connectivity increase the risk of information loss, as multiple presynaptic inputs are typically required to elicit a postsynaptic action potential. Interestingly, MF synapses exhibit robust short-term plasticity (STP), enabling a dynamic increase in release probability during brief bursts of presynaptic activity. This mechanism ensures that a short, high-frequency burst from a single granule cell can reliably generate a spike in its postsynaptic CA3 target. Unlike other hippocampal synapses, MF boutons are large, with multiple active zones, each coupled to a cluster of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs). MF boutons also possess a large readily releasable pool of vesicles. The functional consequences of this unusual synaptic design remain largely unexplored. In fact, the MF synapse is often depicted as a synapse with multiple sites, each behaving as an independent transmission line, analogous to several CA3 boutons contacting a single CA1 dendrite. We developed a physiologically realistic spatial model of the MF bouton to investigate how its peculiar structural and functional properties affect synaptic signaling and plasticity. Contrary to earlier assumptions, our computational model revealed, release sites are not independent transmission units. Crosstalk between calcium domains is necessary for the observed strong STP and for the timely activation of CA3 neurons. VDCCs in the MF bouton are only loosely coupled to active zones, and the distance between active zones is relatively large. In addition to the synaptic design and the known role of calbindin-D28k and synaptotagmin-7 in STP, we find that loose coupling of VDCCs to active zones and large inter-AZ distances are crucial. These features keep the basal release probability low, and their combined action is required to generate the facilitation that triggers postsynaptic action potentials in response to bursts filtering out non-informative dentate activity, and provides a strong rationale for the mossy fiber's synaptic architecture.",

      "title": "Cerebrospinal fluid flow and clearance driven by lateral ventricle volume oscillations",
      "content": "In the human brain, substance clearance is intimately connected to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its flow. CSF extends from the lateral ventricles (LVs) to the parenchyma's perivascular spaces. Macroscopic undulating CSF flow is present during both wakefulness and sleep and can be experimentally induced. However, the mechanisms generating this flow and its contribution to brain clearance remain unclear. Using fMRI and PET across various conditions, we demonstrate that LV-volume oscillations drive undulating CSF flow in the ventricles and subarachnoid basal cisternae. LV oscillations are driven by cortical blood-volume changes induced by neuronal activity, heartbeat and respiration. LV oscillations' amplitudes determine PET-tracer clearance from the LVs. Conclusively, induced by extra- and intracranial physiological drivers and mediated by cortical blood-volume changes, LV-volume oscillations drive macroscopic CSF flow and clearance.",

      "title": "Insights into Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Short Association Fiber Formation in the Human Fetal Brain",
      "content": "Short association fibers (SAFs) form the local scaffold of cortical connectivity, supporting early functional specialization and marking sites of neurodevelopmental vulnerability. However, their development before birth remains largely unknown. Leveraging advanced fetal diffusion MRI and a histology-validated framework, we present the first in-utero reconstruction of SAF pathways in the human brain. We tracked their volumetric and microstructural developmental trajectories in 243 fetuses spanning a critical period when the brain's connectome is rapidly forming. We found that SAFs emerge before sulcal folding, initially as flat, loosely arranged pathways along the subplate--white matter interface, and later reorganize into coherent U-shaped bundles. Their maturation followed a sensorimotor-to-association gradient, paralleling cortical development. Nonlinear, bundle-specific trajectories captured multiphasic maturation, with subplate dynamics preceding increases in axonal coherence and early myelination. By filling a missing link in lifespan brain connectivity, this study establishes a prenatal reference for cortical wiring and provides tools for investigating the origins of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "content": "Humans effortlessly juggle their internal thoughts, but the neuronal dynamics that support mental manipulation are largely unknown. Leveraging the high spatiotemporal fidelity of intracranial recordings in humans (N = 30), we provide evidence that mental sound manipulation involves the inhibition of sensory cortex and the coordinated engagement of memory and control networks. This modulation manifests in two ways. First, there is a shift in the balance between faster (> 30 Hz) and slower (< 30 Hz) dynamics in primary and secondary auditory areas, suggesting a decrease in local excitability. Second, there is a distributed increase in oscillatory synchrony (6-10 Hz), which predicts imagery vividness and task performance. This evidence points to a key role of local excitability and inter-areal synchrony in the manipulation of thought.",

      "title": "Ocular speech tracking persists in blindness, but its dynamics and oculo-cerebral connectivity depend on visual status",
      "content": "While eye movements have been shown to track the speech envelope, it is unknown whether this reflects a hard-wired mechanism or one shaped by (lifetime) audiovisual experience. Further, questions remain about whether ocular tracking is modulated by speech intelligibility and which brain regions drive these synchronized eye movements. Here, we investigate ocular speech tracking in blindfolded early blind, late blind, and sighted individuals using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and source-reconstructed oculomotor signals while participants listened to narrative speech of varying intelligibility. We found that oculomotor activity tracks acoustic speech features and, unlike neural speech tracking, is not modulated by intelligibility. Interestingly, we found effects reflected in two frequency-specific components: a low-frequency (~1 Hz) effect present across all groups, indicating that visual experience is not required, and a high-frequency (~6 Hz) effect reduced in early- and late-blind individuals. Moreover, this finding is not driven by cerebro-ocular connectivity, as late-blind individuals exhibit stronger connectivity between the eyes and the left temporal cortices without a corresponding increase in ocular tracking. In conclusion, ocular speech tracking seems to respond selectively to acoustic but not to intelligibility features of speech, and it does not require visual experience to develop. It may thus represent a hard-wired oculomotor mechanism within the oculo-cerebral network involved in speech processing.",

      "content": "Inhibitory interneurons, featuring presynaptic release sites and spiking activity in dendrites, present a puzzle in their signal organization and coordination. We investigated this in local interneurons (LINs) of the primary visual thalamus using two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice with both local and full-screen visual stimuli. Dendrites in single LINs showed consistent global responses to full-screen stimuli but varied responses to local stimuli. Dendrites from the same LIN exhibited different receptive fields that followed retinotopic progression. The similarity between dendritic and somatic responses decreased with increasing distance. Weak local stimuli could excite dendrites locally, while salient local stimuli triggered global responses. Salient global stimuli further enhanced motion selectivity, preference consistency, and peak responses. Thus, LINs leverage both local and global dendritic activation to perform spatially-organized, feature-selective, and size-dependent motion processing, providing new insights into the complexity and precision of sensory processing in the early visual system.",

      "content": "It is largely unknown how the brain encodes semantic distances between conceptual (verbal) knowledge. I presently show that the information on semantic distances is mainly embedded in a temporal measure (oscillation frequency) of human EEG waveforms. Participants judged a semantic relation between two words (synonym, antonym, thematically-related, taxonomically-related, or unrelated) sequentially presented. Brain rhythms (8-30 Hz) over the left language region, especially the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), were accelerated when a word pair with a high conceptual similarity (e.g. synonym) was presented. Importantly, this change in brain rhythm reflected an inter-word closeness as concepts (holistic similarity, typically seen in synonyms or thematically-related pairs), rather than an inter-word overlap of semantic features (partial similarity, typically seen in antonyms or taxonomically-related pairs). These results highlight a role of temporal measures of neural activity in semantic processing, which explains an inconsistency over previous results using hemodynamic measures.",

      "title": "A Potential Role of Postsynaptic Limitation in Activity-Dependent Homeostasis",
      "content": "The distribution of neurotransmitter release at amphibian neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) is characterised by a shift from Poisson to a tight binomial distribution as calcium concentration is increased. Despite advances in our understanding of neurotransmission, a paradox remains about how the large number of active zones (AZs) that contribute to release have such a low variance, resulting in a tight binomial distribution. Muscle-specific sodium channel-blocking neurotoxins have allowed us to examine the release characteristics when the unit size of transmitter release (quantal size) is not altered. Our present study has compared the neurotransmitter release characteristics when D-tubocurarine (curare) or the Na-channel blocking conotoxin (-conotoxin GIIIB) was used as the extracellular calcium concentration was increased. Quantal neurotransmitter release from toad iliofibularis motor nerve terminals was examined using intracellular electrodes and focal extracellular electrodes. Motor nerve terminal branches for recordings were located using DiOC2(5)-fluorescent imaging. Muscle action potentials were suppressed by using -conotoxin GIIIB (-CgTx GIIIB, 2.0 x 10-6 M) or curare, 6.5 x 10-6 M. Under -CgTx GIIIB, the maximum transmitter release reached was 25 quanta at high extracellular calcium concentration (2.1 mM); conversely, under curare, quantal content reached 148 quanta (P=0.0067). Using binomial analysis, it was found that this quantal increase was due to a significant increase in the number of release sites 'n' rather than the average probability of release 'p'. Based on these observations, along with analyses of ECP shape and duration, we propose a mechanism in which a fast autoinhibitory response (< 5 ms from the nerve terminal impulse) limits the maximum level of depolarisation by voltage-dependent regulation of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel conductance.",

      "content": "Music's ability to modulate arousal and manipulate emotions relies upon formation and violation of predictions. Music is often used to modulate arousal and mood while individuals focus on other tasks, suggesting that sophisticated musical prediction may be implicit and obligatory, operating regardless of attention. Here we investigated the role of attention in musical prediction by presenting participants simultaneously with a musical passage in one ear and an audiobook in the other. Participants were asked to attend to either speech or music to perform a recognition memory task. Musical prediction was investigated using a computational model of music which was trained on a corpus of Western music (long-term learning) and/or incrementally on each stimulus (short-term learning). While neural tracking of the acoustics of music, including encoding of note onset and pitch interval size, was enhanced by attention, musical prediction tracked the neural signal robustly regardless of attention. However, although neural tracking of long-term musical prediction based on previously-learned statistical patterns was unaffected by attention, tracking of short-term musical prediction learned from the structure of each stimulus was present only when the music was attended. Thus, attention is crucial for short-term musical learning and prediction but is not required for musical prediction based on long-term stylistic exposure.",
