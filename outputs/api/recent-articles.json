      "title": "Just launched Plano v0.4 - a unified data plane supporting polyglot AI development",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Thrilled to be launching <a href=\"https://github.com/katanemo/plano\">Plano</a> (0.4+)- an edge and service proxy (aka data plane) with orchestration for agentic apps. Plano offloads the rote plumbing work like orchestration, routing, observability and guardrails not central to any codebase but tightly coupled today in the application layer thanks to the many hundreds of AI frameworks out there.</p> <p>Runs alongside your app servers (cloud, on-prem, or local dev) deployed as a side-car, and leaves GPUs where your models are hosted.</p> <p><strong>The problem</strong></p> <p>AI practitioners will probably tell you that calling an LLM is not the hard. The really hard part is delivering agentic apps to production quickly and reliably, then iterating without rewriting system code every time. In practice, teams keep rebuilding the same concerns that sit outside any single agent\u2019s core logic:</p> <p>This includes model choice - the ability to pull from a large set of LLMs and swap providers without refactoring prompts or streaming handlers. Developers need to learn from production by collecting signals and traces that tell them what to fix. They also need consistent policy enforcement for moderation and jailbreak protection, rather than sprinkling hooks across codebases. And they need multi-agent patterns to improve performance and latency without turning their app into orchestration glue.</p> <p>These concerns get rebuilt and maintained inside fast-changing frameworks and application code, coupling product logic to infrastructure decisions. It\u2019s brittle, and pulls teams away from core product work into plumbing they shouldn\u2019t have to own.</p> <p><strong>What Plano does</strong></p> <p>Plano moves core delivery concerns out of process into a modular proxy and dataplane designed for agents. It supports inbound listeners (agent orchestration, safety and moderation hooks), outbound listeners (hosted or API-based LLM routing), or both together. Plano provides the following capabilities via a unified dataplane:</p> <p>- Orchestration: Low-latency routing and handoff between agents. Add or change agents without modifying app code, and evolve strategies centrally instead of duplicating logic across services.</p> <p>- Guardrails &amp; Memory Hooks: Apply jailbreak protection, content policies, and context workflows (rewriting, retrieval, redaction) once via filter chains. This centralizes governance and ensures consistent behavior across your stack.</p> <p>- Model Agility: Route by model name, semantic alias, or preference-based policies. Swap or add models without refactoring prompts, tool calls, or streaming handlers.</p> <p>- Agentic Signals\u2122: Zero-code capture of behavior signals, traces, and metrics across every agent, surfacing traces, token usage, and learning signals in one place.</p> <p>The goal is to keep application code focused on product logic while Plano owns delivery mechanics.</p> <p><strong>On Architecture</strong></p> <p>Plano has two main parts:</p> <p>Envoy-based data plane. Uses Envoy\u2019s HTTP connection management to talk to model APIs, services, and tool backends. We didn\u2019t build a separate model server\u2014Envoy already handles streaming, retries, timeouts, and connection pooling. Some of us were core Envoy contributors.</p> <p>Brightstaff, a lightweight controller and state machine written in Rust. It inspects prompts and conversation state, decides which agents to call and in what order, and coordinates routing and fallback. It uses small LLMs (1\u20134B parameters) trained for constrained routing and orchestration. These models do not generate responses and fall back to static policies on failure.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>**What My Project Does*\\</strong>*<br /> This is a simple console-based BMI calculator built in Python. It calculates your Body Mass Index, supports flexible units (weight in kg or lbs, height in cm/m/ft/in), automatically saves your history with dates, and gives personalized health advice based on BMI categories (Underweight to Extreme Obesity). It's fully offline and stores data in a text file so your records persist between runs.</p> <p><strong>**Target Audience*\\</strong>*<br /> This is primarily a toy/learning project for beginners like me (first real shipped app after ~1 month of Python from zero). It's useful for anyone wanting a private, no-internet BMI tracker (e.g., students, fitness enthusiasts, or people who prefer console tools over web/apps). Not meant for production or medical use \u2014 just fun and educational!</p> <p><strong>**Comparison*\\</strong>*<br /> Unlike online BMI calculators (which require internet and don't save history), or basic scripts (which often lack unit flexibility or persistence), this one combines:<br /> - Multi-unit input (no conversion needed by user)<br /> - Automatic file-based history tracking<br /> - Motivational messages per category<br /> - Easy menu and delete option<br /> It's more feature-rich than most beginner projects while staying simple and local.</p> <p>Repo link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker</a></p> <p>Screenshots:<br /> ![Menu](<a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/menu.png\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/menu.png</a>)<br /> ![Calculation](<a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/calculation.png\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/calculation.png</a>)<br /> ![History](<a href=\"https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/history.png\">https://github.com/Kunalcoded/bmi-health-tracker/raw/main/history.png</a>)</p> <p>Feedback welcome!

      "title": "Investigating cross-memory interactions of timing structures",
      "content": "Motor and episodic memories are classically conceptualised as distinct memory domains. However, both memory sequences are characterised by order and timing of their elements. Generalisation has been previously documented between these different memories, with a shared ordinal structure facilitating learning. However, it is unclear whether this generalisation also applies to the timing structure of a sequence. In a between-subject design, healthy adults (N = 143) learned and reproduced motor and episodic memory sequences with either the same or different timing structures. Contrary to expectations, recall of an episodic timeline was poorer when preceded by learning a motor sequence with the same timing structure. Motor sequence reproduction was not affected by prior episodic encoding. The findings do not support the hypothesis of cross-domain generalisation of timing structure between episodic and motor memories. However, the observed interference may suggest some overlap in the mechanism encoding timing information between memory systems.",

      "title": "Whole-genome profiling of native 5-hydroxymethylation in human neurons with long-read sequencing",
      "content": "The 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification of DNA is particularly prevalent in neurons and thereby a hallmark of the brain's epigenetic landscape. While 5mC DNA methylation is a well-known player in genome stability and transcriptional regulation, the role of 5hmC remains largely unknown. Here, we used long-read Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to profile whole-genome, native 5mC and 5hmC levels in sorted neuronal nuclei samples from human post-mortem brain tissue. We applied different models for DNA modification calling and compared with array-based 5mC and 5hmC levels derived from the same samples, demonstrating high sample-wise correlations. Annotation across genomic and regulatory features, as well as chromatin states, generated by the International Human Epigenome Consortium, revealed high levels of 5hmC in introns, actively transcribed genes and (distal) enhancers. Pathway analysis of genes with high levels of 5hmC (> 60%) were enriched in neuron-related terms, with functional variety when stratifying across chromatin states. Analysis of transcription factor motifs in highly methylated regions, demonstrated 5hmC- and 5mC-specific enrichment affecting downstream regulatory networks. Altogether, our study demonstrates the potential of ONT to characterize whole-genome, native 5hmC and 5mC DNA modifications in human neurons, specifically highlighting the enrichment of 5hmC in actively transcribed regions and enhancers in the human brain.",

      "title": "fMRI-Based Prediction of Eye Gaze During Naturalistic Movie Viewing Reveals Eye-Movement-Related Brain Activity",
      "content": "Eye gaze and eye movements provide important indices of perceptual and cognitive processes, particularly under naturalistic conditions such as movie viewing. However, concurrent eye tracking is often unavailable in functional MRI (fMRI) studies due to technical and logistical constraints. Recent deep learning approaches have made it possible to estimate eye gaze directly from eyeball signals in fMRI data, offering a potential alternative to camera-based eye tracking. Here, we applied a pre-trained fMRI-based deep neural network model (DeepMReye) to estimate eye gaze during movie watching across three independent fMRI datasets. Model performance was evaluated by comparison with camera-based eye-tracking data when available, as well as by assessing inter-individual correlations, a commonly used benchmark in naturalistic fMRI research. At the individual level, predicted gaze showed modest correspondence with measured data (r ranged from 0.38 to 0.67). In contrast, group-averaged gaze predictions exhibited substantially higher correlations (r ranged from 0.7 to 0.8), indicating improved reliability at the group level. We further derived eye-movement-related time series from the predicted gaze signals and examined their associated brain activity. Consistent with differences in prediction accuracy, individual-level analyses yielded activation patterns largely restricted to visual cortex, whereas group-averaged predictions revealed more widespread activation, including established oculomotor control regions such as frontal and parietal eye fields. Exploratory analyses indicated age-related effects on gaze prediction accuracy and eye-movement-related brain activity, although these effects were not consistent across datasets. Together, these findings demonstrate that group-averaged fMRI-based gaze estimation can support the investigation of eye-movement-related brain activity in naturalistic paradigms, while highlighting current limitations for individual-level inference. The results provide a methodological assessment of fMRI-based gaze prediction and inform its appropriate use in future neuroimaging studies.",

I wrote a small (&lt;200 lines) pure-Python tool called signal-scope.</p> <p>What My Project Does</p> <p>signal-scope is a tiny Python library for analyzing 1D time-series data. It produces lightweight versions of common signal diagnostics: - trend strength - volatility - drift detection - regime shift indicators - anomaly scoring - optional matplotlib visualizations</p> <p>It\u2019s meant as a fast, readable tool for exploratory analysis. As opposed to pulling in large scientific stacks.</p> <p>Target Audience</p> <p>This project is intended for: - students learning time-series or signal processing - researchers &amp; grad students in need of quick diagnostics in scripts / notebooks - data analysts doing exploratory work - hobbyists working with finance, sensors, forecasting, or anomaly detection - anyone who wants a tiny, transparent reference implementation instead of a big dependency</p> <p>What This Project Isn\u2019t</p> <p>It\u2019s not a replacement for full frameworks like statsmodels, tsfresh, kats / merlion, scipy.signal</p> <p>It\u2019s just supposed to be a super-lightweight diagnostic layer. Just drop into small scripts.</p> <p>Comparison</p> <p>In contrast to larger time-series packages, signal-scope provides: - dramatically smaller codebase - simple API: analyze_ts(...) - no config overhead - zero external dependencies besides numpy/matplotlib - easy reading &amp; extension for people learning TS analysis - quick integration into Jupyter notebooks or scripts</p> <p>Again, these are all intentionally minimalistic.

      "title": "Semaglutide Attenuates Neuroinflammation in Mice",
      "content": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown promise in preclinical models of neurodegeneration, with emerging evidence suggesting these effects may be driven by modulation of neuroinflammation. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying GLP-1 RA effects on neuroinflammation remain poorly understood. Here, using a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation, we investigated how semaglutide coordinates cellular responses to resolve neuroinflammation. We find that semaglutide prevents brain infiltration of neutrophils, excessive cytokine release, and suppresses neuroinflammation-associated transcriptional signatures specifically in microglia, endothelial cells, and a subset of pericytes. Mechanistically, we identify a subset of Glp1r-expressing neurons in the dorsal vagal complex that, upon semaglutide treatment, regulate genes involved in anti-inflammatory signaling. Semaglutide-modulated pathways overlap with inflammatory signatures found in human neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, suggesting broad relevance for conditions involving neuroinflammation. Together, these findings reveal how GLP-1R signaling orchestrates resolution of neuroinflammation through coordinated multi-cellular programs.",

      "title": "Glial vesicular transmitter release is not critical for courtship conditioning memory in Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "Glial cell function is believed to be critical for the regulation of cognitive processes such as learning and memory but the mechanisms by which glia regulate memory are still poorly elucidated. There is evidence that glial metabolic support and neurotransmitter synaptic clearance are essential for memory processes. But glial cells can also influence neuronal activity by the vesicular release of gliotransmitters in a calcium-dependent manner. Whether gliotransmission also is critical for memory process remains controversial. Here, we explored the role of gliotransmission in Drosophila courtship memory using the thermo-sensitive Shibirets mutant in combination with the UAS/Gal4 expression system, in which glial vesicular transmitter release can be rapid and reversibly impaired. We found that the formation, maintenance and decline of courtship memory were unaffected by the blockade of vesicular release of gliotransmitters. Therefore, our data support the view that the release of gliotransmitters is not an ubiquitously necessary regulatory mechanism of memory and forgetting processes.",

      "title": "Regular parental exercise before mating influences offspring lower adiposity associated to hypothalamic neurodevelopmental changes",
      "content": "Physical inactivity is highly prevalent worldwide and affects not only individual health but also the health of future generations. However, the impact of parental physical activity, limited to the pre-mating period, on offspring body weight and composition remains poorly understood. Using a voluntary wheel running approach in mice, we uncovered that post-weaning offspring body weight and composition changes are modulated by the combined effects of pre-mating parental exercise and parental age. Notably, during lactation, pre-mating parental exercise reduced offspring visceral and subcutaneous adiposity, shortened tibia length in female offspring, and influenced offspring transcriptomic profiles of the hypothalamus, the central region regulating body weight and energy balance. These results highlight that regular pre-mating parental exercise may induce offspring neurodevelopmental changes. Although pre-mating exercise minimally impacted the expression of lactation-related genes in maternal subcutaneous fat, as well as breastmilk nutritional composition and miRNA content, these modest miRNA changes may nonetheless influence offspring hypothalamic regulation. Together, these data provide a comprehensive understanding of how parental age and pre-mating exercise impact post-weaning offspring body weight and composition and offer deeper insights into how regular pre-mating parental exercise influences offspring physiology during lactation.",
