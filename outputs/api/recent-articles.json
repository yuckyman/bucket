      "title": "Drowsiness alters the neural dynamics but not the core computations of multisensory integration",
      "content": "Fluctuations in alertness shape perception and behaviour, yet how they affect the brain's ability to integrate information across senses remains poorly understood. Here we investigated whether multisensory integration is preserved as humans transition from wakefulness to drowsiness. Participants performed an audio-tactile detection task while electroencephalography tracked spontaneous declines in alertness. Behaviourally, multisensory stimulation continued to facilitate responses during drowsiness, despite slowing and increased omissions. However, reaction-time distributions revealed reduced violations of race-model predictions, indicating weakened computational evidence for multisensory integration. Neurally, event-related signatures of multisensory interactions were delayed and attenuated during drowsiness. By contrast, multivariate decoding showed that multisensory neural representations remained detectable, although less temporally stable. Crucially, early cross-state generalization revealed shared representational structure across alertness states, indicating preserved core multisensory computations. These findings show that multisensory integration remains functional but is dynamically altered as alertness declines, revealing how the brain maintains adaptive behaviour during the wake-to-sleep transition.",

      "title": "A Drosophila screen identifies domino as a link between chromatin regulation and synaptic organization",
      "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with diverse genetic risk factors. To identify conserved mechanisms underlying ASD-related phenotypes, we conducted a targeted screen in Drosophila using MiMIC insertion mutants of high-confidence genes from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database. Behavioral assays identified 52 heterozygous lines with significant changes in sleep, activity, or social behavior in one or both sexes. Among these, the chromatin remodeler domino (dom), the ortholog of human SRCAP, emerged as a particularly compelling candidate. Heterozygous dom mutants exhibited altered social spacing and male-biased sleep and activity dysregulation, phenotypes that were replicated in an additional allele. RNA-sequencing of adult brains showed that reduced dom expression affected genes involved in signaling and structural pathways in both sexes, offering potential molecular links to the behavioral outcomes. In addition, dom disruption caused widespread splicing dysregulation, with differentially spliced genes enriched for pathways related to synaptic signaling, further implicating synaptic communication as a convergent mechanism. Consistent with these results, immunofluorescence revealed increased synaptic architecture in the antennal lobe, a brain region associated with sleep and sensory processing. Together, these findings highlight the utility of Drosophila for modeling conserved ASD risk genes and implicate domino in the regulation of synaptic communication and behavior through transcriptional and splicing regulation.",

      "title": "Repeated Mild Head Injury Establishes a Senescent Cranial Bone Marrow Niche that Impairs Brain Metabolism",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) of any severity is associated with long-term systemic inflammation and increased risk of peripheral comorbidities, yet the mechanisms driving immune dysregulation and accelerated aging after repeated mild head impacts remain poorly defined. Here, we investigated the acute and chronic effects of repeated mild TBI (rmTBI) on distal and proximal bone marrow compartments in the femur and calvaria, respectively. Using a modified weight-drop mouse model delivering rotational and acceleration/deceleration forces (3 hits/week for up to 16 weeks), rmTBI produced no mortality, skull fracture, hemorrhage, or brain leukocyte infiltration. One day after three consecutive impacts, rmTBI induced robust proliferation of LSK stem/progenitor cells in both femoral and calvarial marrow, evidenced by Ki67 expression, BrdU incorporation, and increased monocyte output. By 8 weeks (24 impacts), injury-induced proliferation subsided and LSK cells exhibited increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and upregulation of tumor suppressor genes. At 16 weeks (48 impacts), LSK populations were depleted at both sites, displaying reduced proliferative capacity, telomere shortening, and pancytopenia in otherwise young adult mice. Calvarial bone marrow cells exposed to rmTBI released a distinct cytokine and proteomic secretome marked by elevated IL-6, suppressed mitochondrial and metabolic signaling, and enhanced DNA repair pathways. Notably, skull-derived secretome factors impaired cortical and hippocampal mitochondrial metabolism, and reduced microglial mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, these findings identify replicative senescence of the brain-adjacent bone marrow niche as an early and progressive consequence of repeated mild head injury, linking rmTBI to long-lasting metabolic dysfunction, impaired immunity, and accelerated aging.",

      "title": "Restoration of Rapid-Eye Movement Sleep During Cocaine Abstinence Reduces Incubation of Cocaine Seeking and Normalizes Dopamine Transporter Function",
      "content": "Progressive increases in cocaine craving or seeking during abstinence from cocaine are thought to contribute to relapse. Recent observations suggest that sleep disruptions during abstinence from cocaine may have a significant influence on cocaine seeking. While the neural mechanisms underlying the association between sleep disruptions and increases in cocaine seeking during abstinence continue to be investigated, alterations in mesolimbic dopamine transmission may be a common factor. In these studies, we assessed whether sleep disruptions during abstinence are associated with incubation of cocaine seeking and dopamine terminal adaptations in the nucleus accumbens core of female and male rats. We observed that intermittent access to cocaine followed by abstinence reduced rapid-eye movement sleep, intensified cue-induced cocaine seeking, and enhanced dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. Notably, a sleep restoration procedure that restricted sleep to the light phase (active period) restored rapid-eye movement sleep, prevented incubation of cocaine seeking, and normalized baseline dopamine uptake and dopamine transporter sensitivity to cocaine. These findings indicate that rapid-eye movement sleep disruptions during abstinence contribute to exaggerated cocaine seeking and that dopamine transporter adaptations are a potential molecular substrate through which these changes occur. Thus, interventions that restore sleep during cocaine abstinence may serve as effective behavioral therapies for reducing cocaine craving and preventing subsequent relapse.",

      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

      "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

      "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
      "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

      "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations.

      "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
      "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

      "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
      "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

      "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

      "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

      "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
      "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

      "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",
