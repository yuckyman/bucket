      "title": "BDNF-induced axonal mTOR activation promotes Rab5 translation, axonal transport, and CREB phosphorylation in cortical neurons.",
      "content": "Neuronal plasticity, essential for learning and memory, involves structural changes triggered by neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF activates its receptor, TrkB, to induce local and long-distance signaling, promoting dendritic branching. While BDNF activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is well-documented in dendritic spines, its role in axons remains unclear. Using compartmentalized cultures of embryonic cortical neurons from mice, this study demonstrates that axonal BDNF triggers mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of translation regulators (4E-BP1 and S6), driving local protein synthesis. Fluorescent labeling, immunostaining, and radial microfluidic chambers were employed to isolate axonal compartments and assess local translation. Axonal BDNF increased Rab5 protein translation in a TrkB- and mTOR-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of localized protein synthesis for axonal trafficking. Furthermore, axonal protein synthesis was required for retrograde transport of internalized cargoes and CREB activation in the nucleus, linking local translation to long-distance signaling. These findings highlight the crucial role of axonal mTOR activation in regulating local proteostasis and neuronal function, offering new insights into axonal trafficking mechanisms and their implications for neuroplasticity. This work advances our understanding of how mTOR activation in axons and localized translation induced by BDNF are essential for axonal transport and efficient signaling in cortical neurons.",

      "title": "Hunger Recruits a Parallel Circuit Encoding Alcohol Reward",
      "content": "Internal states like hunger, pain, thirst and arousal can bias behavior by affecting sensory and memory processing. Internal states are critical to understand in the context of alcohol addiction because they influence cravings, reinstatement, and relapse. Norepinephrine plays a key role in both hunger and alcohol-induced arousal and preference, but the circuit-level mechanisms through which it modulates the influence of hunger on alcohol preference are not well understood. We sought to address this using intersectional genetic tools for manipulating neurons expressing octopamine, the invertebrate analogue of vertebrate norepinephrine. We identified a single octopamine neuron required for ethanol seeking only when Drosophila are food-deprived. Hunger increased baseline activity in this neuron, making it more responsive to an odor cue previously paired with ethanol. A combination of genetic and connectome analyses revealed that synaptic partners of this octopaminergic neuron form a functional module that acts on Drosophila memory circuitry. Thus, we show that hunger recruits a parallel circuit that drives learned ethanol preference, providing a neuronal framework through which internal state influences the expression of memory for ethanol-associated cues.",

      "title": "Psilocybin exerts differential effects on social behaviour and inflammation in mice in contexts of activity-based anorexia (ABA)",
      "content": "Psychedelics, particularly psilocybin, have shown therapeutic potential across several psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and anorexia nervosa (AN). These disorders often share social deficits that may be effectively alleviated by psychedelics considering their use has been linked with emotional empathy and enhanced social cognition. However, the mechanisms through which psychedelics alter social behaviour are unclear, and mechanistic studies in animal models have largely focused on male subjects. This is problematic for understanding the therapeutic effects relevant for disorders that predominantly affect females, such as AN. Here, we used the activity-based anorexia (ABA) mouse model to examine the effects of a single psilocybin dose on social behaviour in female mice and compared outcomes to mice exposed to food restriction (FR), exercise (RW) or standard housing (Controls). Together with these metabolic stressors, we also investigated the effects of psilocybin on the circulating proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is implicated in AN and is suppressed by psychedelics. Psilocybin did not alter sociability in ABA, RW, or FR mice but increased preference for familiarity in Controls. Novelty-seeking behaviour was elevated in both ABA and RW groups, although with distinct social patterns. Psilocybin elevated IL-6 levels in RW mice, which was positively correlated with preference for novelty. No such relationships were found in ABA or FR groups. These findings reveal subtle, context-dependent effects of psilocybin on social behaviour and inflammation in female mice, highlighting the need to clarify its temporal, neuroplastic, and immune-related mechanisms across sexes and disease models.",

      "content": "Motor and declarative memory systems have been traditionally considered distinct. However, a study by Mosha and Robertson (2016) reported striking evidence of generalisation between motor and declarative learning. Specifically, learning improved if the current task (e.g. motor sequence) shared the same high-level ordinal structure as an earlier task (e.g. word list), demonstrating cross-domain transfer of unstable memories. This finding has significant implications for our understanding and conceptualisation of memory taxonomies but has not been replicated. Here, healthy adult participants (N = 125) completed a word list and motor sequence task in counterbalanced order with either a shared or distinct sequence structure. In contrast to Mosha & Robertson (2016), we found that a shared ordinal structure between the declarative and motor sequence tasks did not facilitate performance. Overall, our results challenge the robustness of cross-domain generalisation, and underscore the complexity of cross-memory interactions.",

      "title": "Drift-diffusion dynamics of the hippocampal replay",
      "content": "Replay activities in the hippocampus and other brain regions during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are thought to play important roles in learning, memory, and planning. Surprisingly, the question of how to characterize the dynamical structure of replay remains controversial. Standard methods rely on restrictive assumptions for detecting replay events with high sequentiality, and they have substantial drawbacks. To fill this gap, we develop a flexible and highly interpretable computational framework based on state-space modeling to understand the dynamics of replays. This framework is motivated by the basic idea that sequential structures can be modeled using drift-diffusion dynamics. The two parameters (i.e., drift & diffusion parameters) can be directly mapped to the speed and variability of a replay event, respectively. To capture the potentially rich neural dynamics during SWRs, our model allows the switching between several well-motivated types of dynamics. The resulting framework enables precise and unambiguous interpretations of the dynamics of SWR events. Applications of our method to population recordings from the rat hippocampus lead to insights into a number of important open questions, including: (i) whether the speed of most replay events is comparable to real-world running; (ii) whether replays follow random walk; (iii) whether \"preplay\" events exist. More broadly, accurate characterizations of replay dynamics may lead to a better understanding of the role of replay under normal and abnormal conditions.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "content": "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has emerged as a widely accessible, noninvasive technique capable of modulating cortical excitability. A rapidly expanding body of sports-science literature suggests that it can produce modest but measurable gains in endurance, strength, skill acquisition, and perceived exertion. This editorial reviews the physiological mechanisms underlying tDCS, evaluates the evidence for its ergogenic effects, and situates the technology within the broader...",

The \u03b4/\u03b8 power reconfiguration implicates thalamocortical rhythm stabilization as a potential therapeutic target, advancing our mechanistic understanding of non-invasive neuromodulation in migraine management.",

      "content": "The resting primate brain is traversed by spontaneous functional connectivity patterns that show striking differences between conscious and unconscious states. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique, can improve signs of consciousness in disorders of consciousness (DOCs); however, can it influence both conscious and unconscious dynamic functional connectivity? We investigated the modulatory effect of prefrontal cortex (PFC) tDCS on brain dynamics...",
