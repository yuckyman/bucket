      "title": "A human iPSC-derived motor neuron-myogenic cell coculture platform to evaluate neuromuscular junction innervation after axon injury and in Spinal Muscular Atrophy",
      "content": "Traumatic nerve injury is challenging as motor neurons with damaged axons repair slowly, which can lead to muscle degeneration, while in Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), muscle innervation is reduced. While pro-regenerative or neuroprotective compounds have been identified, their specific ability to enhance or restore neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function in patients remains unclear due to a lack of in vitro human models that track axon growth, NMJ innervation and muscle function. We developed a human iPSC-derived motor neuron-myogenic coculture platform that enables real-time monitoring of axon growth NMJ innervation and axon regeneration and muscle activity following axonal injury, and for SMA-derived motor neurons. We identified spontaneous synchronized GCaMP6f muscle activity as a useful functional marker of NMJ formation. Using this platform, we show that blebbistatin, a pro-regenerative non-muscle myosin II (NMII) inhibitor differentially regulates growth cone dynamics in injured versus uninjured motor neurons, resulting in enhanced NMJ reinnervation. This highlights the therapeutic potential of developing pro-regenerative compounds to promote NMJ innervation. We also confirm that NMJ function is reduced in SMA type 0 (prenatal onset) and type I (pediatric onset) patient-derived motor neurons in the coculture. This human stem cell-based framework can be used, therefore, to evaluate pro-regenerative compounds for axon injury and neuroprotective one for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Primate ACC encodes natural vocal interactions in a cocktail party",
      "content": "The Cocktail Party Problem (CPP) - extracting meaningful signals amid competing voices - remains poorly understood at the neural level, particularly in real-world contexts where it emerges naturally. We investigated the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to resolve the CPP, a structure implicated in social monitoring but rarely examined in relation to audition, in freely-moving marmoset monkeys engaged in vocal exchanges with conspecifics in a noisy ecological environment. Analyses revealed that this neural substrate is seemingly integral to resolving the CPP. Not only did neurons encode the calls of either the conversational partner or background callers (i.e. figure/ground separation), but this selectivity persisted even with overlapping background sounds, a hallmark of the CPP. ACC was also sensitive to conversational dynamics by encoding turn-taking structure. These findings reveal that the ACC regulates dynamic vocal interactions in complex social soundscapes in which parsing meaningful calls from competing sounds is essential for effective communication.",

      "content": "Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique that generates artifacts in simultaneous EEG recordings, hindering brain activity analysis. This study analyzes Machine Learning (ML) methods for tES noise artifact removal across three stimulation types: tDCS, tACS, and tRNS. Synthetic datasets were created by combining clean EEG data with synthetic tES artifacts. Eleven artifact removal techniques were tested and evaluated using the Root Relative Mean Squared...",

Yet how functional networks regulate developmental changes in brain morphology remains unclear. Here, we analyzed gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) in 301 individuals with ASD and 375 typically developing controls (TDCs), aged 8-18 years, from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE). Using a sliding-window approach, participants were stratified by age,...",

Although it is a frequent disorder, with a reported lifetime prevalence of 35.2% in the general population, its pathophysiological underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Notably, PSH frequently coexists with other primary headache disorders, particularly migraine, suggesting a possible shared biology.",
