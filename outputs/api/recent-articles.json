      "title": "Operations Near the Edge of cognitive decline: Behavioral and Neural Correlates of cognitive load in Mild cognitive impairment",
      "content": "Motivation: Early detection of cognitive strain is essential for identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and its progression to more severe neurodegenerative diseases. This study investigates cognitive strain in MCI by examining both behavioral and neural correlates during a real-world task. Methods: Twenty-four older adults (M=69, 14 male, 10 female), including 11 with MCI and 13 healthy controls (MMSE >22/30), performed a spatial navigation task under varying memory load. We recorded brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) and a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to capture error-related potentials (ErrPs), which reflect cognitive load and processing errors. Results: Both groups showed a decline in working memory performance as cognitive load increased ({beta} = -41.39, SE = 10.73, t(90) = -3.86, p < .001). MCI participants, however, exhibited more efficient use of non-intrinsic (allocentric) reference frames under high cognitive load ({beta} = 2.47, SE = 0.95, t(82) = 2.61, p = .009). MCI individuals also displayed larger ErrPs in central brain regions, indicating greater neural resource allocation. Additionally, MCI participants showed a decrease in parietal-to-frontal theta dominance under high load ({beta} = -0.68, SE = 0.32, t(90) = -2.12, p = .037), and reduced fronto-parietal connectivity. Discussion: These findings suggest that MCI participants experience greater cognitive strain, evidenced by increased neural resource allocation and strategy-shifting under load. This heightened strain may serve as an early marker of MCI progression, offering potential for early detection of pathological changes.",

      "title": "Facilitating the Supplementary Motor Area Activity Reduces Variability of Ball Arrival Position in Accurate Ball Throwing Performance",
      "content": "Maintaining high accuracy during rapid, dynamic movements is a significant challenge for the central nervous system. The supplementary motor area (SMA) is a key cortical region for orchestrating motor commands and regulating movement variability, yet its causal role in maintaining precision during high-speed tasks remains to be fully elucidated. We investigated the impact of modulating SMA excitability on throwing performance in fourteen healthy novices. Participants performed maximal and submaximal (50% effort) throwing tasks before and after receiving intermittent (facilitatory) or continuous (inhibitory) theta burst stimulation (TBS) over the SMA. Outcome measures included ball speed, variability of pitch location--quantified as variable error (95% confidence ellipse area) and absolute error (Euclidean distance from the ellipse center to the target)--and introspective ratings of performance via visual analog scales (VAS). Results showed that intermittent TBS (iTBS) significantly reduced the variable error of pitch location during maximal-effort throwing--where neural noise is theoretically elevated--without compromising ball speed. In contrast, no significant changes in performance were observed following continuous TBS or during the submaximal throwing task. Notably, objective precision gains under iTBS were dissociated from subjective ratings of accuracy, which increased globally over time independent of stimulation type. These findings demonstrate that the SMA plays a critical causal role in stabilizing motor output under high motor drive. This study suggests that SMA-mediated stabilization operates as a subconscious process, offering new insights for optimizing complex motor skills.",

      "content": "IntroductionOsteoporosis is the leading cause of sudden bone fractures. This is a silent and deadly disease that can affect any part of the body, such as the spine, hips, and knee bones.AimTo measure bone mineral density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans help radiologists and other medical professionals identify early signs of osteoporosis in the spine.MethodsA proposed 21-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented and validated to automatically detect osteoporosis in spine DXA images. The dataset contains 174 spine DXA images, including 114 affected by osteoporosis and the rest normal or non-fractured. To improve training, the dataset is expanded using various data augmentation techniques.ResultsThe classification performance of the proposed model is compared with that of four popular pre-trained models: ResNet-50, Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG-16), VGG-19, and InceptionV3. With an F1-score of 97.16%, recall of 95.41%, classification accuracy of 97.14%, and precision of 99.04%, the proposed model consistently outperforms competing approaches.ConclusionThe proposed paradigm would therefore be very valuable to radiologists and other medical professionals. The proposed approach\u2019s capacity to detect, monitor, and diagnose osteoporosis may reduce the risk of developing the condition.",

      "title": "Differential Effects of 5-HT7 Receptor Signaling in the Noradrenergic System in a Rat Model of Treatment-Resistant Depression",
      "content": "Introduction: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major clinical challenge, and its neurobiological basis remains unclear. The locus coeruleus (LC), a key noradrenergic hub, shows altered activity in TRD models, and serotonergic 5-HT7 receptors have emerged as potential modulators of this circuit. Methods: We assessed the impact of 5-HT7 receptor activation on LC function in Wistar Kyoto rats, an established TRD model, using in vivo extracellular recordings, in vitro patch-clamp assays, and receptor expression analysis. Results: Systemic administration of AS19, a selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, increased LC neuronal firing in both strains, with a significantly greater effect in Wistar Kyoto rats. This response was prevented by a 5-HT7 antagonist confirming receptor specificity. Glutamatergic blockade altered AS19 effects in a strain-dependent manner, whereas in vitro assays revealed no differential postsynaptic modulation and similar presynaptic inhibition across groups. Western blot analysis showed elevated 5-HT7 receptor expression in the LC, ventral hippocampus, and amygdala of Wistar Kyoto rats, alongside reduced expression in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: These findings indicate that 5-HT7 receptor activation exerts complex, circuit-dependent modulation of LC activity, influenced by glutamatergic and serotonergic inputs. Enhanced receptor expression in limbic regions and altered LC responsiveness may contribute to TRD pathophysiology and highlight 5-HT7 signaling as a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Humanized Kcnv2 E151X Mouse Captures Hallmarks of KCNV2-Associated Retinal Dystrophy",
      "content": "Background: KCNV2-associated retinopathy is a rare inherited retinal dystrophy caused by variants in the KCNV2 gene, leading to disrupted photoreceptor function and slowly progressive vision loss. Patients have characteristic electroretinography abnormalities, including reduced cone responses, delayed and reduced rod responses to low light flashes and paradoxically large rod-driven responses to bright flashes of light. To model this condition, we generated the Kcnv2 E151X mouse line and assessed its structural and functional retinal features. Methods: We have employed CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing technology to generate a mouse line with an early stop mutation in position E151 - orthologous to the commonly encountered E143X mutation in humans - and performed a combination of immunohistochemistry and Western Blot to confirm the absence of the full-length KCNV2-encoded protein, Kv8.2. To assess how closely it models the human disease, we have characterised the KCNV2 mutant mouse line at histological and functional levels employing immunohistochemistry and electroretinography, respectively. Results: Kcnv2 mutant mice showed markedly reduced photopic responses and reproduced the supernormal rod phenotype as described in affected individuals. In the morphological context, mutant retinas demonstrated strong and early glial fibrillary acidic protein upregulation together with reduced counts of cone arrestin positive cells as well as photoreceptors in general. Conclusions: The Kcnv2 mutant mouse line replicates key functional and structural hallmarks of KCNV2-associated retinopathy. This model provides a relevant platform for mechanistic studies and preclinical evaluation of gene based or pharmacological therapies targeting cone and rod photoreceptor dysfunction.",
