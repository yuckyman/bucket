      "title": "Drawing the Line: Wearable Linear Haptics Motivated by Guided Breathing",
      "content": "Haptic wearables provide an intuitive human-machine interface to convey information through the sense of touch, which may have promising applications in guided breathing. In this paper, we detail the design and evaluation of three wearable prototypes (Vibration, Skin Drag, and Tapping) capable of administering discrete (individual, separate pulses and stimuli). and continuous (overlapping or uninterrupted stimuli) forms of linear haptic cycles with inspiration from slow, deep guided breathing. Characterization was performed to quantify and validate the performance of six haptic stimuli (discrete/continuous vibration, skin drag, and tapping). Devices were quantified with key metrics that described the applied stimuli and the dynamics of the wearable. A human subjects study (N = 25), composed of two-cycle tracking tasks, was conducted to determine device performance and user aptitude. Results indicated consistent directional recognition across all six stimuli, but discrete stimuli performed better in spatial localization tasks. Although outperformed in tracking/localization tasks, continuous stimuli, especially skin drag, were described as the most apt and intuitive pairing to guided breathing. Findings highlight the potential of these linear haptic stimuli in a number of applications, including guided breathing, navigation, virtual immersion, and communication.",

      "title": "Haptics of Pulse Palpation: Simulation and Validation Through Novel Sensor-Actuator System",
      "content": "Palpation of arteries holds significant physiological importance. Existing pulse actuator designs intended to replicate the haptic sensations of palpation primarily focus on normal force interactions, often overlooking the shear forces generated by oscillations of the arterial wall during blood flow. This study aims to evaluate the normal, longitudinal, and transverse forces exerted by arteries through both theoretical and experimental analyses during palpation. The experimental validation features a pulse actuator-sensor system. The actuator component is a hydroelectromagnetic actuator, while the haptic sensing is performed by the Subblescope. The Subblescope measures arterial force feedback from both soft and hard artery models, as well as from the radial pulse in 18 human subjects. Mathematical analysis establishes the operational range of the sensor-actuator system as 0.005 N to 2.5 N. The force feedback from the simulation has been used for designing the total force generation by the actuator. The reactive force along the Z-axis varies between 19.3 mN to 500 mN, while the transverse and longitudinal forces along the Y and X axes range from 6.9 mN to 88.01 mN and 5.46 mN to 87.85 mN, respectively. The pulse-force map of the hard artery reveals higher three-dimensional force interactions compared to the soft artery. The hydroelectromagnetic actuator effectively generates both normal and shear forces during pulsatile flow. Future work will focus on developing training modules that replicate pulse haptics associated with various physiological conditions such as diabetes.",

      "title": "HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface With Hierarchical Force Control",
      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

      "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
      "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

      "title": "Tau-induced ribosomal collisions impair memory through the activation of the integrated stress response",
      "content": "The formation of new long-term memories is reliant upon the spatial and temporal regulation of mRNA translation. Translational control has been demonstrated to be disrupted in neurodegenerative diseases, which exhibit impairments in both homeostatic translation and memory formation, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, the precise mechanisms by which this dysregulation occurs, as well as the pathogenic consequences of this dysregulation have yet to be described. Here we establish that FTD-associated tau mutations impair protein synthesis prior to the onset of memory impairments by slowing ribosomal elongation speed, causing ribosomes to collide upon mRNAs. We reveal that this tau-induced ribosomal collision ultimately impairs memory-associated translation through activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) via GCN2. Pharmacological prevention of this ISR activation not only rescues memory formation in the PS19 mouse model of FTD, but also attenuates neuronal death, decreases tau phosphorylation and accumulation, and improves survival. Collectively, our data elucidates a novel mechanism by which mRNA translation is impaired early in neurodegeneration, identifies several pathological phenotypes which are traceable to impairments in mRNA translation, and highlights the therapeutic potential of rescuing these translational impairments.",

      "content": "Approximately 45% of new HIV infections worldwide occur in women and girls and adherence to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection is limited. Long-acting PrEP such as lenacapavir may improve adherence. One barrier to PrEP usage in women and girls is impact on the menstrual cycle, though impacts of long-acting PrEP are unclear. To model the effect of lenacapavir administration on cyclicity, adult female C57Bl/6J mice were injected with CA inhibitor 1 and assessed for estrous cyclicity. Ca inhibitor 1 transiently delayed the start of the next cycle. However, Ca inhibitor 1 was associated with a higher proportion of normal length estrous cycles. Ca inhibitor 1 did not impact astrocyte immunoreactivity or chronic cellular activity in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a major regulator of the estrous cycle. These findings suggest that lenacapavir may be a viable PrEP alternative for those concerned with PrEP impacts on menstrual cycle.",

      "title": "Stimulated human cortical waves: spatiotemporal dynamics across development",
      "content": "Traveling waves of neural activity are fundamental to cortical function, yet their spatiotemporal dynamics and structural constraints remain less understood in human brain. Conventional analyses focus on network topology and spatial geometry of neural signals, with limited emphasis on wave dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions. Here, we applied a manifold-based optical flow algorithm to an open-access intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) dataset from the single-pulse stimulation cortico-cortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) paradigm, enabling direct construction of high-temporal-resolution cortical neural activity velocity fields. Spatiotemporal mode decomposition revealed a hierarchical organization: large-scale plane waves (mediating global propagation) dominate, complemented by local patterns for local computation. Dominant plane wave directions correlate with underlying white matter fibre tract orientations, indicating anatomical guidance of cortical dynamics. Velocity field singularities (sources, sinks, spirals and saddles) are non-randomly distributed, associating with default mode network (DMN) hubs. We further identified a nonlinear relationship between cortical wave speed and age, with developmental phases paralleling white matter maturation and aging. Our findings link cortical wave dynamics to anatomy, functional networks, and neurodevelopment, establishing wave speed as a potential yet important biomarker for brain function and health.",

      "title": "Locomotor savings relies on attentional control of walking in older, but not younger adults",
      "content": "The ability to recall learned movements and rapidly adapt to environmental changes, known as locomotor savings, is crucial for mobility in community-dwelling older adults. However, the influence of aging on locomotor savings and the underlying mechanisms remains poorly understood. Attentional compensation is a particularly relevant mechanism because the control of automatic motor behaviors like walking tend to recruit more attentional/executive resources with aging. We hypothesize that locomotor savings is diminished with age and relies on attentional rather than automatic control of walking. To test this, we compared savings of a novel walking pattern learned on a split-belt treadmill, where each leg moves at a different speed, across multiple days in 21 older and 21 younger adults. Attentional control of walking was assessed by overground dual-task walking while prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity was recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We found that older adults exhibited less locomotor savings than younger adults after practice. Older adults also relied more on attentional resources during dual-task walking. Importantly, greater locomotor savings was associated with higher attentional control of walking in older adults, suggesting that the use of attentional resources during challenging walking facilitates the recall of previously learned movements. These results indicate that cognitive compensation strategies utilizing attentional resources are important neural mechanisms modulating locomotor savings. Understanding the role of cognitive compensation in locomotor savings may inform rehabilitation design to enhance mobility in older adults ensuring movement corrections practiced in clinical settings are saved for long-term benefit in daily life.",

      "content": "Realigning structural MR images to stereotactic AC-PC space is a standard procedure that enhances anatomical consistency both within and across neuroimaging studies, allowing for precise spatial localization and reliable cross-subject comparisons in both clinical and research contexts. However, different versions of AC-PC spaces, stemming from varying definitions of the AC-PC axis as outlined in common stereotactic atlases like Talairach and Schaltenbrand, often lead to discrepancies between the neurosurgical and neuroimaging communities. Manual realignment of structural MR images to the clinically used version of the AC-PC plane is often necessary to validate the results of automated methods or to realign the image when these methods fail. Furthermore, manual realignment provides a critical ground truth for the development of new automated tools. However, such manual interventions are typically performed in a non-standardised manner by domain experts who possess the specialized knowledge of neuroanatomy and neuroimaging required to ensure accurate alignment. To address these challenges, we have developed and validated a standardized protocol for manually realigning structural MR images to the clinically used Schaltenbrand AC-PC plane, using a set of visual criteria to ensure accurate realignment. This protocol can be used to manually align images, verify results, validate existing automated methods, or generate ground truth data for developing new automated techniques.",

      "title": "Odor Sampling Bags Enable Reliable Delivery of Controlled Odor Concentrations",
      "content": "Precise control of odorant concentration is essential for reliable olfactory research, yet existing odorant delivery methods often suffer from solvent interactions and dilution from ambient air, limiting stimulus consistency in olfactory research. We developed an odor sampling bag system using Nalophan plastic to create a closed headspace with air as the carrier medium, eliminating solvent-related variability and ambient air dilution. In two independent experiments, 15 trained panelists each rated the perceived intensity of seven concentrations of benzaldehyde and 2-heptanone using both gas-sampling bags and glass jars. Bags produced higher maximum perceptual intensities (p < 0.001) and greater test-retest reliability than jars (Experiment 1: r = 0.89 vs. 0.81, p < 0.001; Experiment 2: r = 0.86 vs. 0.72, p < 0.001). Notably, the two tested odorants showed different maximum intensities in bags (p < 0.001) but not jars (p = 0.85), suggesting bags better preserve odorant-specific concentration differences. Photoionization detector measurements confirmed stable headspace concentrations over time, comparable to industry-standard Tedlar bags. This cost-effective approach offers improved stimulus control for olfactory psychophysics research.",

      "title": "LRRK2 regulates ArfGAP1 membrane localization, activity and neuronal toxicity via phosphorylation within its lipid-sensing ALPS2 motif",
      "content": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene cause late-onset, autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 encodes a multi-domain protein containing a Roc GTPase domain and a serine/threonine-directed protein kinase domain, with PD-linked mutations known to enhance LRRK2 kinase activity and neuronal toxicity. Our previous studies identified the Golgi protein, ADP-Ribosylation Factor GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (ArfGAP1), as a novel modifier of LRRK2-induced cellular toxicity, where it can serve as a GAP-like protein and a robust kinase substrate of LRRK2. Here, we further explore the phosphorylation of ArfGAP1 by LRRK2 and its functional consequences. LRRK2 mediates the robust phosphorylation of ArfGAP1 within its lipid-sensing ALPS2 motif at residues Ser284, Thr291 and Thr292. We mutated these three phosphorylation sites, either alone or combined, to create hydrophobic phospho-null or charged phospho-mimicking versions of ArfGAP1. We find that modulating ArfGAP1 phosphorylation impairs its normal capacity to induce Golgi fragmentation upon overexpression in neural cells. Blocking phosphorylation impairs ArfGAP1-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition in primary neurons and protects against the neurotoxic effects of PD-linked G2019S LRRK2. ArfGAP1 interactome analysis in neural cells identifies 114 putative interacting proteins with a proportion of these unexpectedly localized to mitochondria, including the outer membrane proteins Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) 1-3. An ArfGAP1 triple phospho-mimic displays an increased interaction with mitochondrial VDACs owing to the redistribution of ArfGAP1 from the cis-Golgi to the cytoplasm. Promoting ArfGAP1 phosphorylation also blocks the formation of Golgi-derived vesicles following mild ER stress. Our data provides evidence for a complex functional interaction between LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 that serves to regulate ArfGAP1 subcellular localization, protein interactions, activity and neuronal toxicity via LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of its membrane-binding ALPS2 motif. Our findings support additional validation of ArfGAP1 as a putative therapeutic target for modulating LRRK2-linked PD.",

      "title": "Tilted striatofugal balance and beneficial effects of facilitating mGlu4 receptor activity in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome",
      "content": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To date, no approved pharmacological treatment alleviates social impairments in patients with FXS. Since D1 and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal projection neurons (SPNs) were shown to regulate ASD-sensitive behaviors, we explored whether the balance of activity between D1- and D2-SPNs would be biased in the Fmr1-/- mouse model of FXS. We evaluated striatal function in Fmr1-/- and Fmr1+/+ mice under pharmacological challenge and performed RNAscope(R) in situ hybridization following social interaction to assess the activity of SPNs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum (DS). We evidenced a decrease in D1-SPN activity, biasing the D1/D2-SPN balance towards an excessive weight of D2-SPN outputs. We then evaluated the effects of compounds that repress D2-SPN activity on behavioral impairments in Fmr1-/- mice. Systemically facilitating mGlu4 or blocking A2A receptor activity relieved behavioral deficits in this model. Finally, we tested the hypothesis that a tilt of the D1/D2-SPN balance in Fmr1-/- mice may contribute to their social deficit by facilitating mGlu4 activity directly in the projection site of NAc D2-SPNs. Social interaction in Fmr1-/- mice was fully rescued by photopharmacological activation of mGlu4 in the ventral pallidum (VP), where NAc D2-SPNs project. This result supports our hypothesis of excessive D2-SPN outputs and highlights the contribution of the VP in controlling social behavior. In conclusion, pharmacological compounds that repress D2-SPN activity demonstrate a promising therapeutic potential to relieve ASD-like deficits in FXS.",
