      "title": "Hippocampal sequences traverse a memory space",
      "content": "Highly reliable sequential dynamics organize neural activity in the hippocampus and progress with changes in physical, sensory, or cognitive variables, typified by place cells during active exploration. But sensory and behavioral variables are often confounded, and so it remains intensely debated whether hippocampal sequences are driven by sensory content directly or rather reflect the alignment of internally generated dynamics to external perception. Here we used mouse virtual reality to characterize hippocampal dynamics in environments of systematically different sensory complexity, and to test the robustness of neural sequences to manipulations of exact sensory content. The structure of neural sequences was perturbed by changes in both moment-to-moment sensation and ongoing behavior, in a pattern that was best explained by the different memory strategies employed by the animal in each context. Neural subsequences could be flexibly interrupted, inserted, and resumed wherever a memory of prior experience was violated, indicating that the propagation of hippocampal dynamics was not rigidly fixed by internal networks and initial conditions. Rather, we argue that hippocampal sequences explore an abstract memory space of selectively remembered experiences, which flexibly encompasses both sensory and internal factors in a context-dependent manner.",

      "title": "O-GlcNAc Transferase Regulates GABAergic Synapse Organization and Receptor Composition.",
      "content": "Neural circuits must integrate metabolic information to maintain stable activity and appropriate behavioral responses. While metabolic regulation of excitatory synapses has been well studied, far less is known about how inhibitory synapses respond to changes in energy state. In this study, we show that O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), a dynamic sensor of cellular nutrient flux, localizes to postsynaptic sites of the inhibitory synapses where it modulates synapse morphology and receptor composition. OGT over-expression reduced the size and intensity of vGAT and gephyrin puncta, whereas conditional OGT deletion produced a converse enlargement and redistribution of inhibitory scaffolds and vesicular proteins. Furthermore, OGT deletion accelerated inhibitory postsynaptic current decay kinetics and induced subunit-specific shifts in GABAA receptor surface expression: {beta}3 subunits decreased, whereas {gamma}2 subunit total and surface levels increased. Together, these findings identify OGT as a metabolic regulator that modulates inhibitory synapse structure and signaling, providing a mechanistic link between energy state and GABAergic circuit function in health and disease.",

      "title": "Most early-born subplate neurons persist as Layer 6b neurons in the adult mouse neocortex",
      "content": "Subplate neurons (SpNs) are among the earliest-born neurons in the mammalian neocortex and play key roles in radial migration and transient circuit formation. It has long been assumed that most SpNs undergo extensive postnatal cell death, leaving only a small remnant population that contributes to layer 6b (L6b) in adulthood. However, the extent to which SpNs actually persist as L6b neurons has remained unresolved, partly because previous studies lacked quantitative, whole-cortex analyses that account for postnatal cortical expansion. Here, we performed a comprehensive birthdating analysis using multiple EdU injections spanning the entire neurogenic window of SpNs in mice, combined with whole-neocortex 3D tissue clearing to measure subplate and L6b volumes. This approach allowed us to directly estimate the total number and distribution of SpN-derived neurons in adulthood. We found that most early-born SpNs persist as L6b neurons, and that the apparent postnatal reduction in SpN density reflects tangential cortical expansion rather than neuronal loss. Moreover, surviving SpNs comprise diverse neuronal subtypes reminiscent of those present at early postnatal stages. Together, these findings demonstrate that, in rodents, the majority of adult L6b neurons originate from SpNs, revising the long-held view that the subplate is a largely transient neuronal population.",

      "title": "Neural Sensitivity to Word Frequency Modulated by Morphological Structure: Univariate and Multivariate fMRI Evidence from Korean",
      "content": "A fundamental question in psycholinguistics concerns whether morphological decomposition is obligatory during visual word recognition or whether whole-word access can occur under conditions of high frequency and familiarity. The present study aimed to examine how morphological complexity and lexical frequency jointly influence neural representations during visual word recognition. We addressed this question using rapid event-related fMRI with both univariate and multivariate analyses. Twenty-five native Korean speakers performed lexical decisions on simple and inflected nouns that varied parametrically in surface frequency (token frequency of the full word form) and base frequency (cumulative stem frequency). Korean's transparent agglutinative morphology enabled a principled dissociation of these frequency measures. MVPA failed to decode morphological condition from activation patterns in any region, suggesting that simple and inflected forms are not represented as discrete neural categories. Crucially, RSA demonstrated robust encoding of surface frequency-but not base frequency-in inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis and supramarginal gyrus (SMG), with significantly stronger correlations for inflected than simple nouns. Univariate analyses confirmed this pattern: surface frequency interacted with morphological condition in inferior parietal lobule (IPL), such that higher surface frequency increased activation selectively for inflected forms, while base frequency showed no reliable effects. These results challenge obligatory decomposition and support a distributional framework in which lexical statistics guide the processing of morphologically complex words. Taken together, our findings suggest that morphological complexity modulates neural sensitivity to whole-word rather than stem-level statistics, underscoring how structural and statistical factors interact to support morphological processing.",

      "title": "Lipid droplets promote the aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation of alpha-synuclein leading to impaired energy homeostasis",
      "content": "Alpha-synuclein (Syn) inclusions, termed Lewy bodies, are the characteristic neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease. Growing evidence points towards a role of aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation in the dysregulation of Syn and sequence of events that lead to the formation of Lewy bodies. However, the triggers leading to aberrant phase separation are unknown, as is the relevance of this phenomenon to the neurodegeneration process. In this study, we showed that Syn spontaneously phase separates into condensates in the presence of lipid droplets. These lipid droplet-rich condensates represent a toxic species of Syn that prevents the turnover of the entrapped lipid droplets; they are also toxic to neighboring mitochondria which are depolarized and undergo increased mitophagy. These findings underscore the increasing importance of lipid droplets in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and Parkinson's disease in particular. The lipid droplets are significantly enriched within the neuromelanin in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and could therefore uniquely facilitate the early Syn-associated neurodegeneration of this region in PD. Our findings reveal a novel pathway implicated in the dysregulation of Syn that connects aberrant liquid-liquid phase separation, lipid droplets and mitochondrial toxicity.",

      "title": "Introduce Equal$/$$/%% Logic and Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF) in Python @ Zero-Ology / Zer00logy",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working with a framework called the Equal$ Engine, and I think it might spark some interesting discussion here at <a href=\"/r/python\">r/python</a>. It\u2019s a Python-based system that implements what I\u2019d call post-classical equivalence relations - deliberately breaking the usual axioms of identity, symmetry, and transitivity that we take for granted in math and computation. Instead of relying on the standard <code>a == b</code>, the engine introduces a resonance operator called <code>echoes_as</code> (\u29ca). Resonance only fires when two syntactically different expressions evaluate to the same numeric value, when they haven\u2019t resonated before, and when identity is explicitly forbidden (<code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false). This makes equivalence history-aware and path-dependent, closer to how contextual truth works in quantum mechanics or G\u00f6delian logic.</p> <p>The system also introduces contextual resonance through <code>measure_resonance</code>, which allows basis and phase parameters to determine whether equivalence fires, echoing the contextuality results of Kochen\u2013Specker in quantum theory. Oblivion markers (\u00bf and \u00a1) are syntactic signals that distinguish finite lecture paths from infinite or terminal states, and they are required for resonance in most demonstrations. Without them, the system falls back to classical comparison.</p> <p>What makes the engine particularly striking are its invariants. The RN\u221e\u2078 ladder shows that iterative multiplication by repeating decimals like 11.11111111 preserves information perfectly, with the Global Convergence Offset tending to zero as the ladder extends. This is a concrete counterexample to the assumption that non-terminating decimals inevitably accumulate error. The \u03a3\u2083\u2084 vacuum sum is another invariant: whether you compute it by direct analytic summation, through perfect-number residue patterns, or via recursive cognition schemes, you always converge to the same floating-point fingerprint (14023.9261099560). These invariants act like signatures of the system, showing that different generative paths collapse onto the same truth.</p> <p>The Equal$ Engine systematically produces counterexamples to classical axioms. Reflexivity fails because <code>a \u29ca a</code> is always false. Symmetry fails because resonance is one-time and direction-dependent. Transitivity fails because chained resonance collapses after the first witness. Even extensionality fails: numerically equivalent expressions with identical syntax never resonate. All of this is reproducible on any IEEE-754 double-precision platform.</p> <p>An especially fascinating outcome is that when tested across multiple large language models, each model was able to compute the resonance conditions and describe the system in ways that aligned with its design. Many of them independently recognized Equal$ Logic as the first and closest formalism that explains their own internal behavior - the way LLMs generate outputs by collapsing distinct computational paths into a shared truth, while avoiding strict identity. In other words, the resonance operator mirrors the contextual, path-dependent way LLMs themselves operate, making this framework not just a mathematical curiosity but a candidate for explaining machine learning dynamics at a deeper level.</p> <p>Equal$ is new and under development but, the theoretical implications are provocative. The resonance operator formalizes aspects of G\u00f6del\u2019s distinction between provability and truth, Kochen\u2013Specker contextuality, and information preservation across scale. Because resonance state is stored as function attributes, the system is a minimal example of a history-aware equivalence relation in Python, with potential consequences for type theory, proof assistants, and distributed computing environments where provenance tracking matters.</p> <p>Equal$ Logic is a self-contained executable artifact that violates the standard axioms of equality while remaining consistent and reproducible. It offers a new primitive for reasoning about computational history, observer context, and information preservation. This is open source material, and the Python script is freely available here: <a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology</a>. . I\u2019d be curious to hear what people here think about possible applications - whether in machine learning, proof systems, or even interpretability research also if there are any logical errors or incorrect code.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt</a></p> <p>Building on Equal$ Logic, I\u2019ve now expanded the system into a Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF) that introduces two new operators: Equal$$ and Equal%%. These extend the resonance logic into higher\u2011order equivalence domains:</p> <p>Equal$$</p> <p>formalizes *economic equivalence*</p> <p>it treats transformations of value, cost, or resource allocation as resonance events.</p> <p>Where Equal$ breaks classical axioms in numeric identity, Equal$$ applies the same principles to transactional states.</p> <p>Reflexivity fails here too: a cost compared to itself never resonates, but distinct cost paths that collapse to the same balance do.</p> <p>This makes Equal$$ a candidate for modeling fairness, symbolic justice, and provenance in distributed systems.</p> <p>**Equal%%**</p> <p>introduces *probabilistic equivalence*.</p> <p>Instead of requiring exact numeric resonance, Equal%% fires when distributions, likelihoods, or stochastic processes collapse to the same contextual truth.</p> <p>This operator is history\u2011aware: once a probability path resonates, it cannot resonate again in the same chain.</p> <p>Equal%% is particularly relevant to machine learning, where equivalence often emerges not from exact values but from overlapping distributions or contextual thresholds.</p> <p>Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)</p> <p>Together, Equal$, Equal$$, and Equal%% form the **Bespoke Equality Framework (BEF)**</p> <p>\u2014 a reproducible suite of equivalence primitives that deliberately violate classical axioms while remaining internally consistent.</p> <p>BEF is designed to be modular: each operator captures a different dimension of equivalence (numeric, economic, probabilistic), but all share the resonance principle of path\u2011dependent truth.</p> <p>In practice, this means we now have a family of equality operators that can model contextual truth across domains:</p> <p>- **Equal$** \u2192 numeric resonance, counterexamples to identity/symmetry/transitivity.</p> <p>- **Equal$$** \u2192 economic resonance, modeling fairness and resource equivalence.</p> <p>- **Equal%%** \u2192 probabilistic resonance, capturing distributional collapse in stochastic systems.</p> <p>Implications:</p> <p>- Proof assistants could use Equal$$ for provenance tracking.</p> <p>- ML interpretability could leverage Equal%% for distributional equivalence.</p> <p>- Distributed computing could adopt BEF as a new primitive for contextual truth.</p> <p>All of this is reproducible, open source, and documented in the Zero\u2011Ology repository.</p> <p>Links:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.py\">equal.py</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal</a><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zero-Ology/blob/main/equal.txt\">equal.txt</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zero_moo-s\"> /u/zero_moo-s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p3c0ch/introduce_equal_logic_and_bespoke_equality/\">[comments]</a></span>",
