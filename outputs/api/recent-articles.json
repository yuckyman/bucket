      "title": "Improving Calibration of EMG-Informed Neuromusculoskeletal Models Through Differentiable Physics and Muscle Synergies",
      "content": "Objective: Electromyogram (EMG)-informed neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) models can predict physiologically plausible muscle forces and joint moments. However, calibrating model parameters (e.g., optimal fiber length, tendon slack length) to the individual is time-consuming, with the optimization often requiring hours to converge and typically not accounting for unrecorded muscle excitations. This study addresses these limitations by incorporating differentiable physics and muscle synergies into the calibration of NMS models. Methods: We implemented an NMS model with auto-differentiable Hill-type muscles, enabling the use of adaptive gradient descent optimizers. Two types of calibration were evaluated: a standard EMG-driven approach and a synergy-hybrid approach that also synthesized unrecorded excitations. These methods were evaluated using upper and lower limb data, each from a single participant. Results: The calibration time was reduced by up to 26 times while maintaining comparable accuracy in joint moment predictions. Compared to the EMG-driven calibration, the synergy-hybrid calibration improved the estimates of model parameters for reduced number of EMG channels. Conclusion: Auto-differentiable Hill-type muscle models greatly reduce NMS model calibration time and enable the synthesis of unrecorded muscle excitations through muscle synergies, facilitating the calibration of all muscle parameters. Significance: This new rapid calibration could support deployment of NMS models in time-sensitive applications, including real-time biomechanical analyses and personalized neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Compression-Enabled Joint Entropy Estimation for Seizure Detection on Human Intracortical Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Objective: Of the 1% of the world population with epilepsy, one-third have drug-resistant epilepsy and often turn to surgical intervention. Current epilepsy treatment relies on manual review by epileptologists and could benefit from reliable quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) approaches to speed up evaluation, minimize inter-reviewer variance, and deliver higher quality and more equitable care. Methods: We present the inverse compression ratio (ICR), an estimate of an upper bound of joint entropy using common compression algorithms, as a potential qEEG method for seizure detection. This technique was tested on our repository of 10 kHz intracortical neurophysiological data across 30 participants (15 adults and 15 children, 240+ total seizures). Results: Single-electrode ICR achieved a F1 score of 0.80 and an area under precision-recall curve of 0.69, outperforming conventional qEEG methods. Multielectrode ICR performed within the top 2% of individual electrodes, potentially eliminating the need for electrode selection. Conclusion: ICR may be useful for automated seizure detection; its integration into clinical systems may translate to broad clinical impact. Significance: We believe this clinical study analyzed the largest volume of continuous, multi-day intracortical neuroelectrophysiology for quantitative methods\u2013with 2,900+ recording hours (420,000+ electrode-hours, amounting to 30+ TB of data). It is also the first demonstration of compression-based multidimensional estimation in a biological or clinical application. By computing an ensemble effect without linear assumptions or parametric modeling, ICR offers a model-free solution to the classically combinatorially intractable problem of high-dimensional joint entropy; its application likely extends beyond epilepsy to other domains of biomedical signal processing.",

      "title": "Connectomic mapping of pharyngeal and gut sensory circuits in adult Drosophila",
      "content": "Feeding is regulated by both external sensory signals, such as taste, and internal sensory signals originating from the pharynx and gut. The recent completion of the Full Adult Fly Brain (FAFB) connectome offers an opportunity to map these sensory inputs and their downstream circuits. While the external gustatory receptor neurons have been relatively well characterized, the internal pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons remain less understood. Here, we systemically identify their axonal projections in the FAFB connectome and examine their downstream circuits. We find that the stomodeal nerve, which carries afferent signals from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, contains multiple types of sensory axons with distinct morphology and downstream output connections. In addition, we identify sensory axons derived from different pharyngeal sense organs and find that chemosensory and mechanosensory axons arborize in distinct regions of the subesophageal zone. Characterization of the second- and third-order neurons reveals the major brain regions that receive input from pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons. Interestingly, a subset of these internal sensory neurons forms monosynaptic connections with various motor neurons and endocrine cells, suggesting that internal signals from the pharynx and gut may directly influence feeding-related motor programs and endocrine output. Together, our study delineates the pharyngeal and gut sensory circuits, laying a foundation for future studies on how internal sensory signals regulate feeding behavior and endocrine functions.",

      "title": "Robust automated preclinical fMRI preprocessing via a multi-stage dilated convolutional Swin Transformer affine registration",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is crucial for effective analysis in preclinical studies. Key steps such as denoising, skull-stripping, and affine registration are essential to align fMRI data with a standard atlas. However, challenges such as low resolution, variations in brain geometry, and limited dataset sizes often hinder the performance of traditional and deep learning-based methods.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a preclinical fMRI preprocessing pipeline that integrates advanced deep learning modules, with a particular focus on a newly developed Swin Transformer-based affine registration method. The pipeline incorporates our previously established modules for 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based denoising and Transformer-based skull stripping, followed by the proposed Multi-stage Dilated Convolutional Swin Transformer (MsDCSwinT) for affine registration. This new registration method captures both local and global spatial misalignments, ensuring accurate alignment with a standard atlas even in challenging preclinical datasets.ResultsWe validate the pipeline across multiple preclinical fMRI studies and demonstrate that our affine registration module achieves higher average Dice similarity coefficients compared to state-of-the-art methods.DiscussionBy leveraging GANs and Transformers, our pipeline offers a robust, accurate, and fully automated solution for preclinical fMRI.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "High-Fidelity Tuning of Olfactory Mixture Distances in the Perceptual Space of Smell Through a Community Effort",
      "content": "A central goal in sensory science is to establish quantitative mappings between physical stimuli and perceptual responses. While such mappings are well characterized in vision and audition, they remain poorly defined in olfaction, limiting progress toward understanding the representations of smell. Predicting perceptual similarity between odor mixtures offers a promising route to formalize these relationships. To advance this effort, the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Olfactory Mixtures Prediction Challenge assembled a curated, cross-study dataset describing the similarity of 507 mixture pairs and an unpublished test set of 46 mixture pairs. Teams competed to predict the perceptual similarity of mixture pairs, and then collaborated post-challenge to create an ensemble combining top-performing models that notably improves predictions over the existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, ensemble model maintains high predictive accuracy in novel validation set. Our model provides a reproducible framework for neuroscientists, chemists, and engineers to compare odor mixtures and provides a foundation for future efforts towards better understanding the olfactory properties of mixtures.",

      "title": "From labels to latents: revealing state-dependent hippocampal computations with Jump Latent Variable Model",
      "content": "Neural activity is usually interpreted by imposing external labels (e.g., stimuli or position during locomotion) and decoding within that space (e.g. replay). While powerful, such supervision can mask structure in the data that do not correspond to the label. Unsupervised methods, in turn, often assume smooth latent dynamics and miss genuine discontinuities. We introduce a conceptually simple, computationally efficient latent variable model that infers both (i) the latent variables organizing population activity and (ii) whether their dynamics are continuous or fragmented in time. Fitting reduces to an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure that alternates two operations familiar to systems neuroscience--tuning-curve estimation and label decoding--without requiring external labels. Applied to rodent hippocampal spike recordings, the model reveals distinct population patterns at the same physical position that supervised spatial decoding fails to detect. While learned latents exhibit place-field-like tuning, their reactivation patterns are better distinguished by behavioral states. The model further identifies a continuity-fragmentation axis that characterizes population activities across sleep-wake brain states that is modulated by cholinergic inputs. By not relying on externally imposed spatial labels, our approach exposes structure that supervised approaches obscure and provides a powerful tool for datasets lacking behavioral tracking.",

      "title": "Whole-brain connectomics of Drosophila reveals a robust, distributed architecture for the suppression of feeding during escape",
      "content": "Survival demands instant prioritization of escape over maintenance. To decode the dynamic logic embedded in the static Drosophila connectome (FlyWire v783), we simulated the conflict between predator-evasion, feeding, and grooming to uncover the logic of this switch. We show that escape is a holistic state defined by distributed robustness: it is reliably triggered by only a fraction of visual inputs (LC4/LPLC2) and induces a system-wide pause on behaviors like feeding and grooming. Within this global suppression, we identify a specialized, fail-safe architecture for arresting feeding. A redundant ensemble of neurons (DNge031/CB0565) targets the premotor center Roundup, effectively disfacilitating motor output. Crucially, this inhibition is modular, anatomically distinct from grooming suppression, and relies on additive logic to ensure suppression even if individual components fail. Our results demonstrate how connectome topology implements robust, survival-critical control through distributed neural architecture.",

      "title": "It's All In The Journey: Putative Strategies Extracted from Navigation Paths Predict Spatial Memory and Hippocampal Recruitment",
      "content": "Navigation in the real world may rely on a multitude of different strategies with distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, the characterization of spontaneous strategy use during wayfinding and underlying neural correlates are scarce. We explore data across three groups of participants who performed a virtual navigation task: (I) epilepsy patients undergoing invasive electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampus, and two groups who underwent fMRI scanning: (II) young adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (APOE-e4 carriers) and (III) healthy controls. We establish three metrics by which to quantitatively characterize each taken path, with the aim of simultaneously reflecting the putative strategies used by humans to solve the task: 1. straightness of paths; 2. deviation towards the edge of the circular arena; and 3. overlap of individual paths leading to a specific object location, which putatively relate to reliance on allocentric (1) and egocentric reference frames (2 & 3). Extracted metrics were related to performance in the task and to hippocampal activity. We find that strategy use is variable within participant, changes across the experiment, and is adaptive in a group-dependent manner. While hippocampal BOLD activity and theta (gamma) power were generally inversely (positively) related, we found that the recruitment of the hippocampus was both group- and strategy- specific. Our results further our understanding of the heterogeneous and idiosyncratic nature of spatial navigation by revealing how these behaviors are altered by disease and the subsequent compensatory neural dynamics, as well as the link between mesoscopic and macroscopic neural signals.",
