      "title": "[Project] Pyrium \u2013 A Server-Side Meta-Loader & VM: Script your server in Python",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to share a project I\u2019ve been developing called <strong>Pyrium</strong>. It\u2019s a server-side meta-loader designed to bring the ease of Python to Minecraft server modding, but with a focus on performance and safety that you usually don't see in scripting solutions.</p> <h1>\ud83d\ude80 &quot;Wait, isn't Python slow?&quot;</h1> <p>That\u2019s the first question everyone asks. Pyrium does <strong>not</strong> run a slow CPython interpreter inside your server. Instead, it uses a custom <strong>Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler</strong> that translates Python code into a specialized instruction set called <strong>PyBC (Pyrium Bytecode)</strong>.</p> <p>This bytecode is then executed by a highly optimized, Java-based <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> running inside the JVM. This means you get Python\u2019s clean syntax but with execution speeds much closer to native Java/Lua, without the overhead of heavy inter-process communication.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Why use a VM-based approach?</h1> <p>Most server-side scripts (like Skript or Denizen) or raw Java mods can bring down your entire server if they hit an infinite loop or a memory leak.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sandboxing:</strong> Every Pyrium mod runs in its own isolated VM instance.</li> <li><strong>Determinism:</strong> The VM can monitor instruction counts. If a mod starts &quot;misbehaving,&quot; the VM can halt it without affecting the main server thread.</li> <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Mods are isolated from the JVM and each other.</li> </ul> <h1>\ud83c\udfa8 Automatic Asset Management (The ResourcePackBuilder)</h1> <p>One of the biggest pains in server-side modding is managing textures. Pyrium includes a <a href=\"http://ResourcePackBuilder.java\"><strong>ResourcePackBuilder.java</strong></a> that:</p> <ol> <li>Scans your mod folders for <code>/assets</code>.</li> <li>Automatically handles <strong>namespacing</strong> (e.g., <code>pyrium:my_mod/textures/...</code>).</li> <li>Merges everything into a single ZIP and handles delivery to the clients. No manual ZIP-mashing required.</li> </ol> <h1>\u2699\ufe0f Orchestration via JSON</h1> <p>You don\u2019t have to mess with shell scripts to manage your server versions. Your <code>mc_version.json</code> defines everything:</p> <p>JSON</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;base_loader&quot;: &quot;paper&quot;, // or forge, fabric, vanilla &quot;source&quot;: &quot;mojang&quot;, &quot;auto_update&quot;: true, &quot;resource_pack_policy&quot;: &quot;lock&quot; } </code></pre> <p>Pyrium acts as a manager, pulling the right artifacts and keeping them updated.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udcbb Example: Simple Event Logic</h1> <p>Python</p> <pre><code>def on_player_join(player): broadcast(f&quot;Welcome {player} to the server!&quot;) give_item(player, &quot;minecraft:bread&quot;, 5) def on_block_break(player, block, pos): if block == &quot;minecraft:diamond_ore&quot;: log(f&quot;Alert: {player} found diamonds at {pos}&quot;) </code></pre> <h1>Current Status</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Phase:</strong> Pre-Alpha / Experimental.</li> <li><strong>Instruction Set:</strong> ~200 OpCodes implemented (World, Entities, NBT, Scoreboards).</li> <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Works with Vanilla, Paper, Fabric, and Forge.</li> </ul> <p>I built this because I wanted a way to add custom server logic in seconds without setting up a full Java IDE or worrying about a single typo crashing my 20-player lobby.</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/CrimsonDemon567/Pyrium/\">https://github.com/CrimsonDemon567/Pyrium/</a> </p> <p><strong>Pyrium Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://pyrium.gamer.gd\">https://pyrium.gamer.gd</a></p> <p><strong>Mod Author Guide:</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR-EkS9n32URj-EjV31eqU-bks91oviIaizPN57kJm9uFE1kqo2O9hWEl9FdiXTtfpBt-zEPxwA20R8/pub\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR-EkS9n32URj-EjV31eqU-bks91oviIaizPN57kJm9uFE1kqo2O9hWEl9FdiXTtfpBt-zEPxwA20R8/pub</a></p> <p>I'd love to hear some feedback from fellow admins\u2014especially regarding the VM-sandbox approach for custom mini-games or event logic.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry_Philosophy_6825\"> /u/Dry_Philosophy_6825 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1prasf0/project_pyrium_a_serverside_metaloader_vm_script/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1prasf0/project_pyrium_a_serverside_metaloader_vm_script/\">[comments]</a></span>",

UML can.</li> <li><strong>VS Monkey Patching:</strong> Standard monkey patching replaces the entire function object. If you only want to change one line or a local variable, you usually have to copy-paste the whole function, which breaks compatibility. UML injects only the necessary logic into the existing AST.</li> <li><strong>VS Other Languages:</strong> This brings the <strong>&quot;Mixin&quot; (Java/Minecraft)</strong> or <strong>&quot;Harmony&quot; (C#/Unity)</strong> style of modding to Python, which has been largely missing in the ecosystem.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The &quot;Magic&quot; (Example)</strong></p> <p>Let's say you have a function with <strong>a local value that is impossible to control from the outside</strong>:</p> <pre><code># target.py import random def attack(self): # The dice roll happens INSIDE the function. # Standard decorators cannot touch this local 'roll' variable. roll = random.randint(1, 100) if roll == 100: print(&quot;Critical Hit!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Miss...&quot;) </code></pre> <p>With my loader, you can intercept the <code>randint</code> call and <strong>force its return value to 100</strong>, guaranteeing a Critical Hit:</p> <pre><code># mods/your_mod.py import universal_modloader as uml # Hook AFTER 'randint' is called, but BEFORE the 'if' check @uml.Inject(&quot;target&quot;, &quot;attack&quot;, at=uml.At.INVOKE(&quot;randint&quot;, shift=uml.Shift.AFTER)) def force_luck(ctx): # Overwrite the return value of randint() ctx['__return__'] = 100 </code></pre> <p><strong>What else can it do?</strong></p> <p>I've included several examples in the repository:</p> <ul> <li><strong>FastAPI (Security)</strong>: Dumping plaintext passwords and bypassing authentication.</li> <li><strong>Tkinter (GUI)</strong>: Modernizing legacy apps with theme injection and widget overlays.</li> <li><strong>Pandas (Data Engineering)</strong>: Injecting progress bars and timers without adding dependencies.</li> <li><strong>CLI Games</strong>: Implementing &quot;God Mode&quot; and &quot;Speedhacks&quot;.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Zero Setup</strong></p> <p>No <code>pip install</code> required for the target.
