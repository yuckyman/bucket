      "title": "Dendritic delay lines shape the computation of sound location in neurons of the gerbil medial superior olive",
      "content": "In mammals, neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO) encode information about sounds arising from discrete spatial locations along the horizon. This tuning requires that an internal delay in the brain must offset acoustic disparities to ensure coincident arrival of excitatory inputs driven from the two ears. The source of this internal delay, originally assumed to arise from axonal delay lines, is currently controversial in mammals. Here we use 2-photon guided paired dendritic and somatic recordings together with compartmental modeling of 40 complete MSO neuron morphologies to demonstrate that the dendrites themselves serve as a significant source of internal delay. We show that most MSO neurons exhibit morphological asymmetries that impose different EPSP delays across dendrites and shifts in optimal interaural time differences. Dendrite-based delays in the mammalian MSO are heterogeneous within each isofrequency laminae and provide a stable, structural mechanism to help tune individual neurons to sounds from different azimuthal locations.",

      "title": "mPFC Synaptosome Proteomics Reveals Novel Pathways and Muscarinic Receptor Changes in a Learned Helplessness Mouse Model",
      "content": "Stressful events are a leading factor in development of depression. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is strongly associated with depression etiology and exposure to uncontrollable stressors results in synaptic dysfunction and loss. Learned helplessness is a behavioral paradigm that measures effects of repeated exposure to uncontrollable, inescapable stress on later responses to escapable stress. We therefore performed a proteomic analysis of mPFC synaptosomes in a mouse learned helplessness model to identify molecular changes that could contribute to functional consequences of inescapable stress. Male and female mice were evaluated at baseline and following exposure to escapable or inescapable stress followed by an active avoidance test. Label-free mass spectrometry followed by pathway and protein-protein interaction network analyses identified alterations in signaling pathways involved in energy metabolism, neurotransmitter signaling, and protein shuttling. Furthermore, phosphoproteomics revealed alterations related to synaptic function, neurotransmitter signaling and protein internalization, as well as changes in activity of kinases previously identified as mediators of antidepressant efficacy (GSK3B) and receptor internalization (ADRBK1). We more deeply examined alterations in the Acetylcholine Receptor Signaling Pathway, and identified muscarinic receptor proteins (Chrm1, Chrm2, Chrm4) and key proteins involved in their translocation to and from the membrane. These results identify substantial changes in the mPFC proteome following exposure to inescapable stressors. In addition, mPFC muscarinic cholinergic signaling is well placed to mediate responses to an inescapable stressor. This proteomic study will be useful in guiding studies of human mPFC relevant to depression. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD073765.",

      "title": "Intrinsic Circadian Organization of the Spinal Cord and Dorsal Root Ganglia",
      "content": "Circadian rhythms coordinate daily fluctuations in physiology and behavior, yet their organization within primary sensory pathways remains poorly defined. Although somatosensory responsiveness varies across the day night cycle, it is unclear whether peripheral sensory circuits possess molecular mechanisms for temporal regulation. Here, we demonstrate that the spinal peripheral sensory axis harbors robust, tissue autonomous circadian clocks. Using real time bioluminescence imaging, we observed sustained oscillations of the core clock protein PER2 in the spinal dorsal horn and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), indicating autonomous circadian timing within these tissues. To define the molecular scope of this regulation, we performed RNA sequencing across a 52 hours circadian time course in DRGs. Circadian analysis identified 626 rhythmic transcripts, representing 3.6% of expressed genes. These genes exhibited non uniform phase distributions and segregated into discrete temporal clusters. Functional annotation revealed phase specific enrichment of biological processes related to transport, neuronal structure, and proteostasis, suggesting coordinated temporal deployment of distinct molecular programs rather than uniform oscillations across the circadian cycle. Cross referencing circadian genes with neuropathic pain associated gene sets revealed limited overlap; however, overlapping genes aligned to specific baseline phase windows enriched for regenerative annotations. Potassium channel related signaling components implicated in neuropathic pain also showed baseline circadian modulation. Together, these findings establish the spinal dorsal horn and DRGs as intrinsically circadian tissues and reveal a temporally structured molecular landscape in primary sensory neurons, providing a framework for understanding how peripheral sensory processing, plasticity, and homeostatic regulation are coordinated across the day night cycle.",
