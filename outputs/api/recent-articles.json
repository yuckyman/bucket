      "title": "Foundation Model for Advancing Healthcare: Challenges, Opportunities and Future Directions",
      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "title": "SEIZURE OCCURRENCE IN FCD TYPE II IS PREDICTED BY LESION POSITION AND LINKED TO CYTOARCHITECTURAL ALTERATIONS",
      "content": "Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a common malformation of cortical development and a major cause of early-onset, drug-resistant epilepsy. FCD type II is defined by abnormal lamination, altered cellular composition, and pathological cells, notably dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and balloon cells. DNs are thought to drive epileptogenicity through both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, the latter including not only aberrant connectivity but also indirect modulation of excitability in local cell populations. We performed a multiscale structural and morphological analysis to elucidate the basis of FCD epileptogenicity and the impact of somatic mTOR mutations during brain development. Using a mouse model of FCD type II, we show that lesions in frontal and motor cortical regions are the strongest predictors of spontaneous seizure occurrence. This localization-dependent epileptogenicity offers an experimental explanation for the higher clinical epileptogenicity of frontal FCDs and suggests that posterior lesions may remain silent - an open question in human pathology. In our model, FCD tissue displayed considerable expansion, with cortical thickness up to ~20% in seizure-bearing animals. This expansion coincided with an overall ~40% reduction in neuronal density, consistent with tissue hypertrophy. DN density did not differ between seizure and non-seizure animals, challenging the notion that higher DN load directly predicts epileptogenesis. At the microscopic level, we describe DN axonal pathologies, including giant varicosities. In the cortex, these appeared as vesicle-filled boutons, whereas along callosal axons they were frequent but largely empty. Bouton density was markedly reduced in FCD cortex. Together, these findings leave the net synaptic effect of dysmorphic neurons unresolved, challenging the assumption that axonal hypertrophy translates into increased excitatory drive. While morphological abnormalities in FCD type II are well documented, their functional consequences remain incompletely understood. Here, we used macro- and microscopic structural features of FCDII to assess seizure susceptibility, providing new insights into epileptogenesis.",

      "content": "Caregiving alters the mammalian brain to support infant survival. While hypothalamic circuits are known to drive innate parental behaviors, information about the effect of parenthood on sensory processing and perception remain scarce, especially in fathers. We longitudinally imaged the same neurons in male mouse primary auditory cortex (ACx) before, during, and after fatherhood using two-photon calcium imaging. Behaviorally, males shifted from pup-directed aggression and self-oriented behaviors to transient parental care. In ACx, fathers showed enhanced and faster discrimination of pup ultrasonic vocalizations compared with matched narrowband noise. Slice electrophysiology revealed increased intrinsic excitability accompanies fatherhood. Mechanistically, we found elevated prolactin signaling in ACx, and manipulating prolactin levels modified the improvement in neuronal discriminability. Together, these results identify, in males, cortical plasticity and link prolactin to experience-dependent plasticity of sensory circuits that support caregiving. Our findings outline a father-specific mechanism that differs in key aspects from similar mechanisms in mothers.",

      "title": "Spatiotemporal representations of contextual associations for real-world objects",
      "content": "In the real world, objects always appear in context. Many objects are reliably associated with a certain scene context (e.g., pots appear in kitchens) and other objects that appear in the same context (e.g., pans appear together with pots). Previous neuroimaging work suggests that such contextual associations shape the neural representation of isolated objects even in the absence of the scene context. Yet, three key questions remain unanswered: (1) How do representations of contextual associations relate to perceptual and categorical representation in visual cortex, (2) how do they emerge across time, and (3) how are they mechanistically implemented? To answer these questions, we recorded fMRI and EEG while participants (human, both sexes) viewed isolated objects stemming from two scene contexts. Multivariate pattern analysis on the neural data revealed that objects from the same context were coded more similarly than objects from different contexts in object-selective LOC and scene-selective PPA, even when systematically controlling for perceptual and categorical similarities. Such contextual relation representations emerged relatively late during visual processing (i.e., after perceptual and categorical representations), specifically in the anterior PPA, and likely through a mixture of object-to-object and object-to-scene associations. Together, our results demonstrate that contextual relation representations emerged for isolated objects, and without a task that encourages their formation, suggesting that objects automatically activate context frames that support visual cognition in real-world environments.",

      "title": "Direction Selectivity in Naturalistic Action Observation: Distributed Representations Across the Action Observation Network",
      "content": "Perceiving the direction of observed actions is critical for interpreting intentions and guiding social interaction. While direction selectivity has been extensively studied with simple stimuli such as dots, gratings, or point-light displays (PLDs), little is known about how the brain encodes direction in naturalistic, repetitive actions that are seen frequently in daily life. The present fMRI study investigated direction-selective representations during observation of complex actions performed along three bidirectional dimensions (left-right, up-down, front-back) within a 96-video stimulus set. The brain activity was analyzed using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and multiple regression representational similarity analysis (RSA). MVPA revealed above-chance classification of action direction across occipital, parietal, and motor cortices, with the highest decoding in occipital, primary motor, and somatosensory regions. Crucially, RSA demonstrated that when accounting for low-level and motor features, direction information was still represented in early visual cortex, occipito-temporal areas, parietal regions, and motor-related regions. These findings indicate that action direction is represented across multiple levels of the action observation network (AON), extending from early sensory regions to higher-order parietal and frontal cortices. By using naturalistic, repetitive action videos, this study provides new evidence that the coding of action direction in the human brain is broadly distributed, reflecting the complexity of perceiving actions in everyday life. These findings suggest that direction selectivity is a core feature of the action observation network, linking basic motion processing with higher-level action understanding.",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

Due to its long-term consequences, there is also an expanding interest in adult-onset myopia. This review provides a comprehensive summary of interventions for slowing the onset and progression of myopia and discusses factors influencing their efficacy. Outdoor time is an effective intervention for at-risk pre-myopes, which can reduce myopia onset by up to 50% and has been implemented on a large scale...",

      "content": "Non-human primates (NHPs) are a crucial model for studying glaucoma because of their similarities to humans in anatomy, physiology and pathology. Our goal in this study was to quantify in vivo NHP lamina cribrosa (LC) shapes at low, normal, and elevated intraocular pressures (IOPs), and compare them with literature reported values for in vivo human LCs. We imaged the optic nerve heads (ONH) of seven eyes from six rhesus macaque monkeys using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)...",

The severe adversity, parental conflict, and low adversity groups showed no reliable predictions to cognition or cognitive status. These findings highlight the need for careful consideration of timing, measurement, and potential adaptive mechanisms when examining inflammatory pathways that associate childhood adversity with cognitive aging in older Black adults.",
