      "content": "Zone-like states, defined as high objective performance with low subjective workload, are sought in esports and other demanding digital activities, yet subjective flow does not consistently index efficient performance. We hypothesized that zone-like high performance is supported by regulated arousal dynamics rather than strongly elevated arousal responses, and that such episodes can be detected from the combined dynamics of heart rate and pupil diameter. Fourteen healthy young adult men completed repeated sessions of a one-versus-one fighting game under three contexts: passive watching, play against a computer-controlled opponent, and competition against a human opponent. Heart rate and pupil diameter were recorded continuously, and subjective flow (Sports Flow Scale), subjective workload (NASA Task Load Index), and in-game performance metrics were assessed. Two-dimensional k-means clustering of heart rate and pupil changes relative to the watching condition revealed three arousal-reactivity profiles. Sessions with larger physiological deviations showed higher flow and higher workload but poorer performance. Sessions with smaller deviations showed higher performance with lower workload despite only moderate flow. Nonlinear analyses indicated inverted-U relationships between physiological deviations and performance, with peak performance occurring when heart rate and pupil responses remained close to the watching baseline during active play. These findings indicate that combined heart rate and pupillometry measures provide a useful multimodal physiological marker for identifying efficient high-performance states and for informing strategies to support performance while managing workload in cognitively demanding digital activities.",

      "title": "Aerobic Exercise Preserves Capillary Oxygen Homeostasis and Neurovascular Function in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a critical contributor to cognitive decline and Alzheimers disease (AD) progression, yet the extent to which lifestyle interventions preserve microvascular oxygen delivery remains poorly defined. Physical activity (PA) improves vascular health and cognition in humans, but its impact on capillary-level oxygenation and functional hyperemia during aging and amyloid pathology is unknown. Here, we longitudinally quantified microvascular oxygen tension and stimulus-evoked oxygen dynamics in awake APP/PS1 mice and wild-type littermates using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy. Chronic aerobic PA initiated in early adulthood preserved basal arteriolar, capillary, and venular oxygenation, prevented age-dependent increases in microvascular heterogeneity, and mitigated excessive oxygen extraction in preclinical AD mice. While amyloid pathology impaired stimulus-evoked oxygen responses across vascular compartments, PA selectively enhanced capillary dilation and accelerated hyperemic kinetics without altering vascular density or architecture. Notably, sedentary AD mice developed widespread capillary hypoxia and bimodal oxygen distributions, hallmarks of malignant microvascular dysfunction, which were largely absent in physically active animals. These findings demonstrate that routine aerobic PA preserves microvascular oxygen homeostasis and functional responsiveness during aging and amyloid accumulation, supporting a capillary-centric mechanism through which exercise confers neurovascular resilience in preclinical AD.",

      "title": "Reproductive history differentially shapes the neural response of middle-aged females to estradiol therapy after a metabolic challenge",
      "content": "Background: Advancing age, the APOEe4 allele, and female sex are the top nonmodifiable risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD). Female-specific experiences, such as parity and hormone therapy (HT) affect aging biomarkers such as metabolism and immune signaling and may even affect AD risk. Estradiol (E2), a common component of many HTs, affects cognition and brain health in aging females although this may vary depending on parity, genotype, and metabolic status. We hypothesized that prior parity influences brain and metabolic health, including response to E2, depending on APOE genotype. Methods: Middle-aged female (10 month) wildtype (WT) or humanized (h) APOEe3 or e4 expressing rats, with different reproductive experience (nulliparous or primiparous) were fed a Western (WD) or standard diet (SD) for 2 months. In the second month, rats were given E2 or vehicle (oil) injections daily. Fear associative learning, plasma metabolic hormones, hippocampal inflammatory signalling, and neuroplasticity (neurogenesis, synaptic protein) were assessed. Results: Females fed a WD gained weight and displayed metabolic dysregulation, regardless of genotype. E2 treatment reduced WD-induced weight gain and reduced metabolic hormones, with stronger effects in WT rats. E2 treatment increased dorsal hippocampal inflammatory signalling selectively in primiparous hAPOEe4 females fed a WD. Previous parity increased neurogenesis and reduced certain cytokines in the hippocampus of middle-aged WT rats under a SD. Both E2 treatment and previous parity decreased dorsal neurogenesis in hippocampus of hAPOEe4 rats. In hAPOEe4 females, higher weight was associated with reduced contextual fear memory, an effect driven by primiparous females. In the cued fear conditioning task, hAPOEe4 females displayed better cued fear memory than WT, however, WD exposure reduced cued fear memory in this group. Together, this indicates that diet and weight gain may be more detrimental to associative memory in hAPOEe4 females and that E2 treatment has more favourable outcomes in WT rats. Conclusions: Previous parity alters how females respond to E2 and metabolic stress in midlife. Primiparous hAPOEe4 females were especially vulnerable to the effects of WD and E2, exhibiting more inflammation, impaired memory, and reduced weight-loss. These findings highlight the importance of considering parity and genotype when evaluating midlife metabolic and cognitive risk.",

      "title": "Systematic fMRI signal differences across cohorts alter lifespan connectome trajectories",
      "content": "Large-scale lifespan neuroimaging studies increasingly integrate data across distinct cohorts to characterize trajectories of brain development and aging. However, systematic differences in acquisition protocols and hardware across cohorts can alter signal characteristics in ways that bias downstream analyses. Here we examine three cohorts from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), spanning development (HCP-D), young adulthood (HCP-YA) and aging samples (HCP-A), to illustrate this issue and evaluate existing strategies to mitigate it. HCP has set standards for open, deeply phenotyped, high-resolution human neuroimaging, which are frequently used as high-quality reference datasets in tool validation, replication studies, and cross-cohort meta-analyses. Because of HCP's widespread usage, even modest protocol differences between cohorts-and their downstream effects-can have outsized impacts on the field of neuroscience research. Our analysis reveals that the HCP-YA cohort exhibits systematically weaker temporal signal-to-noise-ratio (tSNR) relative to HCP-D/A. These signal quality discrepancies propagate to downstream analyses, leading to differences in overall resting-state functional correlations, and whole-brain and node-level measures of resting-state network organization (e.g., system segregation, modularity, participation coefficient). Consistent with protocol-driven signal differences, resting-state network measures derived from HCP-YA depart from expected lifespan trajectories, as confirmed by examination of two other lifespan datasets. Harmonization approaches accounting for protocol and scanner-model differences alleviate some of the artifactual differences in brain network measurement. Our findings underscore that signal differences do not merely introduce noise, but can qualitatively alter estimated lifespan trajectories of functional network organization, including partially inverting expected lifespan patterns. Without appropriate harmonization, analyses that combine HCP cohorts can therefore result in biologically misleading inferences about development and aging. We demonstrate how small acquisition differences bias resting-state-derived network metrics, and how these effects can be mitigated. This work advances best practices for valid inferences in multi-cohort lifespan neuroscience research.",

      "title": "Small RNA sequencing of human sural nerves identifies widespread microRNA dysregulation and Schwann cell-localized miR-21-5p in diabetic peripheral neuropathy",
      "content": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of diabetes with no disease modifying treatments. Despite the prevalence, the molecular mechanisms of DPN are not fully characterized. Among the various molecular regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) control protein synthesis and are essential for normal development and homeostasis, with dysregulation implicated in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we performed small RNA-sequencing to profile the miRNA landscape of human sural nerves from individuals with and without DPN. Our analysis revealed that nearly 10% of all miRNAs detected are dysregulated and among those 74% are significantly downregulated in DPN. Target gene enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs yielded pathways significantly associated with nerve regeneration, metabolic dysfunction, and immune cell activity. In particular, miR-21-5p is significantly upregulated in DPN, showed a positive association with axonal loss severity, and localizes to Schwann cells, consistent with its broader role as an injury- and inflammation-responsive miRNA that shifts from early pro-regenerative functions to maladaptive, inflammation-amplifying effects that impair Schwann cell mediated nerve repair. These results suggest that miRNAs may contribute to peripheral nerve degeneration by promoting inflammation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and impaired nerve regeneration, while also opening potential avenues for biomarker discovery and therapeutic intervention.",

      "title": "Efferent projections of topographically distinct relaxin family peptide receptor-3 (RXFP3) lateral hypothalamus/zona incerta cells",
      "content": "Relaxin family peptide receptor-3 (RXFP3) is a ligand-activated G-protein coupled receptor and the cognate receptor for the conserved neuropeptide relaxin-3. We recently demonstrated that chemogenetically activating an RXFP3-expressing population in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta (LH/ZIRXFP3) induced escape-like jumping behaviour following fear conditioning, but only in a subset of mice. Given the diverse hodology of the LH and ZI, we hypothesised that LH/ZIRXFP3 cells may consist of discrete subpopulations with unique connectivity patterns that govern different aspects of defensive behaviour. To explore this possibility, we unilaterally injected small volumes of a Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracer into four distinct sites of the LH/ZI in RXFP3-Cre mice and analysed their brain-wide efferent connectivity patterns. Each injection site group produced unique projection patterns, particularly to nuclei involved in threat and defensive behaviour. Of note were strong projections from the rostral ZI and anterior LH to the lateral habenula, and projections from the intermediate and caudal ZI to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. By combining retrograde tracing and RNAscope fluorescent in situ hybridisation, we identified that most LH/ZIRXFP3 projections to the lateral habenula arose from a subset of vGlut2-expressing lateral hypothalamus neurons, while most projections to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray arose from a subset of GAD1-expressing zona incerta neurons. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that LH/ZIRXFP3 cells exhibit distinct efferent projection patterns throughout the brain depending on their topographical location within these nuclei, likely reflecting the functional diversity of these neurons.",

      "title": "A Cell-Based Assay to Categorize Variants of Human Succinate Semialdehyde Dehydrogenase Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder",
      "content": "Many genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a result of sequencing the genomes of individuals with ASD, however in most cases it remains unclear which genes are playing causative roles. ALDH5A1, which encodes the enzyme succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), an important regulator of GABA metabolism, is causative in the syndrome SSADH deficiency and is also implicated in ASD. However, it is unknown how variants found in ASD affect SSADH function. We developed a yeast growth assay that models SSADH deficiency to quantify the functional impact of seven ALDH5A1 variants found in ASD. In this assay, expression of human ALDH5A1 partially complemented the growth defect caused by deletion of the ALDH5A1 ortholog UGA2. Using growth rate measurements, we calculated functional scores for 27 variants divided into calibration and ASD test variant groups. Functional scores for benign and pathogenic calibration variants segregated accordingly, validating the assay, while ASD variants displayed a range of activities from complete loss to normal function. Comparisons with published enzymatic assays and computational predictions showed broad agreement, while also identifying some limitations of these approaches.",

      "title": "Microglial epigenetic memory is associated with accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain induced by prophylactic macrophage-derived small extracellular vesicles",
      "content": "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) including exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and can exert immunomodulatory effects in recipient cells. We have shown that a single prophylactic intrathecal injection of sEVs from RAW 264.7 macrophages two weeks prior, promotes faster resolution of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) mouse model of inflammatory pain. How this long-term memory develops, and how sEVs regulate immune responses are unknown. Recent studies have shown that priming microglia with inflammatory stimuli can enhance or suppress responses to a delayed secondary insult via epigenetic modifications. We hypothesized that prophylactic intrathecal administration of macrophage-derived sEVs confers accelerated resolution of inflammatory pain by reprogramming epigenetic memory in spinal microglia in recipient CFA model mice. To determine whether prophylactic sEVs could attenuate pain in the absence of microglia when administering sEVs, we ablated microglia using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622. sEV-induced pain prophylaxis was completely abolished in PLX5622-fed mice, indicating that microglia are required to be present during sEV administration to confer early resolution of inflammatory pain hypersensitivity. ChIP-seq analysis in spinal microglia 14 days after sEV administration (prior to CFA) revealed an increased number of gene loci enriched for H3K4me1, a hallmark of innate immune memory. Furthermore, inhibiting the H3K4 mono-methyltransferase SETD7 abolished sEV-induced pain attenuation. Our findings indicate that both microglia and its epigenetic reprogramming contribute to pain prophylaxis induced by macrophage-derived sEVs, providing novel insights into the development of non-addictive preventive analgesia.",

      "content": "Polyglutamine diseases are incurable genetic neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the accumulation of mutant proteins with extended polyglutamine fragments, which are prone to the formation of poorly soluble aggregates. The establishment of adequate cellular models is crucial in uncovering the pathological mechanisms responsible for neurotoxicity in HD, screening for therapeutic molecules and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms impacted by particular compound. In the present study, genetic constructs based on the Sleeping Beauty system were created for the stable inducible expression of full-length normal and mutant huntingtin in eukaryotic cells. These constructs were then employed to develop model neuronal cells using Neuro-2a cell line. The expression of huntingtin as well as the accumulation of Htt-immunopositive intracellular aggregates (most characteristic features of HD) was demonstrated, and these aggregates mostly colocalized with the proteasome. The activation of the proteasome, as well as changes in the expression of proteasome regulators, components of the autophagy system, and the protease cathepsin D, reflect the versatility of cellular responses to the destructive mutant Htt pathological forms.",

      "title": "Temporal Patterns of Brain Network Plasticity During the Onset and Maintenance of Neuropathic Pain in Male Mice",
      "content": "Neuropathic pain arises from complex peripheral and central mechanisms and induces long-lasting maladaptive changes in the brain. To investigate the temporal dynamics of these changes, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (FC) in a mouse model of neuropathic pain across its initiation and maintenance phases. Using functional ultrasound imaging to capture whole-brain FC over disease progression, we conducted two complementary studies: a longitudinal assessment in anesthetized animals and an analysis of awake cohorts at distinct disease stages. Both exploratory and literature-guided analyses revealed that FC across most large-scale networks remained remarkably stable during pain maintenance. In contrast, pain onset was marked by enhanced FC between key regions involved in sensory, emotional, and motivational processing, including the motor cortex and nucleus accumbens, the prelimbic and insular cortices, and the infralimbic cortex and hypothalamus. As pain persisted, we observed reduced FC within the somatomotor network, reflecting functional disconnection. Additionally, postsurgical pain alone produced enduring FC changes within the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and insula, indicating long-term central plasticity independent of neuropathic injury. Together, these findings reveal dynamic, network-specific adaptations that distinguish the onset and maintenance phases of neuropathic pain and surgery-related plasticity.",
