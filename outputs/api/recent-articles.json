      "title": "The hidden phase of memory: EEG signatures of reactivation during post-retrieval rest",
      "content": "Memory retrieval reactivates previously encoded representations, allowing for their modification and strengthening. However, the neural processes that follow reactivation and contribute to long-term retention remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the post-retrieval resting period to identify neural markers of memory reactivation and their relation to subsequent memory performance. Participants learned pairs of nonsense syllables in multisensory contexts and, on the following day, received either a cue-syllable reminder (context + cue syllable; RX) or a context-only reminder (RCTX) while EEG activity was recorded before and after the reminder presentation. Both reminders elicited significant reductions in beta power (25-40)Hz during the post-reminder rest, consistent with memory reactivation. The magnitude of beta decrement correlated with better long-term performance. Graph-theoretical analyses of phase synchronization networks in the beta band revealed that the RCTX reminder produced higher bilateral frontal betweenness centrality, suggesting greater engagement of frontal regions in mediating global information flow when retrieving only contextual cues. Moreover, frontal centrality and network density were predictive of subsequent memory accuracy. These findings demonstrate that memory reactivation extends beyond cue presentation into post-retrieval rest, leaving identifiable oscillatory and topological signatures that influence memory persistence. Our results underscore the crucial role of frontal network dynamics and beta-band activity in facilitating long-term memory.",

      "title": "Reactivating aversive memories in humans: An EEG and Microstates study of post-retrieval processes",
      "content": "Although fear conditioning is one of the most widely used models to study anxiety in humans, much remains to be explored regarding its underlying neural correlates. It is known that the retrieval of consolidated memories can trigger modifications, weakening, strengthening, or updating of the original memory, depending on the cues presented during the reminder. In this study, we employed a three-day threat-conditioning protocol in which an angry face (conditioned stimulus, CS+) was paired with an aversive sound (unconditioned stimulus, US). Our main objective was to identify neural markers of post-retrieval processes triggered by the presentation of the CS+ alone, 24 hours after acquisition. Additionally, we aimed to assess cognitive biases by examining how the perception of the conditioned stimulus changes following conditioning. To this end, we recorded resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) activity using a 30-channel system at a 256 Hz sampling rate. We analyzed four minutes of resting-state EEG following the presentation of the reminder cue, focusing on memory-related patterns in the frequency domain and microstate dynamics. We compared neural activity after the reminder presentation between two groups: a Reactivation group previously exposed to threat conditioning on the first day and a Control group with no prior conditioning. Our results confirmed successful conditioning (CS+ US association) and memory retention 48 hours later, as evidenced by higher skin conductance responses and greater US expectancy to the CS+. Moreover, participants rated the CS+ face as more aversive than the CS-; face 48 hours after conditioning, compared to their pre-conditioning ratings. Relative to the Control group, the Reactivation group showed decreased beta-band activity (25-30 Hz) in central regions during the 90 seconds following the reminder, which may reflect enhanced post-reactivation processing of the memory, in contrast to participants who saw the face for the first time. Previous research has highlighted the role of reduced beta amplitude in the encoding and retrieval of another type of memory: episodic memory. Furthermore, when analyzing EEG microstates (short-lived, quasi-stable topographies of brain activity that reoccur over time), we found lower global field power for microstates C, A, E, and B in the Reactivation group compared with the Control group. Our findings provide initial evidence for neural correlates associated with post-retrieval processes, including decreased beta activity and microstate level differences related to the post-retrieval processing of an implicit memory.",

      "title": "Neural Encoding through Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation",
      "content": "Hierarchical encoding is a structural element of the Free Energy Principle and related information-centric accounts of brain function, but a concrete circuit-level mechanism for it remains elusive. Here we examine Hierarchical Amplitude Modulation (HAM). In this computationally grounded scheme, information is encoded in the envelope of a carrier and slower brain rhythms multiplicatively modulate the amplitude of faster rhythms, creating a cascade of nested oscillatory envelopes. This multiplicative architecture naturally produces intermodulation frequencies (of the form fc + {sum} ai fi). It predicts that oscillation frequency bands should be log-spaced (r {gtrsim} 2-3, depending on the number of modulation layers) to avoid spectral overlap, as in constant-Q filter banks, consistent with the observed logarithmic spacing of canonical brain rhythms (with ratios ~2-3). HAM's log-uniform distribution yields a 1/f global spectral profile and 1/f sideband spectra in the broadband \"aperiodic\" component, with the slope determined by modulation depth and band ratio. We then demonstrate modulation and demodulation in the laminar neural mass model (LaNMM), where a fast excitatory-inhibitory oscillator circuit couples with a slower cortical oscillator (Janse-Rit). Through the network's intrinsic nonlinearities and cross-frequency coupling, amplitude modulation and demodulation are implemented. These results provide a novel circuit-level mechanism for hierarchical predictive coding, linking theoretical principles to observed spectral features of brain activity.",
