      "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
      "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

      "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

      "title": "Closed-Loop Manual Control With Tactile or Visual Feedback Under Wireless Link Impairments",
      "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

      "title": "Measurement of Airborne Ultrasound Focus on Skin Surface Using Thermal Imaging",
      "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

      "title": "TexSenseGAN: A User-Guided System for Optimizing Texture-Related Vibrotactile Feedback Using Generative Adversarial Network",
      "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

      "content": "Humans operating in dynamic environments with limited visibility are susceptible to collisions with moving objects, occupational hazards, and/or other agents, which can result in personal injuries or fatalities. Most existing research has focused on using vibrotactile cues to address this challenge. In this work, we propose a fundamentally new approach that utilizes variable impedance on an active exoskeleton to guide humans away from hazards and towards safe areas. This framework combines artificial potential fields with current impedance-based theories of exoskeleton control to provide a comprehensive navigational system that is intuitive for human operators. First, we present the mathematical framework to encode information about the locations of obstacles and the safest direction in which to move. Next, we optimize controller parameters in a series of human-subject experiments. Finally, we evaluate the framework in virtual reality on a set of randomly generated obstacle fields in environments where vision is either fully or partially occluded. Our results suggest that the exoskeleton provides significant separation from obstacles and reduced collisions compared to vision alone in conditions where visibility was limited to less than 1.3 m. Our work demonstrates that force-feedback in parallel with a human can improve overall navigation ability in low visibility conditions.",

      "title": "The nuclear receptor NR4A1 serves as a neutrophil-intrinsic regulator mitigating stroke severity",
      "content": "Ischemic stroke is accompanied by recruitment and activation of immune cells which play an important role in the progression of the brain damage. The nuclear receptor NR4A1 emerged as a key regulator within the inflammatory response of several immune diseases by regulating immune cell activation. In this study, we investigated the role of NR4A1 in the activation and recruitment of brain resident and peripheral immune cells after cerebral ischemia. Here, we show that NR4A1 mediates an anti-inflammatory and damage-limiting effect after stroke. This effect is largely mediated by neutrophil recruitment and importantly, NR4A1 activation with its ligand Cytosporone B improves functional outcome and reduces brain damage. Modulation of NR4A1 is therefore a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of the nuclear receptor NR4A1 in the activation and recruitment of peripheral and brain resident immune cells after cerebral ischemia and its consequences for stroke outcome. We demonstrate that NR4A1 ablation augments neutrophil activation and CNS recruitment within days after stroke thereby increasing infarct size, CNS inflammation, neuronal damage and deteriorating functional outcome. This effect is mediated via modulation of cell-intrinsic neutrophil function and maturation as illustrated by neutrophil-specific NR4A1 ablation and mixed bone-marrow chimera experiments. Notably, the NR4A1 agonist Cytosporone B reduced CNS neutrophil infiltration, infarct size and functional outcome after stroke in a bicentric preclinical stroke trial, demonstrating that NR4A1-mediated control of neutrophil reactivity is amenable to pharmacological modulation. In humans, NR4A1 expressing neutrophils are present in the peripheral blood of stroke patients and neutrophil NR4A1 expression correlates with improved long-term outcome after 3 months. Furthermore, NR4A1 expression in brain parenchyma neutrophils is negatively correlated with neuronal cell loss, illustrating a role of NR4A1 in regulating neutrophil mediated neuronal cell death in human stroke. Together our data reveal the nuclear factor NR4A1 as a brake of intrinsic neutrophil activity controlling neutrophil-mediated brain inflammation and neurotoxicity in stroke which may serve as a novel therapeutic target to limit inflammation-associated augmentation of ischemic damage after stroke.",

      "title": "Noradrenergic inputs to the basolateral amygdala have bidirectional effects on coping behavior and neuronal activity in mice",
      "content": "Norepinephrine (NE) signaling is disrupted in stress disorders, with insufficient NE signaling implicated in major depressive disorder and hyperactive NE signaling associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, suggesting that adequate mood regulation requires optimal NE levels. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a hub for stress processing and receives dense noradrenergic innervation from the locus coeruleus (LC), the primary noradrenergic nucleus in the brain. The relationship between LC activity and cognitive/behavioral function during fear conditioning has been described as an inverted U, in which moderate LC activity, and subsequent NE release, is required for adaptive coping to threats, while hyperactive LC-NE signaling drives maladaptive behavioral responses. We used fiber photometry to measure NE signaling in the mouse BLA during acute behavioral responses to escapable and inescapable stressors, and then used an optogenetic approach to stimulate the noradrenergic terminals in the BLA at different frequencies to evaluate effects on coping behavior and cFos expression in the LC-BLA circuit. We found that low-frequency stimulation of the circuit inhibited both passive coping and BLA neuronal activity, while high-frequency stimulation had the opposite effect; the behavioral effects were not mediated by sex, but the cFos effects were specific to males. This study represents an expansion of the inverted U framework to encompass LC-BLA signaling driving acute behavioral responses to stress.",

      "title": "Characterization of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the novel AppSAA Knock-in Alzheimer's disease mouse model",
      "content": "Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) declines with age and is thought to be severely exacerbated in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite numerous efforts to understand how AHN is altered in AD mouse models, results have been inconsistent, largely due to limitations of first-generation transgenic AD mouse models. The newly developed App Knock-in models address many of these limitations. Here, we provide the first in-depth characterization of hippocampal cell populations and AHN across different ages in the novel AppSAAKnock-in (AppKI) mouse model. Our findings reveal that AppKI mice show no early deficits in excitatory dentate granule cells or inhibitory interneurons at 2 and 4 months, but significant loss of both populations emerges by 6 months of age. We also identified a progressive decline in AHN with the survival of newborn neurons being impaired first at 4 months, followed by a deficit in proliferation at 6 months. Furthermore, we demonstrate that exposure to enriched environment, a form of hippocampus-engaged exploration, robustly enhances AHN in AppKI mice, primarily by promoting survival. In conclusion, our study provides a foundational characterization of the AppKI model, establishing a timeline for cellular and AHN deficits.",

      "title": "Ineffective behavioral rescue despite partial brain Dp427 restoration by AAV9-U7-mediated exon 51 skipping in mdx52 mice",
      "content": "The mdx52 mouse model exhibits a common mutation profile associated with brain involvement in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), characterized by heightened anxiety, fearfulness, and impaired associative fear learning. Deletion of exon 52 disrupts the expression of two dystrophins found in the brain (Dp427 and Dp140), and is eligible for therapeutic exon-skipping strategies. We previously demonstrated that a single intracerebroventricular administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting exon 51 of the Dmd gene could restore 5% to 15% of Dp427 expression. This treatment reduced anxiety and unconditioned fear in mdx52 mice, improved fear conditioning acquisition, and partially improved fear memory tested 24 hours later. To improve the restoration of Dp427 and induce a long-lasting therapeutic effect, we employed a vectorized approach using an AAV-U7snRNA vector to deliver antisense sequences to the brains of mdx52 mice. We evaluated two AAV serotypes known for their brain transduction efficiency (AAV9 and RH10) and two delivery routes, intracisterna magna and intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections, to maximize brain targeting. Based on GFP expression data, we selected the AAV9 capsid and a bilateral ICV delivery route. Using this approach, we demonstrated that ICV administration of AAV9-U7-Ex51M induced exon 51 skipping and restored Dp427 expression in the brains of adult mdx52 mice, though with significant variability among individuals. While a few mice showed high Dp427 expression levels, the average restoration was limited to approximately 6% to 12%. In conclusion, inducing exon skipping in the brains of adult mdx52 mice using the vectorized AAV9-U7 approach was less effective than synthetic ASO treatment and did not improve the emotional behavior of mdx52 mice.",

      "title": "A multi-omic atlas of human autonomic and sensory ganglia implicates cell types in peripheral neuropathies",
      "content": "The human peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of many ganglia, including sympathetic ganglia (SG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), that house the cell bodies of many constituent neuron types and non-neuronal cells of the PNS. However, the molecular and cellular diversity of these human PNS cell types and their implications in human diseases remain elusive. By generating an integrated single-cell multi-omic atlas of human SG and DRG, we provide comprehensive transcriptional and epigenomic landscapes of various cell types in these peripheral ganglia. While the major cell types and their transcriptional and epigenomic features are similar between human SG and DRG, we identify key transcriptional and epigenomic differences between SG and DRG cell types, highlighting the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying their specific functions. Moreover, by mapping the expression and chromatin accessibility of disease-associated genes in human SG and DRG cell types, we identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that may underlie various peripheral neuropathies. This atlas serves as a valuable resource for understanding the intricate cell-type-specific molecules and interactions in the human PNS and their implications in human health and diseases.",

      "title": "Temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of cerebral cortical-depth profiles of the BOLD-fMRI response",
      "content": "Functional MRI measures brain activity by tracking the associated hemodynamic response, which is shaped by the vascular anatomy. Microscopy studies have shown that the hemodynamic response initiates within the cerebral cortex then spreads upwards to the pial surface, where the largest fMRI signal changes are seen, however responses at the cortical surface exhibit poor neuronal specificity. Motived by this, we characterized the time-evolution of the fMRI response in humans. At some cortical locations the fMRI response peaked at the pial surface but in others it peaked within the cortex, likely due to the sparsity of large pial vessels and the dense capillary bed in middle cortical layers. We observed the earliest response onset in middle cortical depths, which is also the site of thalamocortical input. Standard approaches that aggregate fMRI responses over space and time may therefore lose meaningful information, and \"physiologically-informed\" strategies may enhance neuronal specificity of fMRI measurements.",
