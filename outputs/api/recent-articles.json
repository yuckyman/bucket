      "title": "Functional Inertia Index of Memory-Retaining Brain Dynamics: A Measure of Large-Scale Brain Adaptability",
      "content": "Adaptive cognition relies on brain activity that is both flexible and resilient to noise, a property we term functional inertia. Conventional dynamic fMRI metrics treat networks as memoryless and cannot capture the persistence that makes some states fleeting and others entrenched. We introduce the functional inertia index (FII), the first index to quantify temporal momentum by measuring the force required to deviate from a brain's long-running trajectory. Applied to resting-state fMRI from a multisite schizophrenia cohort, FII revealed distinct recurrent states, with prolonged residence in a high-inertia plateau predicting greater symptom severity. This effect was mediated by whole-brain FII, which also showed a positive relationship with cognition in patients but a negative relationship in controls, revealing a dissociation between adaptive and maladaptive rigidity. At the regional level, FII unifies two long-standing observations in schizophrenia: excessive rigidity in associative hubs and pathological volatility in sensory pathways, situating both within a single inertial framework and offering a candidate dynamic biomarker.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "NIRS-BIDS: Brain Imaging Data Structure Extended to Near-Infrared Spectroscopy",
      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",
