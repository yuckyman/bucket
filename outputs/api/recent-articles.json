      "title": "Microbiota-Based Interventions Differentially Rescue Gut and Social Behavior Phenotypes in a Drosophila Autism-like Model",
      "content": "Introduction: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurological and developmental disorder that has no cure and is often accompanied by gastrointestinal (GI) issues. The bidirectional communication system known as the gut microbiota-brain axis may help explain how GI dysfunction contributes to neurological symptoms. Loss-of-function mutations in the histone demethylases KDM5A, KDM5B or KDM5C are found in patients with intellectual disability and ASD. Previous studies using a Drosophila Kdm5 loss-of-function (Kdm5LOF) ASD-like model revealed gut microbial dysbiosis, reduced abundance of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and impaired social behavior. While L. plantarum supplementation rescued intestinal abnormalities, it did not restore social behavior. Methods: Here, we evaluated multiple microbiota-based interventions, including probiotic supplementation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, their combination, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), to determine their capacity to modulate gut microbial composition and behavior in Kdm5LOF flies. Gut bacterial abundance was quantified using colony-forming unit (CFU) assays and full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Social behavior was assessed using the social distance assay, while anxiety-like behavior and locomotion were evaluated using the open field test. Gut-specific Kdm5 knockdown was used to assess tissue-specific contributions to microbiota and behavioral phenotypes. Results: Kdm5 deficiency resulted in reduced abundance of culturable Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, and Enterobacter species, accompanied by impaired social behavior. L. plantarum supplementation restored gut microbial abundance in both whole-body Kdm5LOF and gut-specific Kdm5 knockdown models but did not significantly rescue social behavior. In contrast, L. helveticus significantly improved social interaction in Kdm5LOF flies despite minimal effects on gut bacterial abundance, revealing a dissociation between microbial restoration and behavioral outcomes. Gut-specific Kdm5 knockdown phenocopied both microbial and social defects observed in Kdm5LOF mutants. Notably, FMT from healthy donors partially restored Lactobacillus abundance, reshaped gut microbial community structure, and partially improved social behavior in Kdm5LOF recipient flies. Conclusions: Together, these findings identify Kdm5 as a key regulator of gut microbial viability and social behavior and demonstrate that microbiota-based interventions exert strain- and phenotype-specific effects. Our results reveal that restoration of microbial abundance alone is insufficient to rescue social behavior and highlight the importance of functional host-microbe interactions in gut-brain communication. This work establishes Drosophila as a tractable platform for dissecting epigenetic regulation of microbiota-behavior relationships relevant to ASD and for evaluating targeted probiotic and microbiota-transfer strategies.",

      "title": "Slow breathing impacts inter-organ dynamics modulating brain function and risk behavior",
      "content": "Successful decision-making requires that external information be interpreted in the context of the state of the body. Within the framework of body-brain interaction, deliberately modifying autonomic state can shape how we evaluate the world, ultimately influencing choices. Yet, it remains unclear whether and how intentional autonomic regulation affects human decision-making. In this study, we tested instructed prolonged exhalation, a slow-breathing technique designed to boost parasympathetic activity during risky decision-making. Participants followed distinct breathing protocols while making risky choices, with neural and physiological activity measured using fMRI and multi-channel monitoring. Prolonged exhalation increased risky choices by enhancing reward sensitivity and elevating cardiac parasympathetic activity. Importantly, individuals with greater parasympathetic upregulation also showed stronger reward-related responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and precuneus. Our work reveals a transformative role for breathing-based interventions, demonstrating that breathing-based autonomic regulation can shape value-based decision-making through neuro-cardiac pathways.",

      "title": "Cross-individual translation of spontaneous zebrafish brain activity through a shared latent representation",
      "content": "Spontaneous activity is a hallmark of brain function, reflecting the underlying circuit organization. Identifying conserved structure across individuals in this self-sustained activity has remained a longstanding challenge, especially in vertebrates where one-to-one neuron correspondence is inaccessible. Here, we introduce latent-aligned Restricted Boltzmann Machines (LaRBMs), an unsupervised generative approach that uncovers a common representational space from cell-resolved whole-brain recordings in larval zebrafish. This latent space consists of spatially localized co-activation motifs, or cell assemblies, that generalize across animals and form interpretable building blocks of population-wide activity. LaRBMs enable bidirectional mapping of brain states between individuals: activity patterns from one fish can be encoded into the latent space and decoded into another. The translated patterns are assigned high probability by the recipient model and retain the original spatial organization. These results show that spontaneous activity in the vertebrate brain is highly stereotyped at the level of functional cell assemblies and can be reliably captured through a common latent code. Because it provides an interpretable and quantitative framework for functional cross-individual alignment, LaRBM paves the way for comparative phenotyping of brain activity across developmental, genetic, and pathological variation.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",
