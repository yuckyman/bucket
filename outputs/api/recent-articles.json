      "title": "The BrainHealth Project study protocol: a scalable digital approach to measuring and promoting multidimensional brain health across the lifespan",
      "content": "BackgroundOptimization of brain health is a focal point in medical science, yet data regarding measuring, improving, and preserving lifelong brain health are lacking. This void demands an objective, change-sensitive measure of brain health and proven strategies to strengthen brain performance. The BrainHealth Project addresses these key issues, drawing upon neuroplasticity evidence of persistent modifiability of brain function across the lifespan. This landmark study aims to (i) evaluate and refine multidimensional change indices of brain health, (ii) evaluate the impact of evidenced-based cognitive strategies and lifestyle interventions on improving/maintaining brain health, and (iii) elucidate the mechanisms associated with brain health gains/losses.MethodsThis quantitative, longitudinal, interventional, open-label, single-arm clinical trial aims to recruit 100,000 generally healthy adults ages 18\u2013100 and evaluate changes for 10 years or longer. Assessments, coaching, and training are conducted online through the secure BrainHealth Platform, allowing utilization tracking. The BrainHealth Index (BHI) \u2013 a multidimensional assessment \u2013 is offered at baseline and every 6 months. Participants have access to coaching every 3 months and continual access to self-paced trainings and resources. The primary outcome is the composite BrainHealth Index score and its empirically derived subdomain scores: Clarity (cognitive health), Connectedness (social health), and Emotional Balance (mental health). The BHI includes validated measures sensitive to change, including gains or losses associated with behavior change and integration of cognitive strategies into daily life. This Index contrasts with traditional assessments focused primarily on detecting cognitive decline or diagnosing pathological conditions, yet it, too, has been found to be sensitive to small incremental losses. The primary online training, SMART (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Tactics), is a strategy-based program validated with 25+ years of research. SMART promotes improvements in neural health, cognition, wellbeing, connectedness, and real-life function, previously reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Statistical approaches focus on individual prediction using nonlinear models trained with large samples and on assessing mechanisms influencing gains or losses on brain health metrics.DiscussionThis research extends prior RCT evidence to a longitudinal, epidemiologic approach, leveraging digital health and machine learning tools to deliver a generalizable measure of longitudinal brain health and actionable ways to achieve precision brain health. By integrating advanced statistical methods and large-scale data, the BrainHealth Project aims to provide medicine and society with accurate, multidimensional, sensitive, and actionable ways to optimize brain health practices across the lifespan.",

      "title": "I built botoease: A unified wrapper to switch between Local Storage and AWS S3 without changing code",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> <code>botoease</code> is a lightweight Python library designed to solve the &quot;environment gap&quot; between development and production. It provides a unified API that handles file uploads, deletions, and URL generation.</p> <p>In development, it saves files to a local folder on your machine. In production, it automatically switches to AWS S3 using the exact same method calls. It removes the need to write verbose <code>boto3</code> boilerplate or complex <code>if/else</code> logic to check which environment your code is running in.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> This library is intended for backend developers (FastAPI, Flask, Django) who are building MVPs or small-to-medium applications. It is currently in the &quot;Beta/Production-Ready for small apps&quot; stage (v0.0.6). It is ideal for developers who want to avoid vendor lock-in or who need to onboard new team members without giving them AWS credentials immediately.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>boto3</code><strong>:</strong> <code>boto3</code> is the standard SDK but is very low-level and verbose. To upload a file and get a URL, you often need 10+ lines of code involving sessions, clients, and exception handling. <code>botoease</code> wraps this into a single line: <code>storage.upload()</code>.</li> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>django-storages</code><strong>:</strong> <code>django-storages</code> is excellent but is tightly coupled to the Django framework. <code>botoease</code> is framework-agnostic and works equally well in FastAPI, Flask, or simple CLI scripts.</li> <li><strong>vs.</strong> <code>smart_open</code><strong>:</strong> <code>smart_open</code> is great for streaming large files but doesn't focus as much on the &quot;developer experience&quot; of generating pre-signed URLs or managing local development folders automatically.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Unified API:</strong> <code>storage.upload()</code> works for both S3 and Local disk.</li> <li><strong>Auto-Directory Management:</strong> Automatically creates local folders if they don't exist.</li> <li><strong>S3 Pre-signed URLs:</strong> Generates secure access links with one command.</li> <li><strong>Zero Boilerplate:</strong> No need to manually configure <code>boto3.client</code>.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Example Usage</strong></p> <p>Python</p> <pre><code>from botoease import Storage # 1. Initialize (Switch backend here easily) # For Local: backend=&quot;local&quot; # For S3: backend=&quot;s3&quot;, bucket=&quot;my-bucket&quot; storage = Storage(backend=&quot;local&quot;, folder=&quot;uploads&quot;) # 2. Upload (Code stays the same regardless of backend) file_data = storage.upload(&quot;report.pdf&quot;) print(f&quot;File saved at: {file_data['path']}&quot;) </code></pre> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Source Code (GitHub):</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Bhuvangs04/botoease\">Click to Github</a></li> <li><strong>PyPI:</strong><a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/botoease/\">Click to open PyPI</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Desk2666\"> /u/Longjumping-Desk2666 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ph7vzw/i_built_botoease_a_unified_wrapper_to_switch/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1ph7vzw/i_built_botoease_a_unified_wrapper_to_switch/\">[comments]</a></span>",
