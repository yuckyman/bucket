      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

To address such limitations, including various artifact types, insufficient annotations, and low spatial resolutions, we present PhysioMotion Artifact, a large-scale, task-driven EEG dataset with channellevel artifact annotations. EEG data was acquired from 30 healthy participants performing 16 systematically designed single-type and multi-type movement tasks, inducing 14 distinct types of physiological artifacts.

      "content": "Parkinsons Disease (PD) is characterised by accumulation of -synuclein (-Syn), but how elevated -Syn alters presynaptic architecture during prodromal phases of the disease remains unclear. We investigated presynaptic morphology and two key presynaptic proteins: MYCBP2; and the Active Zone (AZ) protein ELKS. Primary rat cortical neurons were transfected with wildtype -Syn, or the familial A30P mutant, and nanoscopic changes to bouton morphology and protein localisation were investigated using super-resolution microscopy. Variant specific accumulation patterns for overexpressed -Syn were observed without changes to bouton structure. Additionally, increases of both -Syn variants affected presynaptic proteins, decreasing MYCBP2 puncta count and intensity, and reducing ELKS protein density. Since MYCBP2 potentially regulates ELKS, these findings suggest that elevated -Syn perturbs AZ components whilst presynaptic structure is preserved. Our study supports growing evidence that increased -Syn disturbs presynaptic function potentially through a MYCBP2-ELKS axis, a mechanism which may provide a valuable target for PD therapeutics.",

      "content": "ObjectivePost-stroke depression (PSD), a common neuropsychiatric complication, significantly hinders stroke recovery and quality of life. Given the established role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PSD, this study aimed to identify key inflammation-related genes and pathways using bioinformatics and machine learning and further evaluate the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomer compounds.MethodsPSD-related datasets (GSE16561, GSE98793) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, followed by functional enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Three machine learning algorithms\u2014random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)\u2014were applied to screen inflammation-related hub genes. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Candidate TCM compounds were explored via the Coremine Medical database. A PSD rat model was established to validate hub gene expression and to assess the efficacy of berberine (BBR).ResultsAnalysis identified 35 inflammation-related DEGs (IDEGs) significantly enriched in immunological processes, including malaria pathogenesis, NETosis, innate immune deficiencies, Rap1 signaling, and IL-17 cascades. The integration of machine learning pinpointed TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core hub genes, demonstrating robust diagnostic performance in external validation. Molecular docking suggested a strong binding affinity between the TCM compound BBR and TLR2/CYP1B1 proteins. PSD rats exhibited prolonged immobility in forced swim/tail suspension tests and decreased sucrose preference versus controls, alongside neuronal damage, edema, and inflammatory infiltration (HE staining). BBR treatment reversed these behavioral deficits and pathological changes. Western blot analysis confirmed elevated TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression in PSD rats, significantly downregulated by BBR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed increased serum IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels in PSD, which BBR effectively reduced.ConclusionThis study identifies TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core inflammation-related genes in PSD. BBR demonstrates therapeutic efficacy as an active monomer compound against PSD, likely mediated through downregulating TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression, consequently diminishing the concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) that mediate cerebroprotective actions.",

      "title": "Prognostic value of quantitative and visual electroencephalography in disorders of consciousness: a retrospective study",
      "content": "BackgroundElectroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to assess prognosis in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Visual assessments by physicians and quantitative EEG (qEEG) are commonly used; however, only a few studies have directly compared their predictive accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the prognostic value of visual EEG classification versus that of qEEG-based spectral analysis for survival and neurological outcomes in patients with impaired consciousness.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we examined 97 patients with impaired consciousness admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Fukushima Medical University Hospital between April 2018 and December 2023. Visual EEG grading was performed using a conventional grading system based on established criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare predictive performance. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed incorporating qEEG and clinical prognostic factors (Scarpino score, rehabilitation status, and age). The incremental predictive value of clinical variables was assessed using DeLong\u2019s test.ResultsVisual EEG assessment showed moderate predictive accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77 for survival; 0.677\u20130.725 for neurological outcomes]. qEEG-based models showed comparable performance to visual EEG classification, with slightly higher AUC values that were not statistically significant. The addition of clinical factors significantly improved predictive accuracy, particularly for neurological recovery (AUC improved from 0.729 to 0.936; P < 0.001).ConclusionCombining qEEG features and clinical prognostic factors provided a comprehensive approach for outcome prediction in patients with DoC. These findings support the potential of a multimodal prognostic framework integrating objective EEG metrics and physician-derived evaluations, although further prospective validation is required.",

      "content": "ObjectivesMutations in KIDINS220 are known to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and SINO syndrome. However, the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of KIDINS220-related disorders remains incompletely understood. Herein, we describe the clinical, electrophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features of a novel KIDINS220 sterile alpha motif (SAM) -like domain mutation identified in a Chinese family with HSP accompanied by severe peripheral neuropathy (PN).MethodsClinical data, electrophysiological characteristics, and sural nerve histopathology were analyzed in a 19-year-old Chinese male. Genetic testing was performed in his family by using whole-exome sequencing, mitochondrial genome testing, and Sanger validation. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze the phenotypic and genetic data of previously reported cases with KIDINS220 variants up to July 2025.ResultsThe proband exhibited classical signs of autosomal dominant HSP accompanied by severe multifocal sensory-motor PN. The spinal cord MRI showed mild spinal cord thinning, while the brain MRI and nerve ultrasound examinations were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed absent sensory nerve responses and globally reduced motor conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed significantly reduced nerve fiber density, myelin defects, axonal degeneration, and mitochondrial abnormalities. A heterozygous KIDINS220 c.3668A > G (p. Glu1223Gly) mutation, located within the SAM domain, was identified in both the proband and his mother. A total of 42 cases from 11 cohorts were reviewed.ConclusionWe suggest that patients with KIDINS220 SAM domain mutation may present with HSP accompanied by severe, mixed axonal and demyelinating PN, expanding the existing spectrum of the clinical phenotypes and pathogenic variants of KIDINS220.",

      "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease is related to imbalanced stopping-related cortical activity",
      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
