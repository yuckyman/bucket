      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Investigating singing imagery as an additional or alternative control task for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces",
      "content": "IntroductionBrain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a movement-free means of communication and control, typically based on motor imagery (MI) tasks of hand, foot, or tongue movements. Most BCI studies focus on classifying up to four such tasks, which limits the number of available commands and restricts overall system functionality. Expanding the range of reliable mental tasks would directly increase the number of possible commands and thereby enhance the practical utility of BCIs. Singing imagery (SI) may offer an intuitive alternative or additional task to complement conventional MI paradigms.MethodsEEG data were recorded from 14 participants performing right-hand, left-hand, foot, and tongue MI, SI, and rest. Features were extracted using filter bank common spatial patterns (FBCSP), and tasks were classified with a random forest algorithm across 2-, 4-, 5-, and 6-class scenarios. Subjective data regarding participants' perceived task difficulty and general task preferences was also collected.ResultsClassification accuracies with SI included were comparable to subsets of conventional MI tasks in 2-, 4-, and 5-class scenarios. In the 6-class scenario, average accuracy was approximately 60%, with six participants exceeding 70%, the level often cited as being necessary for effective BCI control. It is reasonable to expect performance to improve further with more advanced analysis methods and participant training.ConclusionThese promising results suggest that singing imagery can serve as both an additional and an alternative task in MI-BCIs. In lower-class systems, SI may provide a valuable option for generating commands, particularly for users who may find some conventional MI tasks less intuitive. When combined with the established MI tasks, SI could increase the number of possible commands, thereby extending the functional capacity of BCI systems. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of SI to broaden the repertoire of mental tasks available for BCI control and to advance the development of more flexible, powerful, and user-centered BCI applications.",

      "title": "Investigating the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus in language evolution: insights from comparative neuroscience",
      "content": "The evolutionary adaptation of the left inferior frontal gyrus is considered a crucial neural specialization supporting the emergence of human language. As a central node in the language network, it is linked to the temporoparietal cortex via both the ventral and dorsal pathways. These connections enable humans to combine a limited set of vocal elements into infinitely diverse, hierarchically structured sequences. Although homologous brain structures are also present in non-human primates, language remains a uniquely human faculty. This review synthesizes anatomical, functional, and connectivity evidence across species to trace the evolution of the left inferior frontal gyrus in support of language. We argue that language did not emerge from novel cortical areas, but through the gradual repurposing, expansion, and optimization of pre-existing fronto-temporal circuits. Human-specific innovations include vocal neuron specialization, volumetric expansion, strengthened connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus, and a functional shift within the left inferior frontal gyrus from motor control to syntactic processing. Finally, we discuss how lesion studies contribute to our understanding of the brain\u2019s potential for language acquisition and its neurobiological constraints.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "Dynamic mode decomposition of resting-state fMRI revealing abnormal brain region features in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Autonomic small fiber involvement in painful long COVID: a histological and clinical study",
      "content": "BackgroundDespite growing recognition of painful long COVID syndrome as a chronic neurological condition marked by pain and autonomic symptoms, the precise contribution of autonomic small fiber involvement is still not well characterized and understood. In this retrospective study, we aimed to identify autonomic small fiber involvement in patients with painful long COVID syndrome by analyzing skin biopsy data. We used nerve fiber density in the piloerector muscles (PMNFD) and sweat glands (SGNFD) as the primary histological outcomes of autonomic innervation.MethodsWe reviewed skin biopsy samples from 50 patients with painful long COVID syndrome and included 31 patients with available PMNFD and SGNFD data for analysis. PMNFD and SGNFD were compared with an age- and sex-matched healthy control group (n = 42). To evaluate whether autonomic involvement was independent of somatic nerve fiber reduction, a subgroup analysis was performed in patients with normal intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) (n = 23). Correlations between histological findings and autonomic symptoms, assessed with the COMPASS-31 questionnaire, were also analyzed.ResultsPiloerector muscle nerve fiber density and SGNFD were significantly reduced in patients with long COVID compared with controls, both in the full sample (p = 0.0135; p < 0.0001) and in the subgroup with normal IENFD (p = 0.0003; p = 0.0005). Neither PMNFD nor SGNFD correlated with COMPASS-31 scores (p = 0.27; p = 0.46) and no association with disease onset, duration and COVID-19 severity was found.ConclusionThese findings provide histological evidence that autonomic small fiber damage is a prominent and measurable feature of painful long COVID syndrome. Importantly, this pathology was also observed in patients with preserved IENFD, indicating that autonomic involvement may occur independently of somatic small fiber loss.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.
