      "content": "Attentional states are highly dynamic and variable, fluctuating from moment to moment and showing stark differences across contexts. To what extent does functional brain reorganization capture variability in attentional states? In the present study we utilize a time-resolved measure of functional MRI connectivity to examine and compare the extent to which univariate activity and functional networks reflect second-to-second sustained attentional fluctuations. Sustained attention was measured objectively, using auditory and visual tasks, and subjectively while participants watched and listened to narratives. Results revealed that objective measures of sustained attention to images and sounds involved common patterns of neural activity and functional interactions. Additionally, networks related to sustained attentional performance during controlled tasks also predicted fluctuations in subjective attentional engagement while participants watched movies and listened to a podcast. Generalization between experimental and everyday task contexts highlights the robustness of time-resolved functional networks for capturing dynamic fluctuations in sustained attentional states.",

      "title": "A groove brain-music interface for enhancing individual experience of urge to move",
      "content": "When we listen to music, we often feel a pleasurable urge to move to music, known as groove. While previous studies have identified musical features that contribute to the groove experience, such as syncopation and tempo, they also report individual differences in which kinds of music people experience groove. Therefore, recommending groove-eliciting music requires accounting for individual differences. In this study, we aimed to develop a groove brain-music interface (G-BMI) that generates personalized playlists to maximize each individual's groove experience, using a neurofeedback system based on in-ear EEG. Twenty-four participants listened to three high-groove and three low-groove musical excerpts and rated their \"urge to move.\" Using these ratings and the recorded EEG, we trained two LASSO models to build the G-BMI. Model 1 predicted urge to move from acoustic features extracted with VGGish, a pretrained neural network. Model 2 classified EEG data as recorded during listening to high-groove or low-groove music. Using Model 1, we ranked 7,225 candidate songs by predicted groove and assembled one groove-augmenting and one groove-diminishing playlist. Using Models 1 and 2, we created two additional playlists that updated Model 1 and the ranking in real-time based on in-ear EEG. Participants then listened to all four playlists and rated them on items including \"urge to move.\" The groove-augmenting playlist that incorporated EEG achieved the highest \"urge to move\" ratings. These findings suggest that a personalized neurofeedback system employing EEG can help maximize individual groove experience.",

      "title": "Methylphenidate-induced reductions in choice impulsivity are associated with alterations in cortico-striatal beta oscillations.",
      "content": "Impulsive choice- preferring small, immediate rewards over larger, delayed reward- is a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. Methylphenidate, a dopamine and noradrenaline transporter inhibitor, reduces impulsivity, but the neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Identifying a neurophysiological signature of methylphenidate action could be used clinically to predict treatment response and guide drug development. To this end, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) from 32 electrodes spanning cortico-striatal circuits in rats performing a temporal discounting task, under saline or methylphenidate treatment conditions. Methylphenidate decreased beta frequency (15-30 Hz) power and connectivity for small, immediate rewards while simultaneously increasing beta power for large, delayed rewards. Reduced connectivity in cortico-striatal networks during small rewards predicted increased preference for delayed rewards. These findings suggest that methylphenidate influences discounting behavior by modulating reward-evoked beta oscillations in cortico-striatal networks. Thus, beta oscillations may serve as a translational biomarker of treatment responsivity to monoaminergic drugs, providing a circuit-level assay to measure and predict changes in impulsive behavior.",

      "title": "A hardwired neural circuit for temporal difference learning",
      "content": "The neurotransmitter dopamine plays a major role in learning by acting as a teaching signal to update the brain's predictions about rewards. A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.",

      "title": "Morphological heterogeneity of human astrocytes in cerebral organoids",
      "content": "Astrocytes are a type of glial cell in the central nervous system responsible for modulating synaptic transmissions, tissue repair, maintaining homeostasis, and are therefore implicated in many neurological diseases. Human cortical astrocytes are more structurally complex, larger, and have unique subtypes in comparison to the commonly studied rodent cortical astrocytes. As access to human cortical tissue is sparse, cerebral organoids (COs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a promising in vitro model for studying the human cortex. Astrocyte subtypes unique to humans are recapitulated in COs but have not been quantitatively assessed (1, 2). In this study, we characterized human astrocytes in situ in sliced COs cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI-COs). By 4 months of age, ALI-COs express many mature astrocyte markers and showed increasing levels of GFAP with longer culture durations. By employing immunostaining, tissue clearing, morphological reconstruction, and unsupervised clustering analysis, three major GFAP+ astrocyte subtypes were identified in ALI-COs. All subtypes exhibited greater morphological complexity than their mouse counterparts, as revealed by increased branching and longer branch extensions. However, consistent with the mid-gestation fetal stage of the ALI-COs, astrocytes did not fully recapitulate the complexity observed in adult human astrocytes, which are known to continue maturation postnatally.",

      "title": "Brain structure correlates of foreign language learning experiences",
      "content": "Previous research demonstrates that bilingual experiences produce dynamic and variable structural adaptations in the brain. However, most studies focus on individuals who naturally acquire multiple languages, leaving the neural effects of long-term foreign language learners with limited exposure less understood. In this study, we examined 32 young adult long-term foreign language learners in South Korea to determine how age of acquisition, proficiency, and daily use shape gray matter volume and white matter integrity in predominantly monolingual environments. We found structural changes in brain regions involved in language control and executive function. Voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that earlier foreign language acquisition was significantly associated with greater gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal lobule (uncorrected p < 0.001) and the left thalamus (uncorrected p < 0.001). Higher daily use was significantly associated with greater volume in the right inferior parietal lobule (uncorrected p = 0.001) but reduced it in the right anterior cingulate cortex (uncorrected p < 0.001). Tract-based spatial statistics analysis further showed that earlier age of acquisition was significantly associated with better white matter integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum (FWE-corrected p = 0.009), while higher daily use was significantly associated with better integrity in the body of the corpus callosum (FWE-corrected p = 0.030). These findings suggest that even limited but sustained exposure to a foreign language can lead to significant structural adaptations, broadening our understanding of language-related neuroplasticity beyond traditional bilingual contexts.",
