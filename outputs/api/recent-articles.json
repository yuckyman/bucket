      "title": "Severity-dependent proteomic alterations in the rat hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus",
      "content": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged seizure state that can induce lasting hippocampal damage and promote the development of spontaneous seizures and cognitive deficits. The severity and duration of SE strongly influence these long-term outcomes; however, many experimental studies rely on behavioral assessments such as the Racine scale, which may not capture subclinical or non-convulsive seizure activity. Consequently, the molecular consequences of lower-severity seizures that do not meet conventional criteria for severe SE, but may nonetheless contribute to epileptogenesis, remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated whether behavioral seizure severity in the pilocarpine model correlates with distinct proteomic alterations in the hippocampus. Seizures were induced in adult male rats using pilocarpine, and animals were behaviorally classified into three groups: control, mild SE, and severe SE. Hippocampal tissue was collected from control (n = 3), mild SE (n = 5), and severe SE (n = 6) rats and subjected to mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Proteomic profiles were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using volcano plots. Functional enrichment analyses were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases. Our findings revealed distinct hippocampal proteomic signatures across control, mild SE, and severe SE groups, as revealed by PLS-DA. Severe SE was associated with widespread proteomic alterations, including 129 DEPs linked to synaptic structure, RNA regulation, and metabolic processes. In contrast, mild SE was associated with fewer changes (81 DEPs), primarily involving synaptic organization and endocytosis. A direct comparison of the severe and mild SE groups identified 76 DEPs enriched in pathways related to synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Notably, 23 proteins showed a stepwise expression pattern across groups, suggesting a molecular gradient correlated with seizure severity. Correlation analyses identified and further confirmed glial and inflammatory molecules as candidate molecular markers associated with seizure burden. In conclusion, behavioral seizure severity in the pilocarpine model corresponds to distinct hippocampal proteomic profiles, with severe SE inducing broader and more pronounced molecular alterations than mild SE. Importantly, lower-severity SE is associated with biologically meaningful changes in pathways related to synaptic organization and cellular processing, highlighting mechanistic differences between mild and severe SE that may contribute to epileptogenic progression.",

      "title": "Preparation and application of YFV-17D-derived Anterograde Trans-neuronal Viral Vectors for Neuroscience Research",
      "content": "Trans-neuronal viruses that spread between synaptically connected neurons have become invaluable tools in neuroscience, enabling circuit mapping and targeted delivery of genetic material to cells within defined pathways. Although most available trans-neuronal viral tracers propagate retrogradely, an anterograde trans-neuronal virus that spread from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons would substantially expand experimental capabilities. We previously demonstrated that YFV-17D--a live attenuated yellow fever vaccine used clinically for decades--spreads anterogradely along neuronal circuits. We further developed a suite of recombinant YFV-17D-based vectors for diverse applications, including tracing monosynaptic projectome of defined neuronal cell types, multiplex mapping of parallel pathways, and trans-neuronal genetic manipulation with minimal neurotoxicity. We have now tested and optimized procedures for vector production and application. Based on these optimizations, here, we present a two part guide for preparing and deploying this viral vector system to map brain connectivity. The first part describes the molecular biology and cell culture workflows required to generate high quality viral vectors, yielding titers of ~1x10^10 to 5x10^11 genomic copies per milliliter within approximately two weeks. The second part outlines optimized animal procedures, including intracranial injections, perioperative care, and experimental considerations tailored to specific aims and vector variants. Depending on the application, efficient trans-neuronal tracing can be achieved within 1-4 weeks following delivery.",

      "title": "A portable cortical evoked potential operant conditioning system (C-EPOCS): System development",
      "content": "This study presents customizations and evaluations aimed at adapting the Cortical-Evoked Potential Operant Conditioning System (C-EPOCS) into a portable, user-friendly platform for real-time neurofeedback applications. A primary goal was to simplify the component-heavy setup by integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) data acquisition into a single system-while still supporting cortical and muscle response assessment and real-time feedback. One key limitation of portable biosignal acquisition systems is their typically lower sampling rates (e.g., 300-600 Hz) compared to high-resolution systems (e.g., 3200 Hz), which are commonly used for detecting transient responses such as the H-reflex and M-wave. In a CEPOCS setup, these responses are useful for determining the target stimulation intensity and minimizing inter-session variability in effective afferent excitation. We evaluated whether lower-resolution EMG signals could still support the generation of H-reflex and M-wave recruitment curves for determining target stimulation intensity. Results showed that while EMG sampled at ~600 Hz and ~300 Hz produced greater dispersion in recruitment curve data, particularly at 300 Hz, they still yielded comparable estimates for stimulation intensities that elicit Hmax and Mthreshold, the key parameters for C-EPOCS. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of using an automated response delineation algorithm under these conditions. Despite reduced signal clarity, the algorithm reliably identifies M-wave and H-reflex responses in real time. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a portable C-EPOCS system capable of providing immediate feedback based on both EMG and EEG signals. It also offers practical recommendations for selecting acquisition hardware to support reliable signal quality, real-time processing, and portability.",

      "title": "Physiological detection of flow states across varied gameplay workloads",
      "content": "Flow is a cognitive state associated with heightened and seemingly effortless behavioral performance. Pioneering research suggests flow is an optimal cognitive mode for demanding tasks but the physiological underpinnings and identification on acute timescales, particularly across task contexts, remains an active area of research.  Studies have demonstrated flow experiences are ubiquitous, in that they can arise during nearly any type of activity, suggesting flow represents a fundamental mechanism of skill mastery under which sensory inputs are seamlessly coupled to the necessary motor outputs. Cognitively, flow states are accompanied by a sense of complete task immersion, feelings of control, automatic behavior, decreased self-referential thinking and anxiety, changes in the perception of time, and improved affect to the point that arduous tasks can become autotelic, or self-rewarding. As wearable sensor technology continues to advance, the identification and manipulation of cognitive states in real-time is increasingly becoming a reality, with the potential to revolutionize learning, treatment of neurological disorders, and optimize task performance in domains ranging from professional sports to industry. This study aims to capture flow states from physiological measures so that they might be identified through wearable sensors coupled to machine-learning pipelines. In this work, models are made to predict high behavioral performance across disparately varied task conditions using multimodal physiological data, and these behavioral bouts are loosely correlated to participant responses to traditional flow state survey questions.",

      "content": "Animals often face conflicting decisions to ensure survival. Under food limitation, cannibalism can provide a nutritional advantage despite substantial costs. In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, feeding is essential for successful metamorphosis, making food source decisions critical. We find that dead conspecifics act as attractive cues, but this attraction is weak for live larval groups. It is enhanced when dead larvae are injured or homogenized, or after repeated exposure. Larvae are also more attracted to dead individuals from other Drosophila or insect species. Testing live larvae individually revealed the strongest attraction, indicating that social context suppresses feeding-related attraction. Attraction to dead conspecifics depends on multiple chemosensory and mechanosensory modalities, highlighting the complex integration of social and nutritional cues in larval decision-making. Our results indicate that fly larvae flexibly balance attraction and avoidance based on social context to optimize resource use under ecological constraints.",

      "title": "Impaired gephyrin G-domain trimerization and phase separation in a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy",
      "content": "Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder is frequently linked to genetic variants in synaptic proteins. Here, we describe a de novo pathogenic missense variant in the gephyrin G-domain (G134R) identified in an epileptic patient with developmental delay and seizures. Functional analyses reveal that G134R disrupts higher-order oligomerization, leading to impaired liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and synaptic clustering. Recombinant G134R-gephyrin variant forms lower oligomers with reduced molybdenum cofactor (Moco) synthesis. In non-neuronal cells, G134R fails to oligomerize beyond dimers and loses Moco synthesis function. In neurons, G134R is unable to form synaptic clusters and exerts a dominant-negative effect on WT-gephyrin, severely disrupting inhibitory synapse formation. Our findings highlight a critical role for the G-domain in gephyrin self-assembly and LLPS, shifting the focus from the E-domain-centric view of gephyrin function and providing a novel molecular mechanism for epilepsy linked to G-domain mutations.",

      "title": "Emotional modulation of visual cortical reactivation during true and false memories",
      "content": "Previous research revealed that memory retrieval is associated with a reactivation of sensory cortices reflecting the content of the memory. Further, such reactivation is stronger when retrieval is cued with emotional information as compared with neutral information. However, past studies focused on correct retrieval, and it remains unknown whether a similar reactivation occurs during memory errors, and whether this is enhanced in emotional contexts. Here, we hypothesized that emotion may influence memory errors due to an increase of sensory cortical reactivation at the cost of recovering episodic details (i.e. leading to incorrect retrieval of non-specific associations shared with other cues). We compared brain activations during successful memory retrieval and memory errors in 18 healthy participants who encoded unique negative or neutral scenes paired with one of four associated faces, shared with other trials. Participants were tested the next day with a scene-cued associative retrieval test, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results from a face-responsive region of interest in fusiform cortex (unlike a control place-responsive region in parahippocampal cortex) showed stronger activation for both Hits ('Old' | Target) and False Alarms ('Old' | Foil), as compared with Misses ('New' | Target) and Correct Rejections ('New' | Foil). The emotional content of scene cues did not modulate activation patterns during correct retrieval but produced specific effects on Misattribution errors (incorrect 'Old' | Target, i.e., retrieval of an incorrect face cued by a previously seen scene). Specifically, Misattributions were accompanied by increased fusiform activation comparable to Hits when cued by negative scenes, but low fusiform activation similar to Misses when cued by neutral scenes. Unlike Misattributions, however, Hits cued by emotional information recruited a distinctive network previously linked to personal episodic memories, including medial prefrontal, cingulate, and hippocampal regions, together with enhanced functional coupling between the latter and fusiform cortex. No implicit effect of previous face exposure was observed in the fusiform during Misses, regardless of emotion context. Our results suggest that the reactivation of sensory areas follows subjective memory experience during retrieval, and that emotion can enhance such mechanism when the cue is recognized but detailed episodic memory mediated by fronto-hippocampal circuits is absent, leading to the retrieval of inappropriate associations and false memories.",

      "title": "Selective Age-Related Changes in Brain Network Connectivity During Young Adulthood: Sensory Networks Decrease While Hub Networks Remain Stable",
      "content": "Young adulthood (ages 22-35 years) represents an important period for brain development, yet mechanisms underlying age-related connectivity changes remain poorly understood. We examined developmental trajectories in 66 healthy young adults (22 per age group: 22-25, 26-30, 31-35 years) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from the Human Connectome Project. Contrary to expectations of global increases, we found selective age-related changes: sensory networks (visual and auditory) showed significant decreases in connectivity with age (visual: slope = -0.0133, p = 0.038; auditory: slope = -0.0184, p = 0.012), while hub networks (default mode and frontoparietal) and other networks remained stable (all p > 0.15). Network coupling analysis revealed a mechanistic explanation: sensory networks decouple from hub networks with age (DMN-AUD: change = -0.77; DMN-VIS: change = -0.56), while sensory networks show increased coupling with each other (VIS-AUD: +0.18). This decoupling explains why only sensory networks show age-related changes, as they become independent from hub networks during young adulthood. Importantly, total IQ showed no significant association with network connectivity (all |r| < 0.10, all p > 0.43), strengthening the developmental interpretation. Machine learning revealed the somatomotor network was most predictive of age. All effects remained consistent after controlling for head motion and across sexes. These results demonstrate selective, network-specific developmental trajectories during young adulthood, with sensory networks becoming independent from hub networks and showing age-related decreases, while hub networks maintain stability.",
