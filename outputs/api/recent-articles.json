      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

      "title": "Multivariate genetic architecture of poor sleep quality",
      "content": "The field of genetics has yet to elucidate the complex genetic underpinnings that influence sleep quality. Previous studies have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on different dimensions of sleep health, but have not directly analyzed the multivariate genetic structure of poor sleep quality (PSQ). To address this knowledge gap, we employed a multifaceted approach that incorporated Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (Genomic-SEM) and multiple Post-GWAS methods. This strategy enabled us to identify causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to the variability in poor sleep quality. Our study identified a total of 14 leading SNP loci (such as rs2820309) and 3 fine-mapping significant loci (such as KTN1: rs77168063). To further investigate the underlying mechanisms, we employed multiple whole-transcriptome association methods. These methods analyzed susceptible gene signal loci that exhibited strong correlation with poor sleep quality, as determined by tissue, cell layer, and genome component analysis, along with related component information. Subsequently, data on approximately 13,000 common diseases were evaluated to determine the associated predisposing factors for poor sleep quality, and the correlation between poor sleep quality and 20 common neurological diseases was assessed. Additionally, we utilized a polygenic score based on summary data to analyze evidence of risk for poor sleep quality across different chromosomes. This study offers a novel perspective on the genetic underpinnings of poor sleep quality by conducting a genome-wide association study for a phenotype that was not directly measured.",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers a non-invasive method to monitor cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamic changes in real time. Transient hemodynamic instability during carotid artery stenting (CAS) may compromise blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) integrity and cerebral homeostasis, highlighting the need for sensitive intraoperative monitoring. Compared with traditional dual-channel NIRS systems limited to the frontal region, multi-channel fNIRS enables spatially resolved assessment of cortical hemodynamics and may provide a valuable adjunct for cerebroprotection research. We retrospectively analyzed five consecutive patients who underwent CAS under local anesthesia, with continuous multi-channel fNIRS monitoring before, during, and after the procedure. Forty-five cortical channels covering bilateral anterior circulation were recorded. Changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration (\u0394[OxyHb]) and its standard deviation around key procedural events were analyzed to evaluate cortical oxygenation dynamics. All five procedures were technically successful, reducing residual stenosis to less than 30%. fNIRS consistently revealed increased cortical oxygenation following angioplasty and stent deployment, indicating improved cerebral perfusion. In four patients, transient fluctuations in cortical oxygenation corresponded to perioperative hemodynamic instability, such as bradycardia or hypotension induced by carotid sinus reflex. In one patient, marked declines in cortical oxygenation preceded transient neurological deficits, with recovery parallel to blood pressure normalization. These findings suggest that multi-channel fNIRS can sensitively capture both global and regional alterations in cerebral oxygenation during CAS, providing real-time insight into perfusion dynamics potentially linked to BBB function and cerebroprotection. Future studies integrating fNIRS with BBB-targeted markers may help refine intraoperative neuroprotection strategies in stroke and vascular interventions.",

      "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08652v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Every day life tasks can present significant challenges for neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) who are characterized by specific sensitivities. This contribution describes a virtual reality system that allows neurodivergent individuals to experience everyday situations in order to practice and implement strategies for overcoming their daily challenges. The key strength of the proposed system is the automatic personalization of the virtual environment, based on both the individual's abilities and their specific training needs. The proposed method has been evaluated on four synthetic user profiles, also proposing a metric able to evaluate the variance of the features within the same difficulty level. The results show that the method can produce a significant number of scenarios for the various difficulty levels. Furthermore, within the same difficulty, there is a wide variance of the non-constrained features for the specific profile.",

      "title": "Rewriting Video: Text-Driven Reauthoring of Video Footage",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.08565v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Video is a powerful medium for communication and storytelling, yet reauthoring existing footage remains challenging. Even simple edits often demand expertise, time, and careful planning, constraining how creators envision and shape their narratives. Recent advances in generative AI suggest a new paradigm: what if editing a video were as straightforward as rewriting text? To investigate this, we present a tech probe and a study on text-driven video reauthoring. Our approach involves two technical contributions: (1) a generative reconstruction algorithm that reverse-engineers video into an editable text prompt, and (2) an interactive probe, Rewrite Kit, that allows creators to manipulate these prompts. A technical evaluation of the algorithm reveals a critical human-AI perceptual gap. A probe study with 12 creators surfaced novel use cases such as virtual reshooting, synthetic continuity, and aesthetic restyling. It also highlighted key tensions around coherence, control, and creative alignment in this new paradigm. Our work contributes empirical insights into the opportunities and challenges of text-driven video reauthoring, offering design implications for future co-creative video tools.",

      "title": "Characterizing Personality from Eye-Tracking: The Role of Gaze and Its Absence in Interactive Search Environments",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.08287v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Personality traits influence how individuals engage, behave, and make decisions during the information-seeking process. However, few studies have linked personality to observable search behaviors. This study aims to characterize personality traits through a multimodal time-series model that integrates eye-tracking data and gaze missingness-periods when the user's gaze is not captured. This approach is based on the idea that people often look away when they think, signaling disengagement or reflection. We conducted a user study with 25 participants, who used an interactive application on an iPad, allowing them to engage with digital artifacts from a museum. We rely on raw gaze data from an eye tracker, minimizing preprocessing so that behavioral patterns can be preserved without substantial data cleaning. From this perspective, we trained models to predict personality traits using gaze signals. Our results from a five-fold cross-validation study demonstrate strong predictive performance across all five dimensions: Neuroticism (Macro F1 = 77.69%), Conscientiousness (74.52%), Openness (77.52%), Agreeableness (73.09%), and Extraversion (76.69%). The ablation study examines whether the absence of gaze information affects the model performance, demonstrating that incorporating missingness improves multimodal time-series modeling. The full model, which integrates both time-series signals and missingness information, achieves 10-15% higher accuracy and macro F1 scores across all Big Five traits compared to the model without time-series signals and missingness. These findings provide evidence that personality can be inferred from search-related gaze behavior and demonstrate the value of incorporating missing gaze data into time-series multimodal modeling.",

      "title": "Data-Induced Groupings and How To Find Them",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.08256v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Making sense of a visualization requires the reader to consider both the visualization design and the underlying data values. Existing work in the visualization community has largely considered affordances driven by visualization design elements, such as color or chart type, but how visual design interacts with data values to impact interpretation and reasoning has remained under-explored. Dot plots and bar graphs are commonly used to help users identify groups of points that form trends and clusters, but are liable to manifest groupings that are artifacts of spatial arrangement rather than inherent patterns in the data itself. These ``Data-induced Groups'' can drive suboptimal data comparisons and potentially lead the user to incorrect conclusions. We conduct two user studies using dot plots as a case study to understand the prevalence of data-induced groupings. We find that users rely on data-induced groupings in both conditions despite the fact that trend-based groupings are irrelevant in nominal data. Based on the study results, we build a model to predict whether users are likely to perceive a given set of dot plot points as a group. We discuss two use cases illustrating how the model can assist visualization designers by both diagnosing potential user-perceived groupings in dot plots and offering redesigns that better accentuate desired groupings through data rearrangement.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08203v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extended reality serious games for mental health are a promising research avenue to address the accessibility gap in mental health treatment by bringing therapy to patients in their homes, offering highly adaptable and immersive yet safe therapy opportunities, and increasing motivation and engagement with therapeutic exercises. However, the sensitive use case of mental health demands thoughtful integration with mental health concepts and a comprehensive understanding of prior literature. This paper presents a scoping literature review of the ISMAR, IEEEVR, and TVCG communities to assess the contributions of the XR community to the mental health serious game domain and explore potential weaknesses and strengths for future work by XR researchers. To this end, this review identified 204 possibly relevant articles in the XR community and fully evaluated 6 XR serious games for mental health. This relatively small number of articles for final inclusion suggests that XR mental health serious games are largely underexplored by the XR community (or not reported within the XR community). There is value in exploring the existing literature space as it is. Thus, this paper evaluates these six papers in terms of game elements and underlying psychological foundations, and discuss future directions for XR researchers in this wide-open research space within our community.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.08194v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational agents are increasingly expected to adapt across contexts and evolve their personalities through interactions, yet most remain static once configured. We present an exploratory study of how user expectations form and evolve when agent personality is made dynamically adjustable. To investigate this, we designed a prototype conversational interface that enabled users to adjust an agent's personality along eight research-grounded dimensions across three task contexts: informational, emotional, and appraisal. We conducted an online mixed-methods study with 60 participants, employing latent profile analysis to characterize personality classes and trajectory analysis to trace evolving patterns of personality adjustment. These approaches revealed distinct personality profiles at initial and final configuration stages, and adjustment trajectories, shaped by context-sensitivity. Participants also valued the autonomy, perceived the agent as more anthropomorphic, and reported greater trust. Our findings highlight the importance of designing conversational agents that adapt alongside their users, advancing more responsive and human-centred AI.",
