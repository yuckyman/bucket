      "title": "The anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug valproic acid attracts C. elegans and activates chemosensory neurons via a cGMP signaling pathway",
      "content": "Valproic acid (VPA) is a drug with both anticonvulsant and antimanic properties. It has been widely prescribed to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions for decades, but its molecular mode of action in the brain is not fully known. Moreover, prenatal exposure to this drug is linked to developmental anomalies, cognitive deficits, and an increased risk of autism. To determine VPA's effect on the nervous system without requiring systemic drug application and inducing toxic effects, we exploited the well-characterized chemotaxis behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that C. elegans are attracted to VPA, and this behavior is missing in animals lacking the tax-4 ion channel and the tax-4-expressing AWC chemosensory neurons. To test the idea that VPA directly activates the AWC neurons, we performed calcium imaging studies in a line expressing GCaMP6s in all amphid chemosensory neurons in the head. We found that VPA evoked calcium transients consistently in the AWC neurons and variably in AWB and ASH. As cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, the active state of tax-4 increases upon the binding of cGMP. Within the worm's chemosensory nervous system, receptor guanylate cyclases (rGCs) facilitate the synthesis of cGMP and serve as chemoreceptors for various chemical cues. By performing chemotaxis assays and calcium imaging experiments with rGC mutants against VPA, we found that odr-1 and gcy-28 are essential for mediating VPA attraction, as their absence disrupts both behavior and control AWC calcium transients. However, given their broad use in chemosensation, odr-1 and gcy-28 most likely act as downstream effectors rather than as direct targets. These findings compelled us to investigate whether chemoreceptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family contribute to VPA sensing. We approached this hypothesis by conducting chemotaxis assays with G mutants and identified several (odr-3, egl-30, gpa-2;gpa-3) whose absence leads to a loss of VPA attraction. Thus, future studies should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which GPCRs contribute to VPA sensing and cGMP signaling.",

      "title": "Neurogenesis Leads Early Development in Zebrafish",
      "content": "Vertebrate early neurogenesis is a highly conserved process fundamental to brain function and the emergence of intelligence. However, the cellular dynamics bridging gastrulation and organogenesis remain elusive due to observational challenges. We developed a live-cell imaging platform for transgenic zebrafish that provides, for the first time, a continuous reconstruction of early neurogenesis across subcellular to organismal scales. Our analysis reveals that neurogenesis is a precisely orchestrated process. Neuronal cell bodies initially coalesce into discrete, linearly arranged clusters extending from the brain along the spinal cord. From these hubs, axons radiate outward to innervate the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, including the yolk sac surface. A primary pioneer neuron projects from the brain, coursing ventrally in parallel to the body axis. Secondary neurons then interconnect, forming a pervasive network that is subsequently refined through selective axonal apoptosis. The emergence of frequent Ca2+ flashes only after structural maturation indicates that functionality is contingent upon an established scaffold. We also observe concurrent material transport and a slow, directional flow of Ca2+ along axons, suggesting complementary signaling modalities. Furthermore, neurogenesis exhibits precise spatiotemporal coupling with histogenesis, particularly with the developing lateral line and vasculature. Our work, with refined spatial and time resolution, defines the kinetic pathway of early neurogenesis and underscores the critical interplay of subsystems in embryogenesis, offering fundamental insights for neural health and bio-inspired intelligence.",

      "content": "Deficient extinction learning and memory are hypothesized mechanisms for pathological anxiety that are associated with sleep disturbance. fMRI neural activations to threat conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction recall were measured. Activations were compared, in persons with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), between those with moderate to severe Insomnia Disorder (ID) and those with absent or sub-threshold ID. Relationships of activations with measures of sleep quality and physiology were examined. Between-group comparisons and whole-sample correlation with sleep parameters were examined in relation to large-scale brain networks using a liberal cluster-determining threshold. Localized activations were then identified using familywise error correction. Activations to the reinforced stimulus (CS+) that increased from the beginning to end (across) threat conditioning were more extensive within the GAD+ID group. Increased activations to the CS+ across extinction learning were greater within the GAD-ID than the GAD+ID group, and delayed 24h in the latter. Greater sleep efficiency was associated with decreased activations across threat conditioning, but with increased activations across extinction learning. Better sleep quality promoted greater engagement of neural substrates of extinction learning. The GAD+ID group failed to engage brain areas supporting extinction learning immediately following threat conditioning, but did so when stimuli were again presented following a delay.",

      "content": "The brain relies on external landmarks to anchor internal spatial representations. The neural mechanisms underlying this process and the sources of landmark signals remain unknown in mammals. Here, we simultaneously recorded single neurons across five parahippocampal regions in rats navigating a virtual reality environment that preserved natural locomotion. Area 29e, an understudied parahippocampal field, displayed strong locking to visual landmarks under conditions in which neurons in the other regions, such as the medial entorhinal cortex, decoupled their spatial firing from the landmarks. Compared to the other regions, area 29e neurons also displayed weaker theta modulation, stronger gamma rhythmicity, stronger egocentric head-direction tuning, and enhanced landmark contrast sensitivity. The loss of landmark anchoring in non-29e parahippocampal neurons was preceded by a decline of gamma-band influence from 29e to medial entorhinal cortex. Together, these findings position 29e as a specialized visuospatial hub that may carry landmark signals for anchoring parahippocampal representations of space to the external world.",
