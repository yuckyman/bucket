      "title": "A TRANSPARENT WHEEL-BASED PLATFORM FOR LOCOMOTION-ON-DEMAND AND MULTIMODAL BODY AND FACIAL KINEMATICS IN HEAD-FIXED MICE",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain transforms sensory input and internal state into coordinated action requires behavioral paradigms that provide precise, multimodal measurements of movement and arousal while remaining compatible with neural recording techniques. Here we present a modular, low-cost behavioral platform that enables locomotion-on-demand in head-fixed mice using a transparent running wheel combined with air-stream-induced stimulation. This design provides unobstructed visual access to ventral paw movements while simultaneously capturing whole-body kinematics, facial motion, and eye-related signals from multiple camera perspectives. The system integrates Arduino-based stimulus control, high-resolution encoder measurements, Raspberry Pi-based videography, and LED-driven temporal synchronization across independently acquired data streams. Using a proof-of-principle dataset from a single, well-trained animal, we demonstrate that air delivery reliably induces structured locomotion with reproducible trial timing on a transparent wheel. Optical-flow-based motion metrics and DeepLabCut pose estimation reveal robust, stimulus-locked increases in paw, limb, and facial movements during air-on epochs relative to air-off periods. LED-based synchronization enables accurate segmentation of stimulus epochs across video modalities despite differences in sampling rates, with air-on durations showing strong agreement between video-derived and DAQ-recorded measures. Correlation analyses further reveal state-dependent reorganization of coordinated body kinematics during locomotion, indicating structured coupling among limb and whole-body measures rather than a uniform increase in movement. This work establishes a flexible framework for studying stimulus-evoked locomotion and provides a platform well suited for integration with neural imaging and electrophysiology, as well as for future investigations of sensorimotor coordination and behavioral state changes in health and disease.",

      "title": "Cortical microglia promote noradrenergic signaling to maintain wakefulness",
      "content": "Microglia are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis, including the sleep-wake cycle, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, using in vivo two-photon imaging in both head-fixed and freely moving mice with simultaneous electroencephalogram-electromyogram (EEG-EMG) recording, we investigated microglial process dynamics and their interactions with locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic (NE) axons in the frontal cortex across sleep-wake states. During sleep or chemogenetic suppression of LC neurons, microglia enhanced their surveillance and increased interactions with NE axons. Correlative electron microscopy at nanometer resolution identified structural contacts between microglial process endings and NE boutons. Mechanistically, microglia-bouton interaction is primed by NE-{beta}2-adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AR) signaling, leading to enhanced Ca2+activity in NE axons. These findings suggest that microglial interactions with NE axons promote cortical norepinephrine transmission and maintain stable wakefulness.",

      "title": "Rod-cone signal interference impairs mesopic motion discriminability in a model circuit",
      "content": "Under mesopic conditions, such as dawn or dusk, signals from both rod and cone photoreceptors contribute to perception. These parallel inputs are combined within the retina before being sent to subsequent visual areas. The integration of these kinetically-distinct parallel signals poses unique challenges for human vision. Though previous behavioral studies have found that dim lighting conditions specifically impair motion perception in human subjects, the origin of this dependence is unclear. In the present study, we create a model circuit that predicts ganglion cell responses to moving stimuli by incorporating electrophysiologically-derived circuit components into a Hassenstein-Reichardt correlator, a classical motion-detection model. The model circuit demonstrates that interactions between rod- and cone-derived signals negatively impact the encoding of a moving object's direction under mesopic conditions. Furthermore, we found that the model circuit could enhance its motion discriminability if it was only sensitive to the cone-activating components of the stimuli. We conclude that rod-cone signal interference occurring at the lowest level of vision has an impact on motion direction discrimination, a higher-level task with relevance for behavior.",

      "title": "Multimodal Data Fusion Reveals Morpho-Genetic Variations in Human Cortical Neurons Associated with Tumor Infiltration",
      "content": "We introduce LetsACT (Light-Electron-Transcriptome synergistic ACTomography), a multimodal integration platform that overcomes the limitations of single-modality data acquisition and analysis of human brain cells while synergistically leveraging the strengths of each modality. Our approach enables the rapid sample preparation, cell injection, imaging, and multimodal integration of large-scale human neuronal datasets at single-cell resolution. By generating initial laser-scanning-microscopy based optical reconstruction of neuron morphologies followed by refining them using electron-microscopy derived morphological priors, we have assembled one of the largest human cortical morphology datasets to date: 8,398 neurons from 58 donors, with high cortical coverage. This platform is then applied to studying morphological impact of tumor infiltration. Pyramidal neurons in glioma-infiltrated tissues display clear volume shrinkage in somas and branches, tapering from the soma to nearby dendritic compartments. By integrating these morphological variations with spatial and bulk transcriptomic profiles, we find that glioblastoma tissues exhibit dysregulation of 15.29% of genes, including overexpression of TERT, whereas infiltrated tissues show 7.74% gene dysregulation, characterized by overexpression of tumor suppressors such as CDKN2A and TP53. Our analysis implies that pyramidal neurons observed in these infiltrated tissues may involve an active defense instead of undergoing passive apoptosis. Our finding also indicates that LetsACT establishes a valuable resource for the large-scale, comprehensive morpho-genetic analysis of human tissues.",

I wanted to share a tool I've been working on to inspect Windows installers (.msi) files without needing to be on Windows or install command line tools -- essentially a web-based version of lessmsi that can run on any system (including mobile Safari on iOS).</p> <p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msi_viewer.html\">https://pymsi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/msi_viewer.html</a></p> <p>Source Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/</a> (see <em>docs/_static/msi_viewer.js</em> for the code using Pyodide)</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>The MSI Viewer and Extractor uses <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">pymsi</a> as the library to read MSI files, and provides an interactive interface for examining MSI installers.</p> <p>It uses <a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\">Pyodide</a> to run code that calls the <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">pymsi</a> library directly in your browser, with some javascript to glue things together with the HTML UI elements. Since it is all running client-side, no files ever get uploaded to a remote server.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Originally it was intended as a quick toy project to see how hard it would be to get <a href=\"https://github.com/nightlark/pymsi/\">pymsi</a> running in a browser with <a href=\"https://pyodide.org/en/stable/\">Pyodide</a>, but I've found it rather convenient in my day job for quickly extracting contents of MSI installers. I'd categorize it as nearly production ready.</p> <p>It is probably most useful for:</p> <ul> <li>Security researchers and sysadmins who need to quickly peek inside an installer without running it setting up a Windows VM</li> <li>Developers who want a uniform cross-platform way of working with MSI files, particularly on macOS/Linux where tools like lessmsi and Orca aren't available</li> <li>Repackaging workflows that need to include a subset of files from existing installers</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <ul> <li>vs Orca/lessmsi: While very capable, they are Windows-only and require a download and for Orca, running an MSI installer pulled from a Windows SDK. This is cross-platform and requires no installation.</li> <li>vs 7-zip: It understands the MSI installer structure and can be used to view data in streams, which 7-zip just dumps as files that aren't human readable. 7-zip for extracting files more often than not results in incorrect file names and lacks any semblance of the directory structure defined by tables in the MSI installer.</li> <li>vs msitools: It does not require any installation, and it also works on Windows, giving consistency across all operating systems.</li> <li>vs other online viewers: It doesn't upload any files to a remote server, and keeps files local to your device.</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nightlark192\"> /u/Nightlark192 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1px67mn/inspect_and_extract_files_from_msi_installers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1px67mn/inspect_and_extract_files_from_msi_installers/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "Huntington disease (HD) is caused by CAG expansion in HTT, yet how somatic repeat instability and huntingtin aggregation relate to selective cell loss in the human brain remains unclear. We have developed a multimodal spatial transcriptomics approach that enables defining transcriptional programs with subcellular resolution, somatic CAG repeat lengths, and six other pathology marks including huntingtin aggregates in every cell of intact brain sections. Imaging 428,173 cells in HD cortex revealed selective vulnerability: L5/6 NP and L6b deep-layer excitatory neurons undergo more than 50% loss, closely linked to very large (more than 380+/-55) somatic expansions. Intranuclear aggregation was most prevalent at intermediate somatic repeat expansion (220-300 CAGs) and was accompanied by broader transcriptional changes. In contrast, chandelier and somatostatin+ inhibitory interneurons are lost despite only modest repeat expansion or aggregation. These data provide a comprehensive resource and establish a broadly applicable framework for connecting repeat expansion and protein pathology across diverse cell types.",

      "title": "Riluzole shifts glial responses to protect synapses and memory in A\u03b2 oligomer-treated rats",
      "content": "Soluble A{beta}1-42 oligomers are potent neurotoxins that disrupt synaptic function, alter glial responses, and lead to memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Riluzole, a glutamate modulator approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, reduces neuronal hyperexcitability, yet its in vivo effects on A{beta} oligomer-induced cognitive dysfunction and glial alterations remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether riluzole ameliorates A{beta}1-42 oligomer-induced memory impairment and associated cellular changes in the hippocampus. A{beta}1-42 oligomers were bilaterally microinjected into the dorsal CA1 region of freely moving male rats, followed by daily riluzole administration for seven days. Behavioral analyses revealed that riluzole significantly improved hippocampus-dependent memory, including contextual learning and spatial working memory, without affecting locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, or pain sensitivity. At the cellular level, riluzole reduced neuronal A{beta} accumulation and attenuated synaptic and dendritic pathology, while increasing A{beta} association with astrocytes and microglia in parallel with enhanced CD11b-related recognition and lysosomal processing. Riluzole also attenuated A{beta}-induced neuronal apoptosis, dendritic degeneration, and dendritic spine loss across multiple hippocampal subregions. In addition, riluzole limited complement-dependent synaptic elimination by microglia and preserved synaptic integrity. Although A{beta} oligomers induced robust recruitment of astrocytes and microglia, riluzole did not suppress glial activation; instead, it promoted morphological remodeling and shifted both astrocytes and microglia toward phenotypes associated with neuroprotection. Together, these findings support the idea that coordinated remodeling of glial responses contributes to the ability of riluzole to counteract A{beta} oligomer toxicity, promoting glia-mediated amyloid handling, synaptic stability, and cognitive recovery.",
