Healthy males had weaker tactile acuity compared to females in TMJ and temporal regions. No significant gender effect on orofacial tactile acuity was observed among male and female patients. The 2-PDTs of the tested sites, especially for TMJ, has the potential for further utilization in pain-related TMDs patients.",

The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

      "title": "Eye Drop Instillation Success and Hand Function in Adults with Glaucoma: A Pilot Study",
      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Despite hand function deficits, in this exploratory pilot study, adults with glaucoma demonstrated eye drop instillation success comparable to those without glaucoma, though with higher rates of bottle tip contact with the eye, skin, or eyelashes, suggesting an increased risk of potential eye drop bottle contamination. These findings suggest that though regular practice may help mitigate the effects of hand function deficits on the targeted activity of getting the eye drop in the...",

      "title": "Functional evidence for early origin of tactile acuity in the vertebrate somatosensory system",
      "content": "Mammals and reptiles possess a sophisticated somatosensory system for precise tactile discrimination via mechanosensory end-organs, such as Meissner and Pacinian corpuscles and others. These structures detect sustained pressure, velocity, and vibrations, thereby facilitating nuanced environmental interactions. It is not known whether the ancestral anamniotic somatosensory system, typically lacking such structures, provides comparable tactile discrimination. Here, we investigate the...",

      "content": "Touch plays a key role in our perception of our body and shapes our interactions with the world, from the objects we manipulate to the people we touch. While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",

The data set is uniquely curated, combining ground-truth data from Kaggle and real-world samples collected from blind schools, segmented into vowels and consonants. The proposed system demonstrates exceptional performance in feature extraction, classification accuracy, and addressing spatial misalignments in...",
