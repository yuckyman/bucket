      "title": "Nighttime sleep modulates mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila",
      "content": "Organisms must focus their attention on ethologically relevant stimuli to maximise survival and reproduction. This is achieved, in part, through a process termed habituation, in which responses to repeated or constant sensory inputs are sequentially dampened, favouring robust responses to novel stimuli. Prior investigations in the fruit fly, Drosophila, have uncovered genes and neural mechanisms that facilitate habituation. However, these works have primarily focused on habituation to visual, olfactory, and gustatory, stimuli. In contrast, neurogenetic processes promoting habituation to mechanosensory stimuli have been less studied. Here we develop an automated system that yields long-term analogue measurements of mechanosensory habituation in adult fruit flies. Using this platform, we reveal a role for the neuronal calcium sensor Neurocalcin in habituation to mechanical stimuli. Loss of Neurocalcin disrupts nighttime but not daytime sleep, particularly under long-night conditions. Mimicking a method used to treat insomnia, we show that compressing nighttime duration restores consolidated night sleep in Neurocalcin mutants. Surprisingly, this manipulation also renormalises mechanosensory habituation in this background, suggesting a link between sleep and mechanosensory habituation. Indeed, we show that limiting night sleep duration in wild type flies similarly impairs habituation to mechanosensory stimuli. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated link between nighttime sleep and mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila.",

      "title": "Selective engagement of the primate orbitofrontal cortex during value-based but not perceptual decisions",
      "content": "A fundamental question in neuroscience is whether the brain uses specialized sub-systems for different types of decisions or relies on a unified decision-making network. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) provides an ideal test case for this question: it has a well-established role in value-based decisions but it remains unknown whether this reflects functional specialization or participation in a broader, general decision network. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used Neuropixels to monitor large ensembles of OFC neurons as a monkey performed both value-based and perceptual decision tasks. Consistent with prior reports, OFC was robustly engaged during value-based decisions. In contrast, OFC was minimally engaged during perceptual decisions, with no significant encoding of task parameters at either the single neuron or population level. This highlights the functional specialization of the OFC for value-based decisions and suggests that the different cognitive demands underlying different types of decisions recruit distinct neural circuits.",

      "content": "ObjectiveBased on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), signal mining of adverse drug events (AEs) caused by Botulinum Toxin Type A (BoNTA) was performed to explore its safety implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy (CP).MethodsThe OpenVigil 2.1 platform was used to extract AE reports on BoNTA from the FAERS database, covering the period from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2024. Safety data were analyzed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), with BoNTA designated as the primary suspect drug.ResultsA total of 124,538 AE reports related to BoNTA were identified, showing an overall upward trend in the annual report counts. Most reports originated from the United States, with patients predominantly aged 36\u201360\u202fyears and predominantly female. Prolonged hospitalization was the most frequently reported serious adverse event. Signal analysis identified 325 disproportionately reported events across 21 system-organ classes (SOCs). The top five preferred terms (PTs) by frequency were eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, muscle weakness, blurred vision, and injection site swelling. The top five PTs based on signal strength were brow ptosis, Mephisto sign, botulism, bizarre personal appearance, and neuromuscular toxicity. Notable lowest-level terms (LLTs) included eye swelling, injection site edema, facial pain, facial discomfort, increased residual urine volume, blurred vision, and eyelid swelling.ConclusionIn clinical practice involving BoNTA for CP treatment, clinicians should pay close attention to these identified signals. Strengthened pre-injection evaluation and post-injection monitoring are recommended to enable early detection and timely intervention, ensuring medication safety for patients.",

The final dataset included 598 samples, with an SCD incidence rate of 26.12%. The data were randomly divided into a training set (n = 418). A validation set (n = 180) at a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, prediction models for SCD were constructed using logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and neural network algorithms. Model performance on the validation set was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. SHAP values were used for model interpretability analysis.ResultsThe SVM model showed good performance in the training set, with an AUC of 0.82, indicating strong predictive ability. Information Overload (IO), Self-Perception (SP), Energy Level (EL), Depressive Emotion (DE), Gender (SEX), Risk Decision (RD), and Short-Term Memory (STM) were important feature variables for SCD occurrence.ConclusionThis study successfully developed an SVM-based model for screening the risk of SCD. The SVM model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and traditional LR models.",

      "content": "ObjectivesSturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a congenital neurological disorder occurring in the early childhood. Timely diagnosis of SWS is essential for proper medical intervention that prevents the development of various neurological issues. Leptomeningeal angiomas (LA) are the clinical manifestation of SWS. Detection of LA is currently performed by manual inspection of the magnetic resonance images (MRI) by experienced neurologist, which is time-consuming and lack of inter-rater consistency. The aim of the present study is to investigate automated LA detection in MRI of SWS patients.MethodsA Mamba-based encoder-decoder architecture was employed in the present study. Particularly, a multi-scale multi-scan strategy was proposed to convert 3-D volume into 1-D sequence, enabling capturing long-range dependency with reduced computation complexity. Our dataset consists of 40 SWS patients with T1-enhanced MRI. The proposed model was first pre-trained on a public brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) dataset and then fine-tuned and tested on the SWS dataset using 5-fold cross validation.Results and conclusionOur results show excellent performance of the proposed method, e.g., Dice score of 91.53% and 78.67% for BraTS and SWS, respectively, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods as well as two neurologists. Mamba-based deep learning method can automatically identify LA in MRI images, enabling automated SWS diagnosis in clinical settings.",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge.

      "content": "IntroductionStandardized treadmill-based balance disturbances have potential to improve assessments of dynamic balance control in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here we examined the validity of a step threshold task to measure dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThirty-nine participants with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease underwent clinical testing and performed a dynamic balance assessment both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. For the assessment, participants were instructed to avoid stepping in response to progressively larger postural perturbations applied via treadmill translations. The step threshold was defined as the perturbation magnitude that resulted in a stepping response on four consecutive trials. Validity was assessed by correlating medication-mediated changes in gold standard clinical measures and medication-mediated changes in stepping.ResultsMedication-mediated changes in step threshold correlated with changes in MDS-UPDRS part III (p < 0.01), with change in MDS-UPDRS 3.12 postural instability (p < 0.05), and with measures of executive function: CPT-3 Omission T-score (p = 0.013), the CPT-3 Commission T-score (p = 0.019), and the CPT-3 Variability T-score (p = 0.040).DiscussionOur results validate step threshold task as a measure of dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Correlations with gold standard assessments of motor and executive function suggest that the step threshold task can serve as a comprehensive measure of dynamic balance control.",

      "title": "The effects of aquatic and land-based interventions on children with developmental coordination disorder",
      "content": "BackgroundKnowledge about the effects of aquatic intervention on children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD), as well as the maintenance of these effects over time, is still scarce. We believe that there is a need to advance our knowledge of this subject, for which we have set ourselves the following objectives: (1) to test whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions influence the motor performance of children with DCD; (2) to check whether these effects persist over time; and (3) whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions bring motor performance values closer together between children with DCD and those with typical development.Methods76 children aged between 6 and 10 years old were divided into four groups, control developmental coordination disorder (C-DCD); control typical development (C-TD); experimental terrestrial developmental coordination disorder (T-DCD); and experimental aquatic developmental coordination disorder (A-DCD). Due to some dropouts, the final sample consisted of 66 children, 27 girls and 39 boys. The groups of children with DCD were randomized according to their initial total score on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Test - second edition (MABC-2). The analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) carried out in the pre-test showed similarity between the means of the DCD groups (C-DCD, T-DCD and A-DCD), which ensured that these groups started from the same performance level. The interventions lasted 4.5 months (18 weeks) with three sessions a week, totaling 54 sessions of 60 min each. The experimental groups took part in the same intervention protocol, with the only difference being the environment (A-DCD = aquatic environment; T-DCD = terrestrial environment).ResultsAnalysis of the results revealed no significant effect for the group and time point interaction, F(6, 133) = 1.36, p = 0.235. However, effects were detected for group, F(2, 54.7) = 3.78, p < 0.05, and for time point F(3, 131) = 22.91, p < 0.001. The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test found a difference between the T-DCD and C-DCD groups (p < 0.05; independent-groups effect size (dig = 0.85; dig = 0.87; dig = 0.92). For time point, differences were found between the pre-test and the other time points [post-intervention (repeated measures effect size) (dR,M = 1.14), 3 months post-test (dR,M = 1.51) and 6 months post-test (dR,M = 2.2)] with a significance level of p < 0.001. For the A-DCD group there was no statistically significant difference in relation to either the C-DCD or T-DCD group, but we did observe large effect size values [pre-test and post-test (dR,M = 1.14), pre-test and 3 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.29) and pre-test and 6 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.61)]. Regarding the analysis of the Z score, the results indicated an interaction effect for the group and time point F(6, 132) = 2.30, p = 0.038. This difference was located by post hoc between the C-DCD group and the A-DCD (p < 0.05; independent groups pre-test - post-test effect size (digpp = 1.72) and dig = 0.79) and T-DCD (p < 0.05 ES digpp = 1.65 and dig = 0.79) groups at 6 months-post-test.ConclusionWe conclude that both aquatic and terrestrial interventions have positive effects on the motor performance of children with DCD, that these effects are maintained over time but also bring the motor performance of children with DCD closer to that of children with typical development.",

      "title": "New gait performance indices and cognitive functions: a pilot study on correlation in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and involves impairment of both motor and cognitive functions, significantly affecting the quality of walking and consequently the quality of life of people affected by this disease. This study analyzed the relationship between gait alterations and cognitive deterioration, using validated clinical tests and an innovative indicator, the \u03c6-bonacci gait number, which quantifies gait harmonicity, symmetry, and consistency. Kinematic data collected during the 6-Minute Walk test on 19 people with PD (pwPD) and 15 healthy adults were analyzed. The results highlighted a significant negative correlation between gait harmonicity and cognitive performance (\u03c6-bonacci gait number\u2014Time Up and Go Dual Task; r\u202f=\u202f0.797, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Finally, mediation analysis showed that global cognitive function (MoCA) indirectly influences gait harmonicity through TUG-DT. The results suggest that gait in pwPD is strongly modulated by executive-attentional functions, supporting its cognitive modulation rather than a purely automatic nature. This study allowed to explore the complex relationship between cognitive functions and the motor system, deepening how these interactions influence and refine motor behavior. Therefore, rehabilitation programs combining motor exercises and cognitive training could be more effective in improving gait quality, reducing the risk of falls, and improving person\u2019s quality of life.",

      "content": "IntroductionCognitive impairment is a prevalent nonmotor symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), significantly affecting patients\u2019 quality of life. Considering the gap in understanding the relationship between cognitive impairments in Parkinson\u2019s disease and executive function, this study aimed to investigate the association between three cognitive statutes: normal cognition condition (PD-NCC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and mild dementia (PDD), and the performance of the Anterior Attentional System in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 96 participants with Parkinson\u2019s disease (45 with PD-NCC, 39 with PD-MCI, and 12 with PDD) and 46 participants from control group, recruited between 2020 and 2023. MDS-UPDRS was used during the neurological examination. To assess cognitive status, we used: Mini-Mental State Examination, Californian Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (A and B form). The ROtman Baycrest Battery was employed to evaluate the Anterior Attentional System.ResultsParticipants with PDD exhibited significant impairments in the Anterior Attentional System. Energization impairment was observed in PD-MCI and PDD, though mildly. Monitoring and task-setting processes were notably impaired only in individuals with PDD, while these functions remained intact in those with PD-NCC and PD-MCI.ConclusionThe Anterior Attentional System is well-preserved in PD-NCC and PD-MCI however notably disturbed in PDD.",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "From Play to Detection: Mini-SPACE as a Serious Game for Unsupervised Cognitive Impairment Screening",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.12068v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Early detection of Cognitive Impairment (CI) is critical for timely intervention, preservation of independence, and reducing the burden of dementia. Yet, most screening tools remain lengthy, clinic-based, and poorly suited for large-scale unsupervised deployment. This paper evaluates the test-retest reliability, validity, and usability of mini-SPACE, a short iPad-based serious game for detecting early signs of CI. Participants played mini-SPACE at home without supervision once a week for three weeks, with a longer version of the game in the final week. Mini-SPACE showed good test-retest reliability in unsupervised settings. While younger age was the primary predictor of performance, usability, and cognitive load, participants of all ages were able to complete the tasks and reported good usability and low cognitive load. Importantly, the prediction of scores in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) improved with repeated measures. These findings highlight mini-SPACE as a promising digital marker for scalable, age-sensitive screening and potential longitudinal tracking of CI.",
