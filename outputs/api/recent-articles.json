      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Disruption of theta-timescale spiking impairs learning but spares hippocampal replay",
      "content": "The ability to rapidly learn and retrieve salient information about new environments is critical for survival. In mammals, the hippocampus plays a crucial role in that learning. Specialized features of hippocampal population coding, including network-level theta oscillatory activity, location-specific firing of principal cells, and reactivation of experience during immobility (replay), have been implicated in rapid storage and retrieval of spatial information. Disruptions of theta and replay jointly, or replay alone, are sufficient to impair learning; however, the specific contribution of theta-associated temporal structure during locomotion remains unknown. In this study, we manipulated hippocampal spiking activity in rats specifically during locomotion by optogenetically activating septal parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons. We developed a closed-loop, theta phase-specific stimulation protocol that reliably reduced theta power shortly after stimulation onset. This manipulation preserved the place codes of individual cells but disrupted the fine temporal structure of endogenous spatio-temporal representations (for example, theta sequences) at the pairwise and population level. Theta disruption during locomotion was also sufficient to cause pronounced deficits in learning the more cognitively challenging component of a spatial alternation task, even though disruption was applied on only [~]66% of trials. Notably, network effects accompanying theta disruption were restricted to locomotor periods; we did not observe changes in replay rate, length, or content during immobility. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of the precise temporal microstructure of locomotion-associated spatial representations in the hippocampus for learning.",

      "content": "Truncating variants in SCN2A, which encodes the NaV1.2 sodium channel critical for action potential initiation and propagation, are associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy. To investigate SCN2A deficiency-related phenotypes, we developed a preclinical mouse model with under 50% NaV1.2 expression, exhibiting neuronal hyperexcitability and social deficits. However, the neuronal populations and molecular alterations underlying these phenotypes at single-cell resolution have not been investigated. In this study, we conducted single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of wild-type (WT), homozygous Scn2a-deficient (HOM) mice, and HOM mice with Scn2a restoration (HOM-FlpO) to examine the effects of Scn2a level on gene expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a critical brain region related to ASD development. Differential expression analysis in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons between genotypes revealed gene expression enriched in neurotransmitter activity regulation and synapse organization. Lastly, snRNA-seq results in HOM-FlpO identified genes that were rescued after Scn2a restoration. These results reveal that reduced Scn2a expression disrupts RNA transcriptomes in multiple neuronal subtypes, providing insight into cell type-specific mechanisms underlying SCN2A-related disorders.",

      "title": "Mapping prefrontal afferents along development",
      "content": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) acts as a hub for cognitive, emotional, and social processes, integrating neuronal inputs from numerous brain regions. Knowledge on the processes underlying formation and myelination of prefrontal afferents is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the emergence, maturation, and refinement of mPFC-dependent behaviors. However, despite detailed investigation of long-range projections to the mPFC in the adult brain, little is known about their maturation. Here, we use retrograde labeling, light-sheet imaging, and automatic cell segmentation to quantify afferent projections to the mPFC from neonatal to adult age. We show that densities of ipsi- and contralateral prefrontal afferents change along development from a widespread bilateral distribution at neonatal age to a precisely tuned, predominantly ipsilateral organization. Furthermore, myelination of interhemispheric prefrontal afferents starts only after the decline of neonatal contralateral projections. We identify specific patterns, e.g. elevated projection density from limbic brain regions during early adolescence, or decreasing projection densities from the mediodorsal thalamus decreasing towards adulthood. Overall, these distinct developmental dynamics of prefrontal afferents might have major implications for the maturation of mPFC-dependent functional and behavioral outputs.",

      "title": "Robustness through variability: ion channel isoform diversity safeguards neuronal excitability",
      "content": "Neural circuits are composed of different neuron types that exhibit distinctly different computational properties resulting from the sets of ion channels expressed. Profound insight exists into how neural computations arise from the precise regulation of ion channels (Armstrong et al., 1998; Lai, Jan, 2006; Nusser et al., 2012), how degenerate channel properties support similar computations (Marder, Prinz, 2002; Marder, Goaillard, 2006), and how channelopathies affect brain function (Kullmann, 2010). However, it remains elusive why neurons express many more channels, and isoforms thereof, than required to tune their specific excitabilities. Here, we employ an experiment-theory approach pairing electrophysiology with Drosophila genetics, and mathematical modelling to show that the variance in membrane properties that results from ion channel diversity promotes the robustness of neuron-type specific functions. Specifically, we show that the robustness of flight motoneuron coding properties to internal and external perturbations is significantly enhanced by the diversity of calcium channel splice isoforms expressed. Importantly, increased excitability robustness to perturbations of outward currents or temperature does not require adjustments in calcium channel mean properties. Instead, increases of the variance of calcium channel gating properties that result from channel isoform diversity broaden the dynamic input range the neuron can compute without reaching depolarization block. This broadens our concept of the functional consequences of the tremendous variety and diversity of ion channels expressed in brains.",

      "title": "A Pilot Study of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and the Right Teaching Parietal Junction",
      "content": "Theory of Mind (ToM) is conceptualized as the ability to infer the thoughts and feelings of others. Many studies have found that ToM abilities play a central role in collaborative communication between adults- with teachers performing more effectively when they have high levels of ToM. One of the main brain regions implicated in ToM is the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), which is thought to be responsible for evaluating belief formation processes. The current study had participants engage in a Lego model building task consisting of a director who instructed a builder on how to create duplicate models from a prototype that only the director could see. The rTPJ of the director was targeted for excitatory (10 Hz) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and inhibitory (1 Hz) TMS. There was a trend such that there was a decrease in the amount of time needed and an increase in accuracy between excitatory TMS and sham TMS (the control). The opposite pattern was observed between inhibitory TMS and sham TMS. These results suggest that teaching abilities are likely at least partially dependent on the rTPJ.",

      "title": "The microtubule nexus linking amyloid beta and tau: A simple and unifying theory for the underlying cause of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by cognitive decline in conjunction with accumulation of aggregated amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) and tau, yet existing models of AD fail to provide a simple connection between A{beta} and tau. However, microtubules provide an intriguing nexus for pathological interactions between the two. Tau binds to microtubules and is critical to maintain their proper function. We demonstrate that A{beta} also binds to microtubules with affinity comparable that of tau itself. We hypothesize that displacement of tau by A{beta} leads to microtubule dysfunction and facilitates tau phosphorylation and aggregation. Importantly, in this model, aggregation of A{beta} is not the primary cause of toxicity, which allows many of the apparent contradictions between A{beta} pathology and cognition to be rationalized. This new model highlights the importance of both tau and A{beta} and enables novel therapeutic and intervention strategies to be considered.",

      "title": "Reduced Dependence on Sensorimotor Processing in the Brain is Associated with Higher Math Skills in Adults",
      "content": "Number processing is crucial for math competence, yet the neural underpinnings remain unclear. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to 1) identify key brain regions involved in symbolic and embodied number processing, and 2) examine their relations with math abilities in children and adults. We collected fMRI data from 104 adults (Mage = 23.25 years) and 88 4th graders (Mage = 9.75) as they performed number comparison and phonological tasks with numeral (symbolic) and hand (embodied) numerical stimuli. Participants' math abilities were assessed using the math subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement. Univariate analyses revealed number processing regions in occipital, parietal and temporal cortices including inferior parietal, sensorimotor, supramarginal and insular areas. In adults, less involvement of sensorimotor processing regions during number compared to phonological processing is associated with enhanced math skills. These findings not only elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying number processing and math abilities but also raise questions about the emphasis on embodied number presentation in math learning experiences.",

      "title": "Distinct neural moderators of resilience and vulnerability confer heterogeneous outcomes following early-life adversity",
      "content": "Early-life adversity (ELA) increases risk for psychiatric disorders, but outcomes are highly variable. Using multimodal neuroimaging and computational moderation in large adolescent cohorts, we systematically identify brain features that buffer or amplify effects of three ELA subtypes - familial interpersonal, non-familial interpersonal, and non-interpersonal adversity - on transdiagnostic psychopathology. Multimodal neural moderators were subtype- and pathology dimension-specific, revealing distinct neurobiological mechanisms moderating heterogeneous outcomes. Protective features clustered in limbic, sensory integration, and regulatory circuits (amygdala, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate), while vulnerability features concentrated in frontotemporal circuits. Individual features and a new Relative Resilience Index (RRI) - reflecting the individual balance between protective and vulnerability features across the whole-brain - prospectively predicted psychopathological progression over two years, linking brain signatures to future mental health trajectories. Findings establish the brain as dynamic moderator of distinct adversity effects and introduce a system-level marker for risk stratification, advancing mechanistic precision in youth mental health and guiding early intervention.",

      "title": "The orbitofrontal cortex forms a context-generalized spatial schema that preserves topology and distance",
      "content": "Flexible and efficient navigation requires the brain to construct maps that are both topological, preserving the relationships between locations, and schematic, enabling generalization across environments. Although spatial maps in the hippocampus (HPC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) have been extensively studied, they remap almost orthogonally across environments even during identical behaviors, raising the question of how animals maintain consistent navigation strategies across spatial contexts. Here, we identify a novel spatial map in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that encodes navigational targets with distinct neural representations while preserving their topological order and relative distances by scaling to physical path lengths. Remarkably, OFC maps remained stable when animals performed the same navigation task across rooms and maze geometries, in stark contrast to the pronounced remapping observed in HPC and MEC. Moreover, OFC maps persisted after HPC or MEC lesions, demonstrating an independent spatial mapping system. These findings reveal a task-relevant topological schema in the OFC that uniquely supports flexible context-invariant navigation, expanding the spatial mapping repertoire of the brain beyond the hippocampal-entorhinal system.",

      "title": "Molecular Configuration, Regulation and Function of Heterochannel Electrical Synapses",
      "content": "Neuron-specific expression of particular gap junction channel components defines the configuration and functional properties of electrical synapses. However, how a neuron utilises multiple, simultaneously expressed channel proteins - connexins or innexins -to make meaningful connections with distinct synaptic partners remains largely unknown. Using the posterior mechanosensory circuit in C. elegans, we discovered that individual electrical synapses can be formed by clustering together molecularly distinct gap junction channel-types made of three different innexin proteins, INX-1, UNC-7, and UNC-9. In this previously unknown configuration, which we term as heterochannel synapses, molecularly distinct gap junction channel types functionally collaborate to regulate posterior touch sensory behaviour, enhancing functional robustness. We show that the synaptic trafficking of the different channel types within a heterochannel synapse is independently regulated by discrete and conserved kinesin motor proteins, while distinct molecular pathways involving channel-specific retrograde kinesins regulate their turnover. These independent, channel-specific regulations enable individual synapse-level alterations in the composition of heterochannel synapses under altered environmental conditions, providing a novel mechanism for electrical synapse plasticity. Finally, we present evidence of heterochannel electrical synapses in C. elegans locomotory circuits and in cerebellar Purkinje neurons of zebrafish larvae, suggesting that heterochannel organization may be a conserved feature of metazoan electrical synapses.",
