      "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Show HN: I open-sourced my Go and Next B2B SaaS Starter (deploy anywhere, MIT)",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I'm Mohammed, a technical founder who loves shipping and giving back to the community. I'm open-sourcing the full-stack engine that powers my B2B product, apflow.co.<p>What it is: A production B2B starter with a Go backend and Next.js frontend. Both are fully Dockerized with separate containers. No Vercel. No Supabase. Deploy the whole thing on a $6 VPS, or split frontend and backend across different providers. You own the infrastructure.<p>The problem I was solving:<p>Every SaaS starter I evaluated had the same issue: they locked me into someone else's platform. Vercel for hosting. PlanetScale for the database. Serverless functions billing per invocation. Fine for prototypes, but costs become unpredictable at scale and migrating away is painful.<p>I wanted something I could deploy on any Linux box with docker-compose up. Something where I could host the frontend on Cloudflare Pages and the backend on a Hetzner VPS if I wanted. No vendor-specific APIs buried in my code.<p>Why Go for the backend:<p>Go gives me exactly what I need for a SaaS backend:<p>Tiny footprint. The backend idles at ~50MB RAM. On a cheap VPS, that headroom lets me run more services without upgrading.\nConcurrency without complexity. Billing webhooks, file uploads, and AI calls run concurrently without callback hell.\nCompile-time type safety. Using SQLC, my SQL compiles to type-safe Go. If the query is wrong, it fails at build time, not in production.\nPredictable performance. No garbage collection pauses that surprise you under load.\nThe architecture (Modular Monolith):<p>I didn't want microservices complexity for a small team, but I needed clean separation. I built a Modular Monolith: features like Auth, Billing, and AI are isolated Go modules with explicit interfaces, but they deploy as a single binary.<p>This structure also made AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code) dramatically more effective. Because every module has strict boundaries, the AI knows exactly where new code belongs and doesn't break other modules.<p>Full-stack, not just backend:<p>Backend: Go 1.25 + Gin + SQLC (type-safe SQL, no ORM) + PostgreSQL with pgvector\nFrontend: Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind + shadcn/ui\nCommunication: The frontend consumes a clean REST API. You can swap Next.js for any framework that speaks HTTP.\nInfrastructure: Separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend. Deploy together or apart.\nWhat's pre-built:<p>The boring infrastructure is solved so you can focus on your actual product:<p>Auth + RBAC: Stytch B2B integration with Organizations, Teams, and Roles. Multi-tenant data isolation enforced at the query level.\nBilling: Polar.sh as Merchant of Record. Handles subscriptions, invoices, and global tax/VAT. No Stripe webhook edge cases.\nAI Pipeline: OpenAI RAG using pgvector. The retrieval service enforces strict context boundaries to minimize hallucinations.\nOCR: Mistral integration for document extraction.\nFile Storage: Cloudflare R2 integration.\nEach feature is a separate module. Don't need OCR? Remove it. Want Stripe instead of Polar? The billing interface is abstracted.<p>Real-world proof:<p>This isn't a template I made for GitHub stars. It's the exact code running apflow.co in production. When I added document OCR, I built it as a new module without touching Auth or Billing. The architecture held.<p>How to try it:<p>Clone the repo, read setup.md to check the prerequisite, run ./setup.sh, and you have a working B2B environment locally in minutes.<p>Feedback I want:<p>I'd appreciate feedback from Go developers on the module boundaries and cross-module interfaces. Also curious if anyone has suggestions for the Docker setup in production deployments.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/moasq/production-saas-starter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/moasq/production-saas-starter</a><p>Live: <a href=\"https://apflow.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://apflow.co</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46324665\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46324665</a></p>\n<p>Points: 19</p>\n<p># Comments: 13</p>",

      "title": "Mapping of critical prosodic and phonetic networks in post-stroke apraxia of speech",
      "content": "Purpose: Many have made proposals to better diagnose and/or classify post-stroke apraxia of speech (AOS), with some arguing for the separation of AOS into behavioral subtypes. Recent studies of primary progressive AOS have promoted a separation of prosodic and phonetic subtypes, aligning with a dual-motor coordination model separating the neural substrates of prosodic and phonetic function. Motivated by the limited corroboration of these subtypes in post-stroke AOS, here we present mapping results in a cohort of stroke survivors aiming to identify distinct neural substrates for prosodic and phonetic aspects of speech motor coordination. Methods: Left-hemisphere stroke survivors (n = 127; 64 with AOS) received speech-language evaluation and neuroimaging at the Center for the Study and Treatment of Aphasia Recovery (C-STAR). AOS severity was quantified via the Apraxia of Speech Rating Scale (ASRS). We utilized a novel lesion-symptom mapping technique with an emphasis on prediction that identifies ensembles of regions supporting performance in the prosodic and phonetic domains. Results: An ensemble of networks supporting prosodic function localized to dorsal and ventral (but primarily dorsal) sensorimotor cortex, as well as a distributed network of white matter pathways connecting Rolandic cortex to auditory regions and cerebellum, emphasizing the role of auditory feedback processing and laryngeal control in supporting prosodic function. A separate but partially overlapping network supporting phonetic function localized primarily to ventral Rolandic cortex and the arcuate fasciculus. Conclusions: This work represents the first mapping of prosodic and phonetic subtypes in post-stroke AOS in a large cohort of individuals. We hope our results motivate the development of assessment and treatment techniques individually targeting prosodic and phonetic functioning to better serve individuals with AOS and facilitate clinical discussion of the disorder.",

      "title": "Ectopic engraftment of nociceptive neurons derived from hPSCs for pain relief and joint homeostasis",
      "content": "Chronic pain arises from the interplay of inflammatory signals that activate and sensitize nociceptors within injured tissues. Most analgesics fail clinically due to their mono targeted mechanisms. Here, we apply human pluripotent stem cell derived nociceptive neurons (hPSC NNs) as therapeutic agents for osteoarthritis, targeting both pain and joint degeneration. We generated sensory neurons from hPSCs and identified CD200 as a nociceptor marker. Transcriptomic and functional profiling revealed that CD200high hPSC NNs closely resemble human nociceptors, expressing pain relevant receptors and ion channels. Strikingly, ectopic transplantation of CD200high hPSC NNs into the knee joint of osteoarthritic mice reduced pain and promoted bone and cartilage repair, whereas CD200low cells exhibited no benefit. Mechanistically, human and mouse proteomics suggest that CD200high hPSC NNs act as decoys by sequestering inflammatory ligands while secreting reparative factors in joint tissues. These findings uncover a fundamental role of nociceptors in tissue repair, providing a multi-targeted, disease modifying strategy for OA and chronic pain.",

      "title": "Prion shedding is reduced by chronic wasting disease vaccination",
      "content": "Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a strictly fatal and highly contagious prion disease of wild and farmed cervids currently expanding in North America. Prion diseases are caused by conversion of the cellular prion protein to its pathological isoform PrPSc. Vaccination is considered a promising strategy to contain CWD, even though prion diseases do not show classical immune responses. For CWD containment, it is important that vaccines reduce shedding of prions in excreta, a major contributor to transmission. Here, we tested the effect of vaccines on prion shedding in feces and urine by vaccinating and prion infecting knock-in mice that recapitulate CWD pathogenesis as found in cervids. Vaccination reduced or even prevented CWD shedding in feces and urine collected between 30-90% of incubation time to disease. This is the first report showing that prion shedding can be blocked in a prion disease. For CWD specifically it may reduce the environmental prion burden and break the disease transmission cycle.",

      "title": "Integrating brain structure and function for the neurobiology and genetics of language",
      "content": "Brain structure and function have largely been studied separately in relation to the neurobiology and genetics of language. Here we used linked independent component analysis to integrate language network functional connectivity with brain volumetric and white matter structure in 32,677 UK Biobank participants, followed by analysis of behavioural, neurobiological and genetic correlates of the derived multimodal structure-function imaging components. Stronger functional connectivity between brain language areas was associated with increased volume of parts of the cerebellum and motor cortex, together with smaller ventricles and sensory parietal and occipital areas. The brain structure-function language components mediated an association between vocabulary level and polygenic scores for reading ability. We report 18 genomic loci associated with brain structure-function language components. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability estimates for these components were 23-30%, and there was significant enrichment of heritability in primate-conserved genomic loci and fetal brain human-gained enhancer elements. This study revealed that structural correlates of functional language network connectivity extend well beyond previously defined language areas of the brain, and highlights the value of multimodal brain phenotyping for human neurogenetic discovery.",

      "title": "Inconsistent Subthalamic Beta Expression in the Local Field Potential amid In- and Anti-Phasic Neuronal Bursts.",
      "content": "Background: Elevated beta (12-32 Hz) activity in the local field potential (LFP) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and closely tied to synchronized spiking. Albeit the biomarker's prevalence has not been independently and reliably assessed, it is employed to guide deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implantation. Likewise, beta is under investigation to inform DBS programming and adaptive DBS. This study assesses the applicability of these efforts by quantifying the biomarker's prevalence and investigating its relationship to synchronized beta-bursting neurons. Methods: STN LFP and spiking activity of n = 156 patients with Parkinson's disease from six DBS centers recorded via microelectrodes was examined. Spectral peaks in the LFPs were classified and the absence of artifacts confirmed. The distribution of phase angles between beta LFP and spiking of individual beta-bursting neurons were explored. Findings: Bilateral beta LFP expression was observed in 47.25% of patients, and in 65.59% of hemispheres. LFP-synchronized neuronal spiking clustered in two-thirds of neurons at a primary and in one-third at a secondary LFP phase (182.84 degree phase shifted). This applied on the group level and for individual patients across different DBS centers. Interpretation: Beta-informed approaches mandate reliable biomarker expression, a requirement not met by slightly more than half of herein investigated patients. This is particularly troublesome for intraoperative guidance wherein the cause of biomarker absence, including DBS lead misplacement or a balanced ratio of phasic and antiphasic spiking neurons, cannot be determined, decreasing insight and increasing doubt. Although beta LFPs remain a valuable biomarker, routine clinical practice should not rely on beta alone; instead, multiple biomarkers (i.e. beta-gamma coupling, finely tuned gamma and/or cortico-cortical beta-band coupling) should be evaluated simultaneously to increase robustness.",

      "title": "LIVN: A testbed for learning to interact with in vitro neural networks",
      "content": "The investigation of cultured biological neural networks is a critical frontier in neuroscience with profound implications for the advancement of brain-machine interfaces, treatments of neurological diseases, and fundamental insights into neural computation and cognition. Advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology and machine learning are converging to enable novel approaches to interrogating neural circuits in vitro. However, progress in this emerging field is hampered by the technical challenges and resource-intensive nature of acquiring datasets suitable for machine learning. Experimental recordings typically do not allow for interactive learning and generally lack ground-truth information that would enable rigorous algorithm development and validation. To overcome the limitations of experimental setups, simulated biophysical models of neurons and neuronal networks can serve as crucial accelerators. They allow for more controlled and systematic exploration than currently possible with living cultures and serve as interpretable intermediaries between abstract computational theory and complex biological reality. Using this approach, we introduce livn: an open source interactive simulation environment for learning to control in vitro neural networks. livn generates synthetic neural data with ground truth at scale, enabling the development and testing of ML models in interactive settings that mimic experimental platforms. We describe benchmark tasks that challenge ML models to exploit simulated neural dynamics and release generated synthetic datasets that mimic in vitro systems. By providing an open, extensible platform for developing and benchmarking machine learning models, livn aims to accelerate progress in both ML-driven understanding and engineering of in vitro neural systems and fundamental understanding of computation in biological neural networks.",

      "content": "Homeotherms maintain a steady body temperature through thermoregulation, a process critical for survival during fasting, in which the brain has to defend energy-costly body temperature while reducing energy expenditure to conserve energy reserve; however, the neural basis for defending body temperature remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that AgRP neuron lesion led to lethality during time-restricted feeding but no obvious impact on HFD-induced obesity or obesity-reducing responses to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism. The lesion disrupted adaptive feeding behaviors during time-restricted feeding and reduced motivational feeding. Notably, the lethality was caused by hypothermia instead of reduced food intake. The lesion also caused failure in body temperature maintenance during acute fasting in cold. Fasting-induced activation in AgRP neurons was abrogated when mice were placed in a warm environment. Our results identify the physiological role for AgRP neurons in defending body temperature during restricted feeding but dispensable for body weight regulation with food ad libitum.",
