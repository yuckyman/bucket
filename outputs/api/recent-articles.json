      "title": "Motion sequencing reveals hidden patterns of repetitive behavior in a mouse model of epilepsy",
      "content": "Epilepsy is the 4th most prevalent neurological condition with 50 million cases worldwide. Patients with epilepsy bare a disproportionate burden of cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders which remain poorly understood and go underdressed by current anti-epileptic treatments. Furthermore, pre-clinical work on behavioral comorbidities can be hampered by current testing frameworks which rely on well-defined, discreet tests with limited repeatability. Recent work has demonstrated a role for machine learning modalities such as Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) in assessing behavioral differences between naive and epileptic. In this study we combined MoSeq with a novel analysis pipeline to uncover repetitive behaviors in chronically epileptic mice. These repetitive behaviors emerge alongside epilepsy specific racing behaviors which persist in epileptic mice as disease progresses. Finally, we show that epileptic mice have more fragile and dispersed behavioral networks. Together, these results lay a groundwork for extracting clinically relevant phenotypes from MoSeq data throughout disease progression.",

      "title": "Social isolation upregulates takeout expression in female Drosophila melanogaster to promote sucrose feeding",
      "content": "Drosophila melanogaster provides a model system to examine how environmental stress interacts with sex to induce changes in brain function and behavior. Previous research suggests that social isolation induces changes in gene expression that encode a starvation-like brain state and reduce sleep. However, the extent to which social isolation alters behaviors via sex-specific brain changes is unclear. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to explore sex differences in chronic social isolation-induced behavioral and transcriptomic changes. We focused on takeout (to), a gene encoding a putative juvenile hormone-binding protein, as a target that is upregulated solely in females following social isolation. Male and female adult flies were exposed to chronic social isolation, and multiple behavioral sex differences were identified through tests of activity, motivation, aggression, and sugar consumption. RNA-seq analysis also identified several candidate genes that were associated with sex differences in isolation-induced behavioral changes. Our findings suggest that social isolation is sufficiently stressful to reveal latent sex differences in behavior, despite having no impact on survival. To expression and sucrose consumption were upregulated exclusively in females following social isolation. Following to knockdown in to-expressing cells, sucrose consumption decreased in socially isolated females but increased in males. However, to knock down, to overexpression, and transformer knock down in neurons did not change sucrose-feeding behavior between control and isolated females. Overall, our results suggest that manipulating to expression influences sucrose-feeding in opposite directions between females and males following social isolation, and that isolation-induced to overexpression in non-neuronal cells in the brain or head may play a role in communicating information about females nutritional status to the brain. Additional roles for to in stress-related behaviors and behavioral sex differences should be explored, as well as whether to participates in signaling pathways that may be functionally conserved in human disorders.",

      "content": "A major goal within molecular systems neuroscience is to bridge the study of neuronal circuit function with changes in protein expression and localization in awake behaving animals. However, there are limited tools for capturing changes in subcellularly-defined proteomes within neuronal circuits during activity-gated timescales in vivo. Here, we engineered targeted versions of the proximity labeling enzyme TurboID, to tag proteins at the neuronal membrane during a user-delivered biotin injection. We optimized a labeling strategy that enables a one-to-two-hour labeling window and tagged proteins in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) cell bodies and corresponding axons in two downstream projections. We performed proteomics to identify proteins enriched in the distinct mPFC axonal projections, and discovered proteins enriched following an acute cocaine injection in mPFC cell bodies. These advancements enable the detection of proteins at the subcellular level within short labeling windows, allowing identification of stimulus-specific proteomes in behaving mice.",

      "title": "Shaft versus spine localization affects the structural plasticity of glutamatergic synapses",
      "content": "In the early stages of development, most excitatory synapses are formed directly on dendritic shafts. As neurons mature, these sites gradually shift from the shaft to dendritic spines. In fully developed excitatory neurons, the majority of glutamatergic postsynaptic sites containing the postsynaptic density (PSD) molecules reside on dendritic spines. However, some glutamatergic synapses remain as shaft synapses, yet their characteristics have remained unexplored. Here, we show that the molecular composition of the shaft PSDs closely resembles that of spine PSDs. Key components such as AMPARs, NMDARs, CaV1.2 channels, and F-actin interacting proteins, SynGAP, as well as cortactin, are present in comparable amounts in both synapse types. The major distinction between shaft and spine PSDs lies in the lower abundance of the scaffold proteins Shanks and Homer in shaft PSDs. Shaft synapses are not merely passive structures but actively participate in synaptic transmission. Their structure and function are modulated by changes in neuronal activity. Long-term live imaging combined with a cLTP protocol revealed that shaft PSDs were potentiated but rarely underwent a transition to spine synapses. In contrast, during LTD, shaft PSDs were eliminated more frequently than their spine counterparts. Together, these findings highlight excitatory shaft synapses as a distinct, and notably less stable, synapse type.",

      "title": "NKCC1 as a signaling hub regulating KCC2 stability, chloride homeostasis, and seizure susceptibility",
      "content": "Chloride homeostasis relies on the dynamic balance between the neuronal co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2. We reveal an unexpected mechanism by which NKCC1 governs KCC2 membrane stability. NKCC1 clusters recruits SPAK and PP1 to dynamically trap KCC2, compensating for its lack of a direct SPAK-binding site. Single-particle tracking shows that these NKCC1-rich assemblies operate as signaling hubs, enabling either SPAK-driven KCC2 phosphorylation and its membrane destabilization or PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of SPAK and KCC2 membrane stabilization. Peptides that activate SPAK by engaging NKCC1 PP1-binding motif lower KCC2 surface levels and reduce chloride extrusion, whereas a SPAK-inhibiting peptide prevents SPAK recruitment to NKCC1, stabilizes KCC2 in membrane clusters, and enhances chloride extrusion. An optimized peptide analog preserves KCC2 clustering under hyperexcitable conditions, reduces seizure frequency and severity in PTZ-induced epilepsy, and suppresses ictal activity in human epileptic tissue. These findings identify NKCC1-KCC2 coupling as a central regulatory axis for inhibitory signaling, and position our peptides as promising therapeutic candidates to restore chloride homeostasis in epilepsy and other disorders marked by impaired KCC2 membrane stability.",

      "title": "Selective Inactivation of Astrocytic Monoacylglycerol Lipase for Alzheimer Disease Therapy",
      "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, yet effective therapies remain lacking. Here, we identify monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the principal enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the brain, specifically in astrocytes as a promising therapeutic target for AD. APP transgenic (TG) mice with astrocyte-specific MAGL deletion (T-aKO), but not neuron-specific deletion (TG-nKO), exhibit markedly reduced A{beta} pathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, along with preserved synaptic structure and function and improved cognition. These benefits are recapitulated in TG mice by AAV-mediated silencing of astrocytic MAGL, whereas MAGL overexpression accelerates neuropathology and exacerbates synaptic and cognitive deficits. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that dysregulated synapse-, inflammation-, and AD-related gene expression profiles are reversed in TG-aKO mice. MAGL expression is elevated in astrocytes from both AD patients and TG mice. Remarkably, a single intracerebroventricular injection of AAV-MAGL-shRNA administered at either presymptomatic or postsymptomatic stages prevents or reverses neuropathology and synaptic and cognitive impairments in TG mice, providing preclinical evidence that astrocytic MAGL silencing represents an effective therapeutic strategy for AD.",

      "title": "Rhodopsin 7 is indispensable for regulating the firing rates of olfactory sensory neurons in response to extracellular field potential changes in Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "Although extracellular field potential changes are commonly observed in the nervous systems, it remains controversial if extracellular electrical activity contributes to neural processing or whether it is an epiphenomenon associated with neural activity. We previously reported that the extracellular field potential change in compound eyes in response to light stimulation induces firing rate changes in olfactory sensory neurons in female Drosophila melanogaster. Through further investigation, we found that the extracellular field potential within the olfactory sensillum is regulated by octopaminergic neurons in response to the light stimulation and that rhodopsin 7 mediates the firing rate changes in the olfactory sensory neurons in response to field potential changes in a light-independent manner. Structural analysis suggests a voltage-dependent gating mechanism for rhodopsin 7 to respond to the field potential change. This study reveals that the nervous system actively controls the field potential in response to sensory input, resulting in alteration of behavioral patterns as well as neural firing patterns in a context-dependent manner.",

      "title": "Early death and neuronal abnormalities in depdc5 loss-of-function mosaic zebrafish models",
      "content": "Abstract DEPDC5 (DEP domain-containing protein 5) encodes a repressor of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Variants in DEPDC5 are associated with a range of focal epilepsies, including mosaic variants associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and other focal brain malformations with brain-only somatic mosaic variants. To investigate the role of DEPDC5 in human epilepsy related to mosaic variants, we have generated mosaic depdc5 loss-of-function zebrafish models using homology-based constructs acutely targeting depdc5 and labeled with tdTomato to allow for visualization of the degree of mosaicism. The resulting mosaic depdc5 CRISPants demonstrated early larval death, with ~50% of CRISPants (vs. 10% of controls) dead by 7 days post fertilization (dpf), analogous to the early death sometimes associated with human DEPDC5-related epilepsy. We compared depdc5 CRISPants with uninjected and scrambled controls from the same clutches. Body and head size were reduced in the depdc5 CRISPants. Analysis of swimming behavior showed a striking reduction in distance traveled and maximum velocity in the depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Based on visual confirmation of mutational load, we categorized CRISPants into depdc5+ vs. depdc5++, reflecting weak vs. strong tdTomato fluorescence. We observed that depdc5++ CRISPants had increased episodes of posture loss, suggesting increased seizure-like behavior related to higher percentages of mutant cells. Local field potential recordings revealed increased neuronal hyperexcitability in depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Acridine orange staining demonstrated early apoptosis in the CRISPants vs. controls. Our mosaic depdc5 CRISPants provide a clinically relevant model to study the role of mosaic DEPDC5-related epilepsy and early death.",

      "content": "Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) confers the greatest genetic risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). With APOE4 broadly expressed in the brain, its cell-type-specific roles in AD pathogenesis are only beginning to be defined. Here, we show that neuronal APOE4 expression drives damaging lipid accumulation in hippocampal neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, with preferential buildup of peroxidized lipids in microglia in a tauopathy mouse model. Neuron-specific removal of APOE4 abolished this lipid phenotype, whereas neuron-specific expression of APOE4 was sufficient to recapitulate it, demonstrating that neuronal APOE4 is both necessary and sufficient for lipid accumulation. Strikingly, the association between lipid burden, microgliosis, and neurodegeneration was strongest in mice with neuron-specific APOE4 expression. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed neuronal APOE4-vulnerable neuron populations, as well as enrichment of disease-associated microglia and oligodendrocytes, all promoting lipid pathology. Primary mouse co-culture experiments showed that neuronal APOE4 drives microglial lipid accumulation via contact-dependent mechanisms involving uptake of lipids from neurons and oligodendrocytes. These findings establish neuronal APOE4 as a key driver of lipid accumulation via neuron-oligodendrocyte-microglia interactions, providing mechanistic insight into APOE4-driven lipid pathology in AD.",

      "content": "Sleep is a universal behavior that is critical for brain function and physiological homeostasis. While growing epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests reduced sleep quality is associated with negative health outcomes, the causal relationship between sleep loss and reduced longevity remains poorly understood. Here, we examine sleep across the lifespan and its relationship to longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. We examined the associations between numerous components of sleep at different life stages to longevity. Early life sleep, but not middle and late-life sleep, was positively associated with longevity. Age-dependent changes in sleep were consistent but accelerated, when flies are housed under stressful conditions including nutrient and temperature stress. Further, pharmacological restoration of sleep in the first 10 days of life, but not at later time points, increases longevity. Together, this work provides a systematic investigation of how different components of sleep impact longevity and suggests early life sleep may be particularly important in promoting sleep across the lifespan.",

      "title": "Show HN: Detail, a Bug Finder",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN, tl;dr we built a bug finder that's working really well, especially for app backends. Try it out and send us your thoughts!<p>Long story below.<p>--------------------------<p>We originally set out to work on technical debt. We had all seen codebases with a lot of debt, so we had personal grudges about the problem, and AI seemed to be making it a lot worse.<p>Tech debt also seemed like a great problem for AI because: 1) a small portion of the work is thinky and strategic, and then the bulk of the execution is pretty mechanical, and 2) when you're solving technical debt, you're usually trying to preserve existing behavior, just change the implementation. That means you can treat it as a closed-loop problem if you figure out good ways to detect unintended behavior changes due to a code change. And we know how to do that \u2013 that's what tests are for!<p>So we started with writing tests. Tests create the guardrails that make future code changes safer. Our thinking was: if we can test well enough, we can automate a lot of other tech debt work at very high quality.<p>We built an agent that could write thousands of new tests for a typical codebase, most \"merge-quality\". Some early users merged hundreds of PRs generated this way, but intuitively the tool always felt \"good but not great\". We used it sporadically ourselves, and it usually felt like a chore.<p>Around this point we realized: while we had set out to write good tests, we had built a system that, with a few tweaks, might be very good at finding bugs. When we tested it out on some friends' codebases, we discovered that almost every repo has tons of bugs lurking in it that we were able to flag. Serious bugs, interesting enough that people dropped what they were doing to fix them. Sitting right there in peoples codebases, already merged, running in prod.<p>We also found a lot of vulns, even in mature codebases, and sometimes even right after someone had gotten a pentest.<p>Under the hood:\n- We check out a codebase and figure out how to build it for local dev and exercise it with tests.\n- We take snapshots of the built local dev state. (We use Runloop for this and are big fans.)\n- We spin up hundreds of copies of the local dev environment to exercise the codebase in thousands of ways and flag behaviors that seem wrong.\n- We pick the most salient, scary examples and deliver them as linear tickets, github issues, or emails.<p>In practice, it's working pretty well. We've been able to find bugs in everything from compilers to trading platforms (even in rust code), but the sweet spot is app backends.<p>Our approach trades compute for quality. Our codebase scans take hours, far beyond what would be practical for a code review bot. But the result is that we can make more judicious use of engineers\u2019 attention, and we think that\u2019s going to be the most important variable.<p>Longer term, we think compute is cheap, engineer attention is expensive. Wielded properly, the newest models can execute complicated changes, even in large codebases. That means the limiting reagent in building software is human attention. It still takes time and focus for an engineer to ingest information, e.g. existing code, organizational context, and product requirements. These are all necessary before an engineer can articulate what they want in precise terms and do a competent job reviewing the resulting diff.<p>For now we're finding bugs, but the techniques we're developing extend to a lot of other background, semi-proactive work to improve codebases.<p>Try it out and tell us what you think. Free first scan, no credit card required: <a href=\"https://detail.dev/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://detail.dev/</a><p>We're also scanning on OSS repos, if you have any requests. The system is pretty high signal-to-noise, but we don't want to risk annoying maintainers by automatically opening issues, so if you request a scan for an OSS repo the results will go to you personally. <a href=\"https://detail.dev/oss\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://detail.dev/oss</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207852\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207852</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",
