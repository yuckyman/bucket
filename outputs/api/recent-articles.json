      "title": "Left-right asymmetry of the microminipig brain.",
      "content": "Left-right asymmetry of the brain is well recognized in various animals including C. elegans, drosophila and zebrafish. In primates, most of the brain studies describe side of the brain. However, in spite of huge amounts of accumulating rodent studies on neuroscience, most of rodent studies do not distinguish the brain side. The pig brain is considered to occupy an intermediate position between primates and rodents in terms of structural complexity and brain function. Moreover, the numbers of studies using genetic manipulation of pigs are drastically increasing. So, we investigated microminipig (MMP) brain mesoscopic anatomy focusing on left-right differences of its morphology. Here, we show anterior cingulate cortex, perirhinal cortex, and cerebellum of MMP, are structurally asymmetrical. Anterior cingulate gurus exhibited protrusion and invagination toward the midline on the right and left side, respectively. The left perirhinal cortex has extra gyrus which are not observed on the right side. The cerebellar vermis, paravermis is tilted from the midline and the consequently the cerebellar cortex exhibits asymmetrical morphology. These data demonstrate that MMPs are one of the suitable model animals for investigating cerebral and cerebellar asymmetry.",

      "title": "Noninvasive and Objective Near Real-Time Detection of Pain Changes in Fluctuating Pain",
      "content": "Chronic pain involves natural intensity fluctuations that patients cannot control, contributing to learned helplessness and functional impairment. Detecting spontaneous pain decreases could enable precisely timed interventions that enhance perceived control. However, existing research on objective pain assessment has focused primarily on estimating static intensity from short, predictable stimuli rather than detecting moment-to-moment changes in ongoing pain. This study investigated whether pain decreases can be detected objectively using easily obtainable physiological signals during fluctuating pain. We recorded multiple physiological signals (8-channel EEG, electrodermal activity, heart rate, pupil diameter, facial expressions) from 42 healthy participants (M_age = 26.2 years, SD = 5.1) during calibrated tonic heat pain stimulation on the left forearm with unpredictable intensity fluctuations (0-70 on visual analogue scale; twelve 3-minute trials). Temperature changes lasted 5-20 seconds. Using minimal preprocessing suitable for real-time applications, we trained state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify pain decreases versus non-decreases from brief temporal windows on a held-out test set (9 participants). Combining electrodermal activity, heart rate, and pupil diameter yielded optimal classification performance using a transformer-based architecture (AUROC = 0.854, accuracy = 76.8%). Electrodermal activity emerged as the most informative single predictor. Continuous stream analysis demonstrated median detection latency of 5.75 seconds with 70.4% sensitivity, reducible to 4.25 seconds at the cost of increased false positives. Results indicate that electrodermal activity and heart rate enable straightforward practical deployment, while highly variable signals such as EEG and facial expressions require personalized fine-tuned models. These findings establish a basis for closed-loop interventions targeting spontaneous pain changes.",

      "title": "Neurogranin enhances spontaneous activity and neuronal survival of hippocampal neurons",
      "content": "Neurogranin (Ng) is a postsynaptic protein highly enriched in forebrain neurons and implicated in synaptic plasticity through its ability to bind calmodulin. However, its impact on neuronal development, network dynamics, and cellular homeostasis remains incompletely understood. In this study, we examined the effects of manipulating Ng expression in primary hippocampal neurons using viral gene delivery, with emphasis on structural, functional, and molecular outcomes. Restoring Ng expression to adult physiological levels enhanced dendritic growth, increased synaptic number, and induced a proximal shift of the axon initial segment, consistent with adaptive responses to increased connectivity. Functionally, Ng markedly increased spontaneous neuronal activity and network synchronization, even under culture conditions that normally show minimal baseline activity. Electrophysiological recordings revealed enhanced burst firing and spike synchrony, indicating strengthened functional coupling rather than increased membrane excitability. Ng-dependent activity required action potential firing and glutamatergic transmission. At the molecular level, Ng increased total calmodulin levels in a binding-dependent manner, reduced overall calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II abundance while enhancing its relative autophosphorylation, and selectively decreased both total and surface levels of ionotropic glutamate receptors. These changes are consistent with a coordinated homeostatic reorganization of calcium-dependent signaling. Despite robust increases in activity, Ng expression improved neuronal viability, reduced cellular stress markers, and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Active caspase-3 was selectively elevated without triggering apoptosis, suggesting a non-apoptotic role in activity-dependent structural remodeling. Together, these findings identify Ng as a homeostatic regulator that promotes coordinated network activity, adaptive synaptic remodeling, and neuronal survival.",

      "title": "Attention-like regulation of theta sweeps in the brain's spatial navigation circuit",
      "content": "Spatial attention supports navigation by prioritizing information from selected locations. A candidate neural mechanism is provided by theta-paced sweeps in grid- and place-cell population activity, which sample nearby space in a left-right-alternating pattern coordinated by parasubicular direction signals. During exploration, this alternation promotes uniform spatial coverage, but whether sweeps can be flexibly tuned to locations of particular interest remains unclear. Using large-scale Neuropixels recordings in freely-behaving rats, we show that sweeps and direction signals are rapidly and dynamically modulated: they track moving targets during pursuit, precede orienting responses during immobility, and reverse during backward locomotion -- without prior spatial learning. Similar modulation occurs during REM sleep. Canonical head-direction signals remain head-aligned. These findings identify sweeps as a flexible, attention-like mechanism for selectively sampling allocentric cognitive maps.",

      "title": "Heterogeneity in neural network engagement supports individual differences in top-down attention",
      "content": "Top-down attention enables selective prioritisation of goal-relevant information, yet how attentional control varies across individuals remains unclear, particularly in relation to sensory processing. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry--in older adults performing a spatial cueing task--to examine both shared and subject-specific aspects of top-down attention. Informative spatial cues elicited sustained activity in fronto-parietal and sensory regions, alpha lateralisation, and increased pupil dilation, replicating established neural and physiological markers. Crucially, these group-level patterns were accompanied by systematic intersubject variability: individuals with greater hearing loss showed increased preparatory engagement of precentral and postcentral gyri, and variation in pupil dilation predicted activity in frontal regions. These results reveal that top-down attention arises from heterogeneous network configurations shaped by sensory processing and strategic resource allocation. Overall, our findings underscore the need to move beyond group averages to capture the neural architecture underlying individual differences in top-down attention.",

      "title": "Reduced Pupil-Linked Arousal Marks Implicit Memory for Complex Auditory Sequences",
      "content": "Observers rapidly form long-lasting implicit memories for recurring sensory patterns, supporting adaptive behaviour through learning of environmental contingencies. Here we tested how such memories interact with neuromodulatory systems that regulate arousal - whether implicit familiarity increases arousal through retrieval-related processes or instead decreases arousal via more efficient sensory processing. We examined these competing accounts using complex auditory tone-pip sequences in which a subset of patterns recurred approximately every three minutes. One group of participants (N=30) actively detected transitions from random to regular structure, whereas a second group (N=40) heard the same sequences while performing a decoy task. Consistent with prior work, recurring regular sequences elicited faster reaction times in the active group, confirming the formation of implicit memory. Subsequently, both groups listened to previously encountered regular patterns (REGr) and matched novel regular patterns (REGn) while pupil diameter was recorded. Across groups, REGr sequences evoked significantly smaller pupil dilations than REGn sequences, indicating attenuated arousal for familiar patterns. This reduction was sustained until sequence offset in the active group but was transient in the exposure group, suggesting that task demands during exposure shape the stability of pupil-linked memory expression. Importantly, the REGr-REGn pupil difference did not correlate with explicit post-session recognition, demonstrating that the effect was not driven by conscious awareness. Together, these findings identify pupil dynamics as a robust physiological marker of learned auditory structure and show that implicit auditory sequence memory attenuates arousal. The results support predictive processing accounts in which familiarity reduces uncertainty and, consequently, neuromodulatory drive.",

      "title": "Parental state dynamically reshapes auditory processing of offspring vocalizations in zebra finches",
      "content": "Parental care is critical for offspring survival. For many species, including humans, auditory cues unique to dependent offspring, such as baby cries, elicit the necessary behavior from parents to care for young. Despite this, we know little about how the brain encodes auditory cues specific to offspring. Zebra finches are an excellent model to study this. Zebra finches are biparental, meaning both male and female parents raise the young and rely on auditory cues (begging calls) to elicit chick feeding responses (parental behavior). Begging calls also become individually identifiable by the parents, necessitating higher-order learning/ association neural processes. It is well established that the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), a higher-order region of secondary pallial cortex (analogous to the mammalian secondary auditory cortex), is involved in the perception of complex auditory signals in birds. It is unknown, however, if/how NCM responds to offspring begging calls. To begin testing this, we used high density silicon probes to record single-unit in vivo electrophysiology activity in the NCM of adult parenting and non-parenting zebra finches exposed to playbacks of their own chicks begging calls (parents only), novel age-matched begging calls (parents and non-parents), as well as novel adult male song and pure tone controls. Our results show that NCM neurons in parents respond more strongly (i.e., higher evoked firing rates) to both their own and novel chick begging calls and have higher baseline (spontaneous) firing rates in narrow spiking units relative to non-parents. Furthermore, NCM neurons in parenting females tend to show more selective responses towards their own chick begging calls, whereas those in males do not show similar levels of selectivity. These studies lay essential groundwork for future studies on how auditory responses can elicit parental behavior and how these responses may change over the chick-rearing period.",
