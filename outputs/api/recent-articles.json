      "title": "Development and Kinematics Optimization of a Human-Compatible Rope-Driven Ankle Rehabilitation Robot Based on Foot-Ankle IFHA Identification",
      "content": "To address the mismatch between current ankle rehabilitation robots and natural human motion, which affects rehabilitation efficacy, this paper uses screw theory and motion capture experiments to identify the instantaneous finite helical motion axis (IFHA) of the human ankle joint. It determines the distribution law of the IFHA and twist pitch (TP) of the ankle, and designs a human-machine motion compatible rope-driven ankle joint rehabilitation robot that meets the needs of human ankle joint rehabilitation. Firstly, human ankle motion trajectories are captured using the VICON system and IMU, and the experimental data are processed according to screw theory to obtain the distribution law of the IFHA and the range of TP. Secondly, the ankle joint's motion characteristics from the experiment inform the constraint characteristics of the rehabilitation mechanism, which are then mapped into a novel parallel rope-driven ankle rehabilitation robot to meet rehabilitation needs. Thirdly, the kinematic model of the novel mechanism is established, and its kinematic performance and singular configurations are analyzed based on the motion/force transmission index, guiding the optimization of the driving rope layout and mechanism scale parameters. Finally, an experimental platform is built to validate the human-machine motion compatibility, safety, comfort, and effectiveness of the rehabilitation robot.",

      "title": "GONet: A Generalizable Deep Learning Model for Glaucoma Detection",
      "content": "Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON), affecting an estimated 64.3 million people globally, causes irreversible vision loss when not detected early. Traditional diagnosis requires time-consuming ophthalmic examinations by specialists. Recent deep learning models for automating GON detection from colour fundus photographs (CFP) have shown promise but often suffer from limited generalizability across different ethnicities, disease groups and examination settings. To address these limitations, we introduce GONet, a robust deep learning model developed using seven independent datasets, including over 119\u2009000 CFPs with gold-standard annotations and from patients of diverse geographic backgrounds. GONet consists of a DINOv2 pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer fine-tuned using a multisource domain strategy. GONet demonstrated high out-of-distribution generalizability, with an AUC of 0.88-0.99 in target domains. GONet performance was similar or superior to state-of-the-art works and the cup-to-disc ratio, by up to 18.4%. GONet is available via Lirot.ai (www.aimlab-technion.com/lirot-ai). We also contribute a new dataset consisting of 747 CFPs with GON labels as open access, available at https://doi.org/10.13026/pdxv-m215.",

      "title": "Phase Correction of MR Spectroscopic Imaging Data Using Model-Based Signal Estimation and Extrapolation",
      "content": "Objective: To develop an effective method for phase correction of magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. Methods: In many MRSI applications, it is desirable to generate absorption-mode spectra, which requires correction of phase errors in the measured MRSI data. Conventional phase correction methods are sensitive to measurement noise and baseline distortion, often resulting in distorted absorption-mode spectra from MRSI data with low-SNR and long acquisition dead time. This paper proposed a novel model-based method for improved phase correction of MRSI data. The proposed method determined the zeroth-order phase and acquisition dead time using a Lorentzian-based spectral model and performed signal extrapolation using a generalized series model. Absorption-mode spectra were then generated from the phase-corrected and extrapolated MRSI data. Results: The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated data and experimental data acquired from human subjects in multi-nuclei (31P, 2H, and 1H) MRSI experiments. Simulation results demonstrated improved parameter estimation accuracy by the proposed method under various noise levels and dead times. The proposed method also consistently generated high-quality absorption-mode spectra with minimal spectral distortions from experimental data. The proposed method was compared with state-of-the-art methods (including the entropy method and LCModel method) and showed more robust phase correction performance with less spectral distortions. Conclusion: This paper introduced a novel method for phase correction of MRSI data. Results from simulated and in vivo data demonstrated that high-quality absorption-mode spectra could be obtained using the proposed method. Significance: This method will provide a useful tool for processing MRSI data.",

      "title": "A cell-type-resolved human brain atlas of microRNAs and tRNA fragments",
      "content": "MicroRNAs (miRs) and transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) regulate multiple brain processes ranging from neurogenesis and development through diverse neurological disorders. However, the cell-type specificity of brain miRs and tRFs remains poorly characterized, limiting the interpretation of their function. To address this issue, we generated a comprehensive, cell-type-resolved atlas of miRs and tRFs from live human brain tissues. Specifically, we isolated neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes from neurosurgery-obtained fresh human brain samples and profiled their miR and tRF repertoires using small RNA-sequencing. Our atlas revealed multiple differences in miR and tRF expression between the four cell types and consequently identified novel cell-type markers. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR cell-type specificity may be regulated by quantitative trait loci located in cell-type-associated enhancer regions. We also report higher levels of 5'-tRNA halves in neurons compared to glia, including a particular neuronal enrichment of 5'-tRNA halves derived from glycine, leucine and lysine tRNAs. These neuronal tRFs were significantly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease postmortem brain samples compared to age-matched controls, possibly reflecting a neuronal response to disease. Our atlas, together with an accompanying statistical tool for miR cell-type enrichment analysis, provides a publicly available resource for delineating small RNA cell-type origin and function in the human brain.",

      "title": "Understanding Brain Aging Through Behavioural and Microglial Changes: A Lifespan Approach",
      "content": "Aging is characterized by progressive physiological decline linked to inflammaging, a chronic low-grade inflammatory state. This study investigates age-related behavioural changes and their correlation with microglial function in female Sprague Dawley rats across their lifespan. Using a longitudinal design at 2, 6, 12, and 24 months of age, we assessed motor performance, mood-related behaviours, and spatial cognition alongside microglial morphometric analysis in key brain regions. Results showed that motor and cognitive performance began to decline significantly at 12 months, with severe impairments and depressive-like behaviours appearing by 24 months. These deficits were paralleled by progressive gliosis in the hippocampus and striatum. Microglial morphometric analysis further indicated a more reactive, region-dependent phenotype, with cells in the striatum adopting a smaller area, reduced perimeter, and fewer intersections. These findings provide compelling evidence for significant age-dependent deterioration in motor performance, mood regulation, and cognitive abilities in female rats. Our data strongly suggest an underlying progression of neurobiological changes, with microglial dysfunction and neuroinflammation being central candidates. This research contributes valuable insights into the cellular correlates of behavioural decline across the female lifespan, serving as a reference for the multifaceted changes that occur during normal aging.",

      "content": "Neural circuits in the brain control high-level parameters of movement, including the initiation, speed, and direction of locomotion. How specific cell types are organized into circuits to compute these control signals and enable context-appropriate behavior remains unclear. Here, we identify central brain neurons in Drosophila that can initiate walking and exert graded control over walking speed. Connectome analyses position the neurons on top of a layered brain circuit, which recruits a specific population of descending neurons to control forward walking independently of turning and other parameters. As predicted by the connectome, the circuit enforces straight walking when activated unilaterally, and the activity of the central brain neurons represents a high-level walking drive. This drive is suppressed during flight but flexibly integrated with other control signals to enable complex movement sequences during obstacle negotiation. Together, our findings elucidate a dedicated brain circuit that enables efficient computation, selection, and integration of forward-walking signals for context-appropriate motor control.",

      "title": "Dopaminergic Modulation of Mushroom Body Output Neurons Mediates Nociception-Induced Escape in Drosophila",
      "content": "In Drosophila, noxious heat is detected by peripheral nociceptors expressing transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, including Painless and TrpA1, and rapidly triggers escape behavior. Although peripheral transduction has been defined in detail, the central circuits and neuromodulatory mechanisms that translate nociceptor activity into escape decisions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine targeted behavioral perturbations with anatomical tracing to delineate a nociception to escape pathway that engages dopaminergic modulation of mushroom body (MB) output. Kir2.1 mediated silencing across candidate neurotransmitter systems revealed a specific requirement for MB innervating dopaminergic neurons (DANs), particularly subsets within the PPL1 and PAM clusters, for robust nociception induced escape. Anterograde trans Tango tracing from painless and trpA1 expressing nociceptors labeled these MB dopaminergic neurons as direct postsynaptic partners, consistent with convergence of distinct nociceptor inputs onto a shared dopaminergic pathway. Finally, silencing a subset of mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) delayed escape without overtly disrupting baseline locomotion, supporting a model in which dopaminergic signaling recruits MB output to shape defensive action selection. Together, our results define a multi layer circuit motif linking peripheral nociception to MB dependent escape and provide a framework for dissecting how neuromodulation gates rapid defensive behaviors.",

      "content": "Objective: To design and fabricate a band-pass birdcage volume resonator and eight channel, conformal receive array coil for MRI of both awake and anesthetized marmoset brain at 7T. The coil is compatible with a whole body 7T clinical MRI scanner running in single channel transmit (sTx) mode. Methods: The marmoset head coil included a shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil with 24 legs, as well as 8 overlapped receive elements. Electromagnetic (EM) field simulation was performed for the 24 leg band pass birdcage Tx coil to calculate the B1+ efficiency. The efficacy of both transmit and receive coil designs were evaluated by measuring standard coil performance metrics. This was done while imaging a marmoset head phantom, as well as by acquiring in vivo, anesthetized and awake marmoset images. Results: The transmit coil along with the optimized receive array produced high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic for EPI images; 0.36 mm isotropic for structural images) and high SNR (between 50 and 80) images of the marmoset brain. The simulated B1+ efficiency of the birdcage at the center of the phantom was 2.6 \u00b5T/sqrt (W). Conclusion and significance: A shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil was designed and fabricated for marmoset brain imaging at 7T. An 8-channel receive array consisting of eight overlapped loops, covering the whole brain of the marmoset, was also constructed and applied for signal reception. The system successfully allowed scanning of both young and older marmosets. It is well-suited for longitudinal studies of marmoset brain structure. The coil advantageously allows the study of neurodevelopment and primate brain function.",

      "content": "Objective: To develop a transceiver radio frequency (RF) coil optimized for high resolution small-animal imaging at 14.1 T, aimed at enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Methods: A hybrid distributed capacitance (HDC) birdcage coil was designed, combining conventional endring lumped capacitors with distributed capacitance along the legs, implemented using double-layer copper-clad substrates. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations were employed to optimize the coil's structural parameters and capacitance values for maximum RF performance. The HDC birdcage coil's performance was evaluated against a conventional bandpass (BP) design through electromagnetic simulations, bench tests, and phantom imaging. In vivo validation was performed using mouse imaging. Results: EM simulations demonstrated that the HDC design enhances mean $\\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ and $\\text{B}_{1}^{-}$ field strengths by 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, relative to the conventional BP design. The HDC design also showed reduced electric field (E-field) value in phantom, with 4.2% lower mean and 11.4% lower maximum E-field value. Bench measurements revealed a superior quality factor (Q factor) for the HDC coil, with a 34.2% higher unloaded Q value compared to the conventional design. Phantom imaging confirmed a 41% SNR improvement with the HDC design. The optimized HDC coil enabled mouse brain imaging at 50 $ \\!\\!\\mu \\!\\!\\text{ m}$ resolution.Conclusion: The proposed HDC birdcage coil demonstrated superior receiver sensitivity and Q factor compared to conventional designs, yielding significant SNR improvements in 14.1 T imaging. Significance: The results demonstrated the feasibility of achieving enhanced coil performance through HDC design at ultra-high field strength, providing a promising approach for improving image quality in small-animal MRI applications.",

      "title": "Neural markers of visual working memory during an upper extremity movement-coupled task: a mobile brain-body imaging (MOBI) study.",
      "content": "Optimal goal directed behavior in everyday life involves the appropriate coupling of cognition and movement. In this study we employed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) system that integrated time-synchronized high-density electroencephalography with three-dimensional motion capture during a touchscreen visual working memory task requiring dynamic upper extremity reach responses. Using this framework we examined how increasing memory load (e.g. from 1-disc to 4-discs) influences behavior and scalp-recorded neural activity when cognitive and motor processes are coupled within a single task, and whether these effects are modulated by handedness. Increasing memory load reliably degraded working memory task performance and slowed motor preparation while core movement execution measures remained largely preserved. Regarding electroencephalography data, parieto-occipital activity increased with load during both the early visual-evoked N1 and the delay period However, load-related modulation reached a plateau at the 3-disc condition during the delay period only. Posterior-frontal engagement also strengthened as load increased, consistent with demands on attentional control memory maintenance and sensorimotor planning. Brain-behavior associations were most robust at a moderate 2-disc level where contralateral delay activity correlated with both cognitive and motor performance measures. Finally, although handedness exerted selective behavioral effects it did not modulate load-related parieto-occipital neural activity Together these findings demonstrate that a multimodal MoBI approach captures integrated cognitive-motor dynamics during working memory guided actions, providing a more comprehensive characterization of behavior and underlying neural signatures than either modality alone This framework offers a translational approach for studying cognitive-motor interactions and their potential disruption in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",
