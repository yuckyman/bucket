      "title": "Hierarchical organization of mechano-nociceptive pathways revealed by activity labeling",
      "content": "Noxious mechanical stimuli give rise to distinct percepts, from sharp cutaneous pain to diffuse visceral discomfort, yet the nociceptor ensembles that underlie these differences remain poorly defined. We mapped the peripheral architecture of nociceptive signaling by combining in vivo activity labeling of pelvic nerve afferents with single-cell RNA sequencing. Noxious stimuli recruited diverse classes of mechano-nociceptors, but stimulus type exerted modest influence on the composition of activated ensembles. Instead, tissue identity imposed the dominant organizational structure: stimulation of cutaneous and deep pelvic tissues engaged distinct subsets of both myelinated and unmyelinated neurons, revealing a clear domain-level division. Within this architecture, we identified a bladder-innervating myelinated nociceptor subtype with distinctive molecular features, illustrating an additional layer of refinement. Functional imaging and anatomical tracing corroborated this multilevel organization. These findings reveal a hierarchical organization of peripheral mechanical pain encoding, in which mechano-nociceptor populations are differentially engaged according to tissue domain and organ context.",

      "title": "Involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex in food addiction: new insights from in vivo calcium Imaging",
      "content": "Food addiction is a multifactorial disorder characterized by a loss of control over food intake, contributing to the development of obesity. To investigate the involvement of the prelimbic (PL) medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the transition to food addiction, we examined PL calcium dynamics in mice exhibiting addicted versus non-addicted behavioral phenotypes. Our behavioral results allowed the identification of two distinct subpopulations of addicted and non-addicted mice, enabling direct comparison of their neural activity profiles. Addicted and non-addicted mice showed significant differences across several PL calcium activity parameters. These findings demonstrate a strong association between PL mPFC calcium activity dynamics and key addiction criteria, highlighting a critical role of this brain region in the development of food addiction. Understanding these neurobiological differences enhances our insight into brain mechanisms underlying loss of eating control and may inform more targeted approaches for studying and ultimately treating food addiction.",

      "content": "Visuospatial neglect (VSN) after right-hemisphere stroke causes reduced engagement with left-sided stimuli, but how VSN affects automatic processes, i.e. the registration of regularities and regularity violations is still equivocal. This study investigated these processes using event-related potential components C1, C2/N1, and the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), and how they differ in VSN compared to stroke and healthy controls, and their changes with time and rehabilitation. We applied a passive oddball paradigm, where diamond patterns periodically disappeared (OFF events) and reappeared (ON events) on the lower left and right sides, creating two simultaneous but independent sequences with standard and deviant events. The study included a VSN group (N=17, M=53.88{+/-}0.28 yrs); stroke patients (N=16, M = 56.81{+/-}13.26 yrs); and healthy participants (N=17, M=53.89{+/-}10.79 yrs). The VSN group underwent measurements three times: pre- and post-rehabilitation, and at a 4-month follow-up. Our results show that the C1 component emerged reliably in healthy participants and as a tendency in stroke controls, but not in VSN at any measurement point. The C2/N1 component emerged for all events without group differences. VSN patients showed no reliable vMMN, while it emerged in stroke patients for left-sided OFF events. Healthy controls showed vMMN in every condition. Our results suggest that both stroke and VSN impair the automatic detection of regularity violations, but VSN does so in a more substantial way, and this deficit does not improve with time or rehabilitation. Furthermore, the missing C1 component in VSN may indicate an early-stage deficiency even in visual processing.",

      "title": "Spatial auditory change detection in listeners with hearing loss",
      "content": "Everyday listening relies on the auditory system's ability to automatically monitor the background soundscape and detect new or changing sources. Although change detection is a fundamental aspect of situational awareness, little is known about how hearing impairment affects this ability. This study examined how sensorineural hearing loss influences spatial auditory change detection. Older hearing-impaired listeners (N = 30) completed a spatial change detection task requiring them to identify the appearance of a new sound source within a complex spatialised acoustic scene. Hearing loss was characterised by three factors that were measured with standard clinical tests: audiometric hearing thresholds, sensitivity to small level changes, and sensitivity to spectrotemporal modulation. Simple and mixed-effects linear models were used to test how these factors predicted reaction time, hit rate, and false alarm rate. Listeners with poorer spectrotemporal sensitivity, higher audiometric hearing thresholds, and older age showed slower and less accurate detection, whereas sensitivity to small changes in level did not predict outcomes. Detection also varied with spatial location, where appearing sources from behind were detected more slowly and less accurately than those from the front or sides. Numerical analysis using head-related transfer functions confirmed that these rear-field effects were unlikely to be explained by overall or frequency-specific acoustic level differences. These findings reveal that hearing loss, age, and spatial factors jointly shape listeners' ability to monitor dynamic auditory scenes. Additionally, testing spectrotemporal sensitivity offers a promising clinical measure of non-speech auditory processing with relevance for hearing-aid fitting and situational awareness.",

      "content": "Voltage imaging demands technical innovations to realize its full potential in neuroscience. Although two-photon microscopy is widely used in brain research, its imaging speed is insufficient for high-throughput voltage recordings. To overcome this limitation, we developed an all-optical beam multiplexing engine via retroreflection from two near-parallel mirrors. This approach integrates seamlessly with standard two-photon microscopes, enabling kilohertz-frame-rate imaging across a 16-fold expanded field of view while maintaining synaptic resolution. Operating at over 220 megapixels per second, it enables submillisecond imaging of dendritic propagation of action potentials and simultaneous voltage recording from more than 200 hippocampal neurons in head-fixed, behaving mice. This advancement unlocks new possibilities for large-scale, high-speed functional studies in neuroscience.",

      "title": "Reduction of A\u03b225-35-Induced Cognitive Impairments in C57BL/6 Mice Through Focused Ultrasound Thermal-Cycling Stimulation",
      "content": "Hyperthermia (HT) is recognized across various medical disciplines for its capacity to modulate specific protein expressions. In efforts to improve Alzheimer's disease (AD), HT has the potential to regulate heat shock proteins (HSPs) and antioxidant enzymes, which helps decrease the aberrant accumulation of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) protein and oxidative stress. Nonetheless, the precise delivery of mild hyperthermia to the brain remains a significant challenge. To apply mild hyperthermia targeted to the brain and evaluate its impact on cognitive improvement, this study used focused ultrasound (FUS) to administer localized mild hyperthermia to the brains of AD mouse induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{beta}25-35. For considerations of safety and therapeutic efficacy, a thermal-cycling hyperthermia (TC-HT) protocol was adapted into a focused ultrasound thermal-cycling stimulation (FUS-TCS), which was compared with the continuous focused ultrasound hyperthermia stimulation (FUS-HTS). The findings revealed that the FUS-TCS treatment group exhibited a significant improvement in cognitive performance, as evidenced by enhanced outcomes in the Y-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Furthermore, this group demonstrated increased expression of A{beta}-degrading enzymes and antioxidant proteins, including heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). These results suggest that localized mild hyperthermia targeting the brain using FUS-TCS treatment represents a promising strategy for ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with AD.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",
