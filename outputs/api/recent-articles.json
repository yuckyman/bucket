      "title": "Whole-brain clearing reveals region- and cell type-specific imbalances in inhibitory neurons in a mouse model for Kleefstra Syndrome",
      "content": "GABAergic inhibition is essential for balanced brain function and is frequently disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The inhibition is generated by a diverse population of GABAergic interneurons, which differ in subtype composition and spatial density across the brain. Here, we applied an unbiased whole-brain clearing and light-sheet imaging approach to systematically map the distribution of the three major GABAergic interneuron subtypes - Parvalbumin-positive (PV+), Somatostatin-positive (SST+), and Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide-positive (VIP+) cells - across the mouse brain in a model of Kleefstra Syndrome (Ehmt1+/-), a monogenic intellectual disability disorder with a strong ASD component. Analyzing 895 brain regions we identified widespread, cell type- and region-specific alterations in GABAergic populations. Notably, we observed increased VIP+ neuron density in the Ehmt1+/- cortex and decreased SST+ neuron density in sensory cortical and subcortical regions. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), PV+ interneurons exhibited precocious maturation already at the juvenile stage, which persisted into adulthood and was associated with enhanced inhibitory input onto BLA principal neurons. We here demonstrate that Ehmt1 haploinsufficiency results in region- and cell-type specific changes throughout the brain. These results underscore the value of whole-brain, high-resolution mapping approaches in uncovering previously unrecognized patterns of neural vulnerability in neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Developmental Connectomics of the Mouse Cerebellum",
      "content": "To uncover the developmental processes that establish the precise patterns of synaptic connectivity in the CNS, we employed a connectomic approach in the mouse cerebellar cortex between birth and 2 weeks of age. There were dramatic quantitative and qualitative changes in the structure and connectivity of cerebellar cells. Parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje cells increased ~500-fold, with the most rapid growth taking place a week after birth. To support this profound synaptogenesis, Purkinje cells generated thousands of transient parallel fiber-oriented filopodia that received nascent synapses from parallel fibers. Importantly, we find that granule cells initiate synaptic output onto Purkinje cells only after receiving mossy fiber input, revealing a sequential, input-dependent logic for circuit assembly. In sharp contrast to the concurrent pruning of climbing fiber inputs, parallel fiber connectivity expanded and became highly individualized during development. Despite anatomical overlap, neighboring Purkinje cells share significantly fewer parallel fiber inputs than expected by chance. Moreover, parallel fibers themselves diverged spatially, further enforcing selective input allocation and resulting in highly specific parallel fiber cohorts for each Purkinje cell. Our findings uncover a mechanistic sequence in which early afferent activity and transient cellular structures guide the selective wiring and expansion of parallel fiber input to Purkinje cells, establishing developmental principles that ensure functional specificity in the mature brain.",

      "title": "Temporal basis function models for closed-loop neural stimulation",
      "content": "Objective. Closed-loop neural stimulation provides novel therapies for neurological diseases such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but it is not yet clear whether artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can tailor closed-loop stimulation to individual patients or identify new therapies. Further advancements are required to address a number of difficulties with translating AI to this domain, including sample efficiency, training time, and minimizing loop latency such that stimulation may be shaped in response to changing brain activity. Approach. We propose temporal basis function models (TBFMs) to address these difficulties, and explore this approach in the context of excitatory optogenetic stimulation. We demonstrate the ability of TBF models to provide a single-trial, spatiotemporal forward prediction of the effect of optogenetic stimulation on local field potentials measured in two non-human primates. The simplicity of TBF models allow them to be sample efficient ( \u2009min of training data), rapid to train ( \u2009min), and low latency ( \u2009ms) on desktop CPUs. Main results. We demonstrate the model on 40 sessions of previously published excitatory optogenetic stimulation data. Surprisingly, on test sets it achieved a prediction accuracy 44% higher than a complex nonlinear dynamical systems model that requires hours to train, and 158% higher than a linear state-space model requiring 90\u2009min to train. Additionally, in two simulations we show that it successfully allows a closed-loop stimulator to drive neural trajectories, and to achieve the user-preferred trade-offs between under- and over-stimulation, given the uncertainty in the model; it achieves an area under curve of \u223c0.7 in both cases. Significance. By optimizing for sample efficiency, training time, and latency, our approach begins to bridge the gap between complex AI-based approaches to modeling dynamical systems and the vision of using such forward prediction models to develop novel, clinically useful closed-loop stimulation protocols.",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "Exogenous attention is a rapid, involuntary mechanism that automatically reallocates processing resources toward salient stimuli. It enhances visual sensitivity in the vicinity of the salient stimulus, both in extrafoveal regions and within the high-acuity foveola. While the spatial frequencies modulated by exogenous attention in extrafoveal vision are well characterized, it remains unknown how this mechanism operates within the foveola, which can resolve spatial frequencies up to 30 cycles per...",

Due to the rarity of these cases, there is no consensus on acute management. We present a case of a woman in her seventies who presented with right eye pain and blurred vision due to spontaneous hyphema secondary to active bleeding from a vascular tuft. Conservative measures, including mydriatics and compression, failed to control...",
