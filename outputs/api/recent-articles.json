      "title": "Spacetime concordance in the primate cortex",
      "content": "The expanding scale and complexity of functional brain image datasets require space-time analytics. Spacetime concordance (STC) meets this need through an adaptive and robust framework optimized for high-speed analysis. At the core of STC, the Regional Functional Affinity (RFA) metric quantifies functional diversity and uniformity in primate connectomes using wakeful fMRI. This data-driven optimization achieves considerably faster processing, becoming broadly relevant to comparative neuroscience applications. We validated this approach using large-scale datasets from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 1,003) and the NIH Marmoset Brain Mapping Project (N = 26). Results demonstrate striking correspondence between parcellation boundaries of HCP atlas and functional heterogeneity, with boundary lines consistently aligning with regions of low RFA values. In humans, higher-order association networks exhibited lower RFA values indicating functional diversity, while primary sensorimotor networks displayed higher RFA values reflecting uniformity. Cross-species analysis revealed evolutionary conservation of this organizational principle alongside species-specific adaptations. The RFA metric successfully bridges discrete parcellation schemes and continuous models of brain function, offering new insights into primate brain organization and evolution.",

      "title": "Beyond the straight path: high-density laminar recordings in the ventral hippocampus with curved microprobes",
      "content": "Brain function is governed by neural circuits distributed across an intricate, three-dimensional landscape of anatomically complex structures. Current methods for monitoring neural activity are limited to investigating structures that lie along a single, linear trajectory. While this approach is effective for columnar regions, such as dorsal cortical areas or the relatively planar dorsal hippocampus, it fails in deep or curved structures, like the ventral hippocampus, where a linear probe can only achieve with difficulty the combination of physical access and perpendicular orientation required for recordings across all layers. To overcome this limitation, we developed a multisite microelectrode array with a pre-formed curved geometry, engineered to align perpendicularly with neuronal layers in deep anatomical targets regardless of their orientation. This interface integrates a polymer-based array, featuring 16 PEDOT:BF4-coated microelectrodes for robust signal acquisition, with a dissolvable silk stiffener for precise surgical insertion. The resulting device exhibited excellent electrical properties (avg. impedance 18 k{Omega}) and enabled accurate placement across the distinct neuronal layers of the ventral hippocampus CA1 region. These capabilities allowed for successful recordings of both local field potentials and single-unit activity from this region, providing a powerful new tool to investigate the network dynamics of previously inaccessible neural circuits.",

      "title": "Flexible gaze reinstatement during working memory for natural scenes",
      "content": "Working memory (WM) representations may be more action-oriented and anatomically widespread than previously assumed. For instance, oculomotor signatures like gaze biases can reflect spatial WM content. However, the specificity and functional relevance of such signatures is unclear. Here, we tracked eye gaze during WM for naturalistic images, and manipulated which image features were most task-relevant (visual or semantic). In two experiments, we found that the eyes carried out item-specific spatiotemporal gaze sequences during WM maintenance, retracing the scanpath from stimulus encoding. Therefore, gaze patterns during WM track the identity of complex, natural images held in mind. Moreover, the degree of such WM gaze reinstatement was stronger when the task prioritized visual detail, and ramped up in anticipation of the test probe. Oculomotor WM signals are therefore malleable to when and how the content will be used, indicating that distributed WM representations are prospectively-oriented and functionally flexible to situational needs.",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "Lanthanide (Ln^(3+))-doped lead-free inorganic metal halide perovskites with near-infrared (NIR) luminescence have shown great promise in optoelectronics. However, these materials exhibit low NIR efficiency due to insufficient absorption from forbidden f - f transitions. Herein, a strategy based on Mo^(4+)-Er^(3+) co-doping is reported to achieve efficient NIR emission in Cs(2)ZrCl(6) phosphors, which are excitable by low-cost multicolor light-emitting diode (LED) chips.
