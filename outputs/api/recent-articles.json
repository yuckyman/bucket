      "title": "Sensory Circuit Dynamics in a Mouse Model of Epileptic Encephalopathy",
      "content": "Epileptic encephalopathies (EEs) are severe developmental disorders with abnormal EEG activity that worsens neurodevelopmental deficits, yet underlying sensory and cognitive impairment mechanisms are unclear. We studied cortical circuit dynamics in Ank3-1b mutant mice, an EE model with parvalbumin interneuron dysfunction, using laminar electrophysiology, spike-field coherence (SFC), single-unit analyses, and behavioral assays. Ank3-1b mutant mice showed disrupted excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, with reduced sink/source ratios (p = 0.0279) and elevated net currents (AVREC; p < 0.01), indicating hyperexcitability. In awake states, sensory-evoked intra-columnar connectivity was impaired, with lower Pearson correlations (p < 0.001) and increased low-frequency (3-30 Hz) SFC (p < 0.001), but intact gamma-band coherence, suggesting aberrant synchronization. Inhibitory neuron latencies were delayed in infragranular layers under anesthesia (p < 0.001) and supragranular layers when awake (p = 0.005), implying thalamocortical deficits. Despite preserved sensory adaptation and recognition memory, Ank3-1b mutant mice exhibited heightened anxiety (p < 0.05) and variable circadian rhythms, indicating selective affective and regulatory deficits. These results show that Ank3-1b loss disrupts cortical E/I balance and synchrony, delaying sensory processing, while compensatory mechanisms maintain critical sensory functions. This study links ANK3 mutations to layer-specific circuit dysfunction, offering insights into EE pathophysiology and sensory deficits.",

      "title": "Vascular dementia increases levels of methylenetetrahydro-folate reductase and cystathionine \u03b2-synthase in female patients and changes gene expression of acetylcholine and glutamate clathrin-sculpted transport vesicles",
      "content": "Deficiencies in one-carbon (1C) metabolism are linked to the onset of vascular dementia (VaD). Our previous work using mouse models has demonstrated that reduced dietary intake of folic acid or genetic deficiencies in 1C metabolism result in worse outcomes using a model of VaD. This study aims to provide a detailed molecular portrait of 1C metabolism within the context of VaD, shedding light on potential molecular mechanisms. In cortical post-mortem tissue from female and male VaD patients and controls we measured the folate receptor (FR) and 1C enzymes including methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), cystathionine {beta}-synthase (CBS), with NeuN and DAPI as markers. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics was performed on 4 samples. VaD and gender impacted levels of FR. Both male and female VaD had increased levels of ChAT. Female VaD patients had higher levels of MTHFR and CBS when compared to males. Spatial transcriptomics revealed reduced expression of the glutamate and acetylcholine clathrin-sculpted transport vesicles and increase in glutamatergic neurons. VaD is a complex disease; the results of this study demonstrate that VaD impacts levels of 1C, as well as gene expression. Dietary sup-plementation with 1C may be beneficial for affected patients.",

      "title": "Temporal Dynamics of Complement Activation and Outcome in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke",
      "content": "Immune-mediated inflammatory responses exacerbate brain injury and affect the prognosis in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We characterized longitudinal complement activation after AIS using serial plasma samples from 10 patients and 8 controls. Initial markers of classical (C1q), lectin (mannose-binding lectin [MBL]), and alternative (Factor Bb [CFBb]) pathways, as well as regulatory (Factor H [CFH]) and downstream markers (C3a, C5a and C5b-9) were measured by ELISA at 9 time points. Stroke patients showed broad complement activation with increased C1q, MBL, CFBb, C3a, C5a, and C5b-9, and reduced CFH. C1q, MBL, and CFBb peaked around day 17. MBL was higher in patients with poor outcome, CFBb was higher with good outcome, and C5b-9 in severe strokes. These findings reveal pathway-specific complement dynamics after AIS and support complement as a target for stage-specific therapy.",

      "title": "Multi-model deep learning for dementia detection: addressing data and model limitations",
      "content": "IntroductionDeep neural network architectures have transformed medical imaging, particularly in structural MRI (sMRI) classification. However, existing state-of-the-art deep learning models face limitations in preprocessing and feature extraction when classifying dementia-related conditions. This study addresses these challenges by evaluating multiple architectures for dementia diagnosis.MethodsThis study assessed eight pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a Vision Transformer (ViT), a multimodal attention model, and a capsule network (CapsNet) for classifying three classes: dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls. The dataset, obtained from ADNI, was balanced across classes and comprised 10,000 training images per class, 3,000 validation images per class, and 850 test images per class. Classification was performed using 2D slices from sMRI scans. Performance metrics included accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.ResultsAmong all evaluated models, the 3D-CNN and multimodal attention models achieved the highest performance, with accuracies of 84% and 86%, specificities of 83% and 86%, and sensitivities of 84% and 86%, respectively. The ViT and CapsNet models achieved 100% sensitivity for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) but demonstrated low precision for AD (43%) and 0% for other classes, indicating class imbalance effects. All models showed reduced performance and bias toward certain classes.DiscussionThe findings highlight the limitations of current architectures in sMRI dementia classification, including suboptimal feature extraction and class-specific biases. While certain models, such as multimodal attention and 3D-CNN, performed better overall, precision and generalization remain challenges. Future work should focus on improved data representation through advanced computer vision methods and architectural modifications to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "Late-onset severe neutropenia in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis treated with ocrelizumab: case report and literature review",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo describe two cases of recurrent, delayed-onset severe neutropenia several months following ocrelizumab therapy in patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).BackgroundA rare adverse effect of ocrelizumab is neutropenia, with late-onset neutropenia (LON) occurring more rarely. Literature guiding management of transient recurrent neutropenia in the setting of anti-CD20 therapy is lacking.MethodsCase 1: 38-year-old female emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Two years later, she developed severe symptomatic LON and required antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). Ocrelizumab was held, patient switched to ozanimod, but neutropenia recurred. Due to concerns of MS progression, ocrelizumab was restarted after the patient transitioned to a telehealth setting, with no recurrence of neutropenia at one-year follow-up. Case 2: 35-year-old male emergency physician with RRMS developed severe transient spontaneously resolving asymptomatic neutropenia 3\u202fmonths after ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab was resumed after absolute neutrophil count recovery. Two years later, he developed moderate symptomatic LON during a suspected viral illness. Ocrevus was discontinued at this point. A subsequent episode occurred 3\u202fmonths later during confirmed rhinovirus infection, again resolving promptly.ConclusionThese cases highlight the unpredictable nature of recurrent LON with ocrelizumab and suggest the possibility of immune-mediated marrow suppression, potentially unmasked or worsened by infections, rather than direct drug toxicity, highlighting the need for clearer management guidelines.",
