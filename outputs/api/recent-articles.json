      "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

      "title": "Evidence for an Active Handoff between Hemispheres during Target Tracking",
      "content": "<p>The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as two male nonhuman primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) power, gamma (30&ndash;80&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. In contrast, alpha (10&ndash;15&nbsp;Hz) power, theta (4&ndash;10&nbsp;Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active handoff of information between hemispheres. This \"handshaking\" operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.</p>",

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Circuit-level modeling of prediction error computation of multi-dimensional features in voluntary actions",
      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "title": "The time-varying brain: a comprehensive review of dynamic functional connectivity analysis in EEG and MEG",
      "content": "Objective. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the recent literature on dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis. This represents a paradigm shift in the analysis of neural data to overcome the inherent limitations of static assumptions about functional brain connectivity. By exploiting the information provided by high temporal resolution neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG), the possibility of tracking functional network organization and reconfiguration that support brain functions at different temporal scales has been extensively explored. Approach. This review examines the current state-of-the-art of the methodological approaches for dFC analysis in biomedical science, focusing on literature from 2018 to 2024 and on the analysis of EEG and MEG data. The review primarily concentrates on methods for estimating the time-resolved functional connectivity matrix, also providing an overview of approaches for summarising and inferring dynamic information. Main results. An insight into the available methodological approaches for tracking dFC at different temporal scales is offered. Besides the classical sliding window method, advances in instantaneous dFC algorithms are described and two novel approaches are introduced: microstate-based dFC (micro-dFC) and data-driven dFC methods. For each approach, specific features are detailed, and the dataset characteristics to ensure applicability are discussed. In addition, possible post-processing procedures for extracting the dynamic properties and information of interest are presented. Significance. The undoubted potential of dFC analysis for the study of brain dynamics is highlighted, providing a guide for its application, also taking into consideration the study protocol, the nature of the data and the temporal resolution of interest. Current limitations and open challenges are also critically addressed.",

      "title": "Neuromodulation for Tourette syndrome: current techniques and future perspectives",
      "content": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a chronic tic disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are nearly universal in TS, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. TS can have substantial effects on quality of life, social and intellectual development, opportunities, relationships, and more. Treatment options are limited; the most common being behavioral therapy and pharmacological interventions, such as antipsychotics and anti-adrenergic agents, often yielding unsatisfactory benefits. Neuromodulation, the alteration of neural pathways and networks under external stimulation, has been established as a viable treatment strategy for specific aspects of TS. Several neuromodulation techniques have been utilized, with deep brain stimulation (DBS) exhibiting the strongest efficacy at around 50% reduction of tics on average across cohorts. However, the invasive nature of DBS remains a disincentive for its uptake, as well as the natural reduction in tic severity for many TS individuals as they enter adulthood. Less-invasive neuromodulation has also been explored, but efficacy remains limited. Given its effectiveness in TS, DBS provides the unique opportunity to record neural activity from deep brain structures, which has been used to investigate underlying pathophysiology and search for biomarkers of treatment response. These insights may guide strategies for less invasive neuromodulation. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss currently utilized neuromodulation therapies for the treatment of TS, as well as propose potential future strategies. Additionally, we discuss how to maximize progress in the field, including crucial multicenter data sharing, utilization of recording capabilities on DBS devices, correlation with the precise location of implanted electrodes, and harnessing pre-clinical studies for a more parameterized understanding of TS neuromodulation. These techniques will enable a clearer understanding of TS and the mechanisms behind successful treatment. This could lead to advanced therapies that improve the quality of life for individuals with TS.",
