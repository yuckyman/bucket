      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

      "title": "Improved filter bank common spatial pattern algorithm based on the sparrow search algorithm",
      "content": "IntroductionThe application of motor imagery in human\u2013computer interaction and rehabilitative medicine has attracted growing attention due to recent advances in brain\u2013computer interface technologies. However, traditional EEG decoding paradigms based on fixed frequency\u2013band segmentation often exhibit limited performance because they fail to capture individual variability in brain rhythms.MethodsThis work proposes an adaptive method that integrates the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to optimize sub\u2013band segmentation for motor imagery EEG decoding. SSA adaptively searches for optimal sub\u2013band boundaries, enabling individualized frequency\u2013band selection.ResultsExperiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset under a cross\u2013session evaluation protocol (training on session T, testing on session E) demonstrated that SSA\u2013FBCSP effectively improves frequency\u2013band adaptability. The SSA\u2013FBCSP approach was further combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k\u2013Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers to evaluate the influence of different downstream classifiers.ConclusionAmong them, SSA\u2013FBCSP\u2013LDA achieved the best performance, outperforming the conventional uniform sub\u2013band approach by 21.76% and reaching an average accuracy of 89.92%. The adaptively selected sub\u2013bands closely matched the ERD/ERS distribution, confirming the method\u2019s effectiveness in frequency\u2013band optimization. Compared with recent deep\u2013learning\u2013based MI\u2013EEG models, the proposed technique offers a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

      "title": "Effect of deep brain stimulation on motor complications in Parkinson\u2019s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) significantly improves tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia for patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), but gait and speech remain inconsistent. These discrepancies underscore the need for a systematic, quantitative synthesis of existing data to clarify the impact of DBS across different motor domains.ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the effects of DBS on motor symptoms in PD by analyzing UPDRS-III scores and conducting subgroup analyses based on stimulation target, stimulation type, and medication status.MethodsA literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on clinical trials and observational studies reporting pre- and post-DBS motor assessments in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science from inception to 15 December 2024.ResultsA total of 35 studies comprising 1,082 PD patients were included. The pooled analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall UPDRS-III scores post-DBS (WMD: = \u22121.09, 95% CI: \u22121.32 to \u22120.87, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Subgroup analyses showed consistent improvements across tremor, rigidity, akinesia, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and axial symptoms, regardless of stimulation target or medication state. UPDRS Part IV scores also significantly improved, reflecting reduced motor complications. However, speech function remained unchanged, and UPDRS Part I scores initially showed no significant improvement, though significance emerged after removing sources of heterogeneity.ConclusionDBS significantly improves overall motor function, particularly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, its effects on gait and speech remain inconsistent, which shows the need for further research to refine patient selection and optimize stimulation parameters. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic impact of DBS in PD management.",

      "title": "Skull stripping tools in pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans: a retrospective evaluation of segmentation performance",
      "content": "IntroductionFor brain maturity assessment of infants aged above 6 months, T2-weighted MRI scans are recommended. Prior to automated brain tissue analysis, skull stripping is typically applied. However, most skull stripping tools neither focus on T2-weighted scans nor on pediatric cohorts. Here, we present the evaluation results of seven common skull stripping tools in a comparably large pediatric cohort.MethodsThis study is based on 199 T2-weighted scans of children under the age of 5 years retrospectively acquired from the clinical routine at Hannover Medical School. We established a manually labeled ground truth under quality control of a senior neuroradiologist specialized in pediatric neuroradiology and evaluated seven skull stripping tools (BET, ROBEX, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast, SynthStrip, SynthStrip-noCSF and d-SynthStrip). Segmentation performance (Dice score, 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, sensitivity, specificity) and computation time were assessed on non-preprocessed and preprocessed scans (zero padding, contrast enhancement, artifact removal and normalization) as well as in different brain regions. For the best performing model, we manually assessed the top and bottom quartile of segmentations with respect to the integrity of different anatomical brain structures.ResultsOnly BET, HD-BET, HD-BET-fast profited from data preprocessing. Considering this, all models had median Dice scores between 0.88 and 0.96, with SynthStrip performing best. All models segmented most accurately in the middle axial slices of the brain. Resampling lowered the performance of all models, except ROBEX. Mean computing times ranged from 2\u202fs (BET) to 132\u202fs (HD-BET) with SynthStrip requiring 7\u202fs. per scan. SynthStrip was prone to not entirely including the Sinus sagittalis superior, the upper Cerebrum, the temporal pole, the Cerebellum and the Chiasma opticum/pituitary gland. In contrast, the petrous bone and the skull in the middle axial slices have often been partly included.DiscussionDue to its robustness and quick computation time, we recommend SynthStrip for skull stripping of pediatric T2-weighted MRI scans. We attribute the observed segmentation errors to the partial volume effect, which should be addressed in future research. Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting, the exclusion of pathological cases and the skewed age distribution in our cohort.",

      "content": "IntroductionIn this study, we propose a data-driven approach that integrates behavioral diagnosis with neuroimaging features to identify representative UWS and MCS patients from a large inpatient cohort.MethodsClinical information was extracted using a subset of UWS patients with CRS-R scores \u2264 5. Neuroimaging biomarkers were established as the increased and decreased functional connectivity indices of anatomically defined regions covering the whole brain. The algorithm was implemented through an iterative refinement process that converged on a division of UWS and MCS patients into representative and excluded (or nonrepresentative) patient groups.ResultsThirty-one out of 58 UWS patients and 23 out of 30 MCS patients were identified as representative, with an average classification accuracy of 90.2% in differentiating between the two groups. In contrast, differentiating between excluded UWS patients (n =\u202f27) and representative MCS patients (n =\u202f23) and between all UWS (n =\u202f58) and MCS (n =\u202f30) patients produced average classification accuracies of 50.9 and 64.3%, respectively. Furthermore, altered DMN functional connectivity between representative UWS and MCS patients revealed a consistent pattern as shown in prior studies, while comparisons involving excluded patients did not.DiscussionThese results highlight the value of integrating behavioral scores and neural connectivity features for DOC classification, providing a more coherent basis for downstream analysis and machine-learning applications in DOC classification.",
