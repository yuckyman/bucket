The only real options are joining Discord, or watching markdown commits on GitHub, neither of which is ideal for everyone.</p>\n<p>To help make things easier, the following two changelog sites have been built.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://changes.fmhy.bid/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://changes.fmhy.bid/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers changes that occur in both the #Recently-Added and #Monthly-Update channels in our Discord.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers links that have been added, updated, or removed by watching GitHub for changes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note that we will also continue to make the monthly posts same as always, and you can still follow updates by joining our <a href=\"https://redd.it/17f8msf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a>, or watching the <a href=\"https://github.com/fmhy/edit/commits/main/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commits Page</a> on GitHub yourself.</p>\n<p>We hope you guys like them, if you have any suggestions or questions feel free to let us know.</p>",

      "title": "Brain-wide Organization of Post-Synaptic Sites: Three Principles",
      "content": "Synapses are fundamental units of neural computation and structural plasticity in the brain, yet their brain-wide spatial organization in mammals remains largely unknown. Building on our previous mapping and modeling of dendritic spines and axonal boutons, we developed a statistical approach to generate over 17.99 million predicted post-synaptic sites based on the potential arbor contacts (PPSSPAC) across the dendritic arbors of 155,743 neurons spanning the entire mouse brain. By analyzing the topological features of these sites, we identified three key organizational principles. First, PPSSPAC exhibits a distinct region-specific spatial pattern at the dendritic branch level, preferentially enriching near the distal ends of dendritic segments, in contrast to the valley-like distribution of pre-synaptic sites along axonal branches. Cross-species validation against independent electron microscopy datasets from mouse and human brains, revealed a conserved and previously unquantified pattern of synaptic organization. Second, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC effectively captures variations across cell types in the hippocampus, enabling neuron classification based on synaptic architecture. This serves as a complementary mesoscale descriptor to existing classifications based on global neuronal connectivity (source-target relationships) or local dendritic microenvironments. Third, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC, rather than synapse density, shows remarkable correlation with independent whole-brain electrophysiological activity. The spatial organization of PPSSPAC also correlates with several gene expression datasets. These results suggest the post-synaptic pattern could be mediator linking molecular signatures, neural dynamics, and connectivity types of cells. Our study reveals, for the first time, a structural substrate for hierarchical information processing in the brain, providing new insights into neural computation and a foundation for brain digital twin models to support next-generation AI infrastructure.",

      "title": "Neuronal excitability and parameter variability in the Hodgkin-Huxley model",
      "content": "Biophysically detailed neuron models are often built as a one-way pipeline in which voltage-clamp data are reduced to a single set of best-fit channel parameters, which are then combined into a deterministic spiking model. This practice discards experimentally observed variability and obscures the mechanisms by which robustness and degeneracy arise in excitable systems. Here, we reintroduce parameter variability into the Hodgkin-Huxley model and embed uncertainty and global sensitivity analysis into model construction. We digitized sodium and potassium rate constant data from the original Hodgkin and Huxley figures and used bootstrap resampling to estimate the variability of the voltage-dependent kinetic parameters. We then propagated these uncertainty estimates through a spatially extended squid axon cable model using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. At the channel level, first-order Sobol sensitivity indices revealed that all kinetic parameters contribute to output variance in a strongly time-dependent manner, with distinct parameters controlling transient and steady-state behavior for potassium and sodium conductances. At the level of neuronal excitability, sampling hundreds of thousands of parameter sets produced a heterogeneous population of firing behaviors, including non-firing, phasic, regular, and spontaneous activity. Across stimulus amplitudes, the dominant firing mode was a single spike at stimulus onset. At the same time, the regularly firing subpopulation exhibited a broad distribution of firing rates, with a mean that matched the classic Hodgkin-Huxley prediction. In the phasic subpopulation, action potential propagation and conduction velocity varied widely yet remained consistent with experimental ranges. Finally, global sensitivity analysis during spiking shows uniformly small first-order indices but large total-order indices, indicating that excitability is primarily governed by strong interactions among parameters rather than by any single conductance or kinetic parameter. These results support a population-based view of conductance-based modeling in which biologically relevant behavior emerges from structured regions of parameter space.",

      "title": "Cognition does not automatically influence perception: Evidence from neural encoding of colours belonging to different categories",
      "content": "The firmest evidence in favour of models that posit early high-level influences of cognition on perception comes from electroencephalography (EEG). Enhanced early, pre-attentive processing of light and dark blue feature changes compared to light and dark green changes was reported in Greek speakers, who have two basic terms for 'blue' (ghalazio/ble). In the present three-experiment study, we systematically re-evaluate this evidence and test an alternative model that the early difference waves in the human EEG instead mainly reflect contrast adaptation phenomena. We use the same classical oddball paradigm presenting alternating light or dark standards and deviants that systematically differ in colour and/or luminance and chromatic contrast. We then calculate the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), a putative index of pre-attentive feature change processing and predictive coding derived from EEG data, by subtracting the activity elicited by standards from that elicited by task-irrelevant deviants. Our experiments demonstrate the following: 1) vMMN is driven by contrast adaptation, being observable only in the presence of contrast differences between the stimuli and not reliably observed for different hues of equal contrast; 2) there is no reliable difference between green- and blue-related difference waves in speakers with two basic blue colour categories, the difference waves again driven by contrast rather than their categorical content. Our findings are highly significant for the debate concerning the interface between perception and cognition, as the absence of early categorical effects speaks against models that predict Whorfian-type cognitive influences.",
