      "title": "Spatial memory performance is associated with region-specific coordination of hippocampo-cortical sleep oscillations",
      "content": "Sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation, yet how coordination among sleep oscillations across hippocampo-cortical circuits relates to behavioral performance remains incompletely understood. Here, we examined how cross-regional coordination of cardinal sleep oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep relates to spatial memory performance. Adult rats were trained in an object-place recognition task and allowed to sleep while local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from dorsal and ventral hippocampus (CA1d and CA1v) and retrosplenial, prefrontal, and lateral entorhinal cortices. We first confirm that nREM sleep duration, but not REM sleep, is positively associated with spatial memory performance. We then characterized the temporal relationships between hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and cortical spindles and slow oscillations, revealing region- and oscillation-specific coordination patterns that depend on the dorso-ventral origin of hippocampal ripple events. Finally, by comparing task-related changes in ripple-triggered cortical activity between low- and high-performing sessions, we identify selective, performance-dependent modulation of hippocampo-cortical coupling during task-related sleep. Spatial memory performance was consistently associated with enhanced ripple-spindle and ripple-slow oscillation coupling driven by dorsal hippocampal ripples, particularly in interactions with entorhinal and prefrontal cortices, whereas ventral hippocampal interactions failed to show behavioural association. Together, these results reveal that spatial memory performance is linked to region- and timing-specific coordination of sleep oscillations across hippocampo-cortical networks during nREM sleep, highlighting a functional differentiation of dorsal and ventral hippocampal contributions to sleep-dependent memory consolidation.",

      "title": "The Extremely Brilliant Brain: An Isotropic Microscale Human Brain Dataset",
      "content": "We present an isotropic 7.72 microns/voxel post-mortem human brain dataset acquired using Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) at the ESRF Extremely Brilliant Source, beamline BM18. This fills a critical gap between whole-brain MRI at 100-micron resolution and serial-section histological reconstructions at 20 microns or finer. HiP-CT contrast, derived from X-ray phase shifts, enables rich 3D visualisation of complex neuroanatomy including white-matter bundles, microvasculature, and sub-nuclei. We provide open-source workflows for online data exploration, subvolume download, segmentation, and reintegration of analyses into the full dataset. We demonstrate the potential of this resource by tracing vasculature over long distances, segmenting nuclei, and extracting white-matter orientations with 3D structure-tensor analysis. High-resolution human brain datasets are transformative for quantitative neuroanatomy, circuit mapping, and validation of clinical imaging; this openly available resource is a critical step for global access to next-generation multiscale brain imaging.",

      "title": "Sparse input representations explain odor discrimination in complex, concentration-varying mixtures",
      "content": "In natural environments, animals must detect behaviorally relevant odors despite variability in both odor mixture composition and stimulus intensity. Although mice can identify salient odors embedded in complex mixtures, how target concentration and background complexity jointly constrain discrimination remains unclear. We trained mice in a two-alternative forced choice task to identify target odors embedded in mixtures containing up to 16 background components. After performance stabilized, we systematically varied target odor concentration. Discrimination accuracy declined with decreasing target concentration but showed little additional dependence on background complexity. Using a biophysically grounded model of olfactory bulb glomerular responses, we show that linear decoding reproduces behavioral performance when intrinsic neural noise dominates over background-driven variability. Manifold capacity analysis revealed that neural representations remain efficiently structured for odor discrimination despite variation in background complexity. These results define a noise-limited regime of olfactory discrimination in which target detectability is primarily constrained by neural sensitivity rather than background interference.",

      "title": "Large-Scale Control of Neuronal Networks In Vitro Using Perforated Microfluidic Devices",
      "content": "Neurons in the brain are organized and connected into complex networks in which electrochemical signaling forms the basis for all brain function. Cortical neuronal networks are arranged in distinct modular, layered, and hierarchical structures, underlying its diverse functions such as learning, memory, or vision. Modern biotechnology has enabled an array of techniques to culture human neural cells, ranging from discreet co-cultures to complex developmental organoids, but all of which almost exclusively form unstructured and hypersynchronous networks. Overcoming this and capturing the functional and anatomical properties of the brain textit{in vitro} has proven to be a great challenge. Current techniques for guiding neuronal connectivity textit{in vitro} is often limited to a small fraction of the total population of neural cells, leaving most of the culture effectively unguided. To provide large-scale guidance of neurons in culture, we developed a microtunnel device which allows large-scale cell entry through an array of perforations, and guides neuronal network formation through a series of tunnels. Human neural stem cells capable of forming extensive neuronal projections were used to investigate several different microtunnel designs. One particularity noteworthy design which produced predominantly unidirectional growth was used to successfully validate its effect on propagation of neural activity on microelectrode arrays. Serendipitously, we found that our microtunnels had an extraordinary effect on signal-to-noise ratio and the quality of electrophysiological recordings with regards to number of active channels and detected spikes. Since we often found the neuronal growth surprising, we developed a simple computer model which could reproduce neuronal growth in the various tunnels, allowing computer aided design (CAD) of future projects.",

      "title": "Task-Dependent Effects of Channel Density on Multivariate Pattern Analysis and Spatial Representational Similarity Analysis: Evidence from Three EEG Datasets",
      "content": "Despite the widespread use of EEG decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA), the extent of the impact of electrode density on these multivariate approaches has not been systematically evaluated, particularly across different cognitive domains. Here, we systematically compared four electrode configurations (19, 32, 64, and 128 channels) across three EEG datasets encompassing visual perception, visual search, and emotional processing. All datasets were recorded at 128 channels and subsequently reduced to 64, 32, and 19 channels via electrode subset selection based on the international 10-20 system. Time-resolved decoding and spatial RSA were computed for each configuration with paired statistical evaluation. Decoding sensitivity demonstrated clear task dependence: in the color-harmony paradigm, performance improved markedly with higher densities, consistent with spatially distributed perceptual representations, whereas decoding in the icon-search and dot-probe tasks remained stable across densities, indicating diminishing returns of additional electrodes although all configuration yielded robust decoding accuracies that above chance level. RSA results were comparatively robust, with relative representational similarity structures largely preserved even for 16 channel counts. These findings demonstrate that low-density setups can be sufficient, offering practical guidance for EEG channel selection and supporting the use of low-density EEG in real-world applications, including wearable systems, mobile EEG recordings, and clinical or rehabilitation settings.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
