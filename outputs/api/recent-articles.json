      "content": "IntroductionThe accumulation of genomic and brain data opens new opportunities for resource friendly, data driven brain exploration. A key challenge is to develop versatile and accessible strategies that integrate and mine multimodal datasets for novel neuroscientific insights. Here, we optimized an integrated workflow for mapping multigenic evolutionary traits in the human brain across cognitive, cellular, and molecular levels.MethodsAt the input stage, the workflow fuses an evolutionary genetic dataset with searchable synthetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) databases that are pre clustered into concise psychological domains for improved interpretability. At its core, a Genetic Algorithm for Generalized Biclustering (GABi) mines gene sets under evolutionary selection that also show high expression correlation with fMRI networks.ResultsApplying this workflow, we identified evolutionary patterns spanning cognitive traits, brain cell types, and molecular mechanisms. Focusing on socio affective traits, the algorithm highlighted peaks in adaptive selection in networks for social interaction (language) and social concepts (theory of mind) across hominid, early hominin, and anatomically modern human (AMH) ancestry. These traits emerge from a broad spectrum of excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neuronal, as well as non neuronal, cell types. The associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms were enriched for cell signaling, synaptic organization, and neuronal morphology.DiscussionTogether, these findings demonstrate an integrated workflow for molecular to systems level exploration of the brain and provide new perspectives on the evolutionary history of human socio affective functions. This approach can be adapted to screen for functional traits in the context of mental disorders or applied to the brains of other phylogenies in a similar manner.",

      "title": "Diagnostically competitive performance of a physiology-informed generative multi-task network for contrast-free CT perfusion",
      "content": "Perfusion imaging is extensively utilized to assess hemodynamic status and tissue perfusion in various organs. Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging plays a key role in the early assessment and planning of stroke treatment. While CTP provides essential perfusion parameters to identify abnormal blood flow in the brain. However, CTP can be expensive with limited accessibility, and the use of contrast agents in CTP can lead to allergic reactions and adverse side effects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning framework called Multitask Automated Generation of Intermodal CT perfusion maps (MAGIC). This framework combines generative artificial intelligence and physiological information to map non-contrast computed tomography (CT) imaging to multiple contrast-free CTP imaging maps. We demonstrate enhanced image fidelity by incorporating physiological characteristics into the loss terms. Our network was trained and validated using CT image data from patients referred for stroke at UF Health and demonstrated robustness to abnormalities in brain perfusion activity. A double-blinded study was conducted involving seven experienced neuroradiologists and vascular neurologists. This study validated MAGIC's visual quality and diagnostic accuracy showing favorable performance compared to clinical perfusion imaging with intravenous contrast injection. Overall, MAGIC holds great promise in revolutionizing healthcare by offering contrast-free, cost-effective, and rapid perfusion imaging.",

      "title": "Biomarkers Identifying Tendency to Suicide (BITS): detection of biomarkers in adolescents with suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior for early prevention or intervention. A prospective cohort study",
      "content": "Adolescent suicidality represents a major and persistent public health concern, with sustained increases in suicidal ideation and behaviors observed in recent years. Although suicide risk is widely conceptualized as a complex and multifactorial phenomenon, biological vulnerability factors remain insufficiently integrated into adolescent clinical assessment frameworks. In particular, neuroinflammatory processes, hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and alterations in blood-brain barrier integrity have emerged as potentially relevant but underexplored contributors to suicidality. This prospective clinical cohort study adopts an integrative, multi-method approach to enhance the characterization of suicidality among help-seeking adolescents. We hypothesize that adolescents with suicidal ideation or suicidal behaviors will show distinct peripheral biomarker profiles compared with adolescents without suicidal concerns. The primary analyses focus on group differences at baseline in inflammatory cytokines, markers of systemic inflammation, HPA-axis activity, and blood-brain barrier-related biomarkers, as well as measures of suicidality severity and global functioning. Secondary outcomes include associations between biomarker levels and psychopathological severity and functioning, and longitudinal changes in biological and clinical measures, including transitions in suicidality status, over a 2-month follow-up. Participants will undergo a comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment and standardized peripheral blood sampling at baseline and follow-up. By integrating biological measures with detailed psychological and behavioral profiling within a longitudinal design, this protocol aims to establish a framework for biomarker-informed risk stratification of high-risk adolescents, ultimately informing more precise and developmentally sensitive suicide prevention strategies.",

      "title": "Excluding spontaneous thought periods enhances functional connectivity test\u2013retest reliability and machine learning performance in fMRI",
      "content": "IntroductionResting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a widely used non-invasive technique for investigating brain function and identifying potential disease biomarkers. Compared with task-based fMRI, rs-fMRI is easier to acquire because it does not require explicit task paradigms. However, functional connectivity measures derived from rs-fMRI often exhibit poor reliability, which substantially limits their clinical applicability.MethodsTo address this limitation, we propose a novel method termed time-enhanced functional connectivity, which improves reliability by identifying and removing poor-quality time points from rs-fMRI time series. This approach aims to enhance the quality of functional connectivity estimation without extending scan duration or relying on dataset-specific constraints.ResultsExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves performance in downstream machine learning tasks, such as sex classification. In addition, time-enhanced functional connectivity yields higher test\u2013retest reliability and reveals more pronounced statistical differences between groups compared with conventional functional connectivity measures.DiscussionThese findings suggest that selectively removing low-quality time points provides a practical and effective strategy for improving the reliability and sensitivity of functional connectivity measurements in rs-fMRI, thereby enhancing their potential utility in both neuroscience research and clinical applications.",

      "content": "Background/objectivesThe existing literature on normative data for accommodative facility (AF) in African populations is limited to high school students. There is no normative data for vergence facility (VF) in African children, so there are no benchmarks for comparison in case analysis, diagnosis, and management. The study aimed to establish normative data for AF in children aged 8\u201312\u202fyears. Additionally, the study sought to determine normative data for VF in children aged 8\u201317\u202fyears in the Cape Coast metropolis, Ghana.MethodsNormal children (510) were recruited through a comprehensive oculo-visual examination of 2,300 basic school-going children, aged 8\u201317\u202fyears. AF was measured with a\u202f\u00b1\u202f2D flipper lens for 1 min. VF was measured with a 3-base-in/12 base-out flipper prism for 1 min. Normative data were derived using the median with interquartile ranges (IQR) and considering the spread of data within the minimum and maximum ranges.ResultsA median value of 13 cpm with IQR of 4 cpm was determined for monocular accommodative facility (MAF). The normative central tendency for MAF for school children 8\u201317\u202fyears ranges from 9 to 17\u202fcpm; data were widely spread, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 20\u202fcpm. A median value of 13 cpm with IQR of 3 cpm was determined for the binocular accommodative facility (BAF). The normative central tendency for BAF for school children aged 8\u201317\u202fyears ranged from 9 to 14\u202fcpm; data were widely spread, with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 20\u202fcpm. A median value of 14 cpm with IQR of 4 cpm was determined for VF. The normative central tendency for VF for school children 8\u201317\u202fyears ranged from 10 to 18\u202fcpm; data were widely spread, with a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 21\u202fcpm.ConclusionThe normative data apply only to similarly aged Ghanaian children and serve as standards for comparison to clinical data for MAF, BAF, and VF during case analysis.",

      "title": "Adolescent Social Isolation Facilitates Tau Spread in Raphe Nuclei Linking Depression and Hyperalgesia in Alzheimers Disease",
      "content": "Tau pathology in brainstem serotonergic circuits drives early neuropsychiatric dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD), yet mechanisms linking the exposome, particularly social stress exposures to depression and altered pain perception, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adolescent social isolation, a critical psychosocial exposome factor and major trigger of depression, facilitates tau propagation in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and downstream raphe nuclei, producing both neuropsychiatric and pain-related sequelae. Tau[P301L] was transduced into the DRN of 30-day socially isolated or group housed C57BL/6J mice using AAV, with control mice receiving AAV-GFP. Four weeks post-transduction, anxiety, social behavior, and pain sensitivity were assessed, and phosphorylated tau (ptau) within the DRN and spread to the median raphe (MRN) and raphe magnus (RMg) serotonergic neurons were evaluated. Socially isolated tau[P301L] mice exhibited hyperlocomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social deficits and hyperalgesia. Histological analysis revealed elevated ptau within TPH2 neurons in the DRN and trans-synaptic tau spread to MRN and RMg, accompanied by reduced TPH2 and increased ptau at the downstream raphe nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed altered expression of Slc6a4 and Tgm2, a stress-responsive gene implicated in AD. These results indicate that DRN tau under social stress drives neuropsychiatric phenotypes, while tau spread to MRN and RMg disrupts serotonergic modulation of pain. This study provides the first evidence that adolescent stress promotes tau propagation within the raphe nuclei, linking early neuropsychiatric and pain-processing deficits to prodromal Alzheimers disease and identifying a critical pathway through which psychosocial exposome risk converges with tau pathology to enable early intervention.",

      "title": "Higher-Order Thalamus is Pivotal in Schizophrenia-Associated Pathophysiology",
      "content": "Synaptic dysfunction has been proposed as cellular pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia, yet the brain-wide distribution of dysfunctional circuits at single-neuron resolution has remained unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive multi-probe electrophysiological investigations in vivo in the Grin2a+/- preclinical model for schizophrenia and control animals, recording across ~45 brain regions spanning cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus. Mutants displayed distributed and graded alterations across regions, with prominent activity reductions in higher-order thalamus and cross-parameter alterations across prefrontal cortices, striatum, and hippocampus. Restoration of higher-order thalamic activity in mutants was sufficient to normalize alterations in connected prefrontal cortices and striatum and unexpectedly cascaded distally to hippocampus and sensory cortices. Thus, higher-order thalamus plays a pivotal role in schizophrenia pathophysiology and restoration of a single informed locus could present a potent therapeutic strategy.",
