      "title": "Sex-specific effects of fecal microbiota transplantation on TBI-exacerbated Alzheimer's pathology in mice",
      "content": "Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accelerates Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and neuroinflammation, potentially via gut-brain axis disruptions. Whether restoring gut microbial homeostasis mitigates TBI-exacerbated AD features remains unclear, particularly with respect to sex differences. Objective: The goal of our study was to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) modifies amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, gut microbial composition, metabolites, and motor outcomes in male and female 5xFAD mice subjected to TBI. Methods: Male and female 5xFAD mice received sham treatments or controlled cortical impact, followed 24 hours later by vehicle (VH) or sex-matched FMT from C57BL/6 donors. Assessments at baseline, 1, and 3 days post-injury included Thioflavin-S and 6E10 immunostaining for Abeta, Iba-1 and GFAP for glial activation, lesion volume, rotarod performance, 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiome profiling, serum short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut histology. Results: TBI increased cortical and dentate gyrus Abeta burden, with females showing greater vulnerability. FMT reduced Abeta deposition in sham animals and shifted plaque morphology but did not attenuate TBI-induced amyloid escalation. FMT differentially modulated glial responses by sex and region (reduced microgliosis in males) without altering lesion volume. Rotarod performance was better in sham females compared to males and declined in FMT-treated TBI females. Fecal microbiome alpha diversity and richness were unchanged, while beta diversity revealed marked, time-dependent community shifts after TBI that were slightly altered by FMT. Gut morphology remained broadly intact, but crypt width increased after TBI, particularly in males. Conclusion: In 5xFAD mice, TBI drives sex-dependent worsening of amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and dysbiosis. Acute FMT partially restores microbial composition and plaque features in sham animals but fails to reverse TBI-induced neuroinflammation or motor deficits. These findings underscore the context- and sex-dependence of microbiome interventions and support longer-term, sex-specific strategies for AD with comorbid TBI.",

      "title": "Impact of > 24 h sustained wakefulness and subsequent recovery sleep on time-dependent changes in microRNA factors of individuals with post-acute phase mild traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "Introduction: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI+) results in latent changes in microRNA expression profiles across an episode of total sleep deprivation (TSD). Methods: Seven previously concussed (mTBI+) adults (24.5 y.o.) and 6 non-concussed control adults (mTBI-; 24.8 y.o.) underwent 24 h TSD (T2) preceded by 8 h baseline sleep (T1; BSL) and followed by 8 h recovery (T3; REC) sleep. Salivary microRNA expression was assessed across the entire study. Results: Subjects (mTBI+ and mTBI-) had differential expression of salivary microRNA targets across TSD. mTBI+ subjects had greater change to microRNA expression profiles compared to mTBI- subjects between T1 and T3. Discussion: Although there is some evidence that TSD may unmask latent changes in gene expression in mTBI+ subjects, a definitive conclusion was precluded by differences in baseline sleep in mTBI+ (vs. mTBI-) subjects measured through polysomnography (data not shown). However, this study is unique in that the mTBI+ subjects were exposed to a sleep deprivation challenge very shortly after medical clearance from mTBI demonstrating lingering neurobiological impacts of mTBI.",

      "title": "Building an Ecosystem of Seizure Localization Methods: Neural Fragility as the First Step",
      "content": "The current treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) is surgical intervention, which relies on accurate identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. iEEG analysis with computational epileptogenic zone identification algorithms (CEZIAs) is a promising step towards better SOZ localization and surgical outcomes. A key step in validation and adoption of CEZIAs is to allow for widespread shared development and validation of code and data. We describe a set of three R packages to achieve this goal. Our ecosystem of seizure localization methods involves a straightforward analysis pipeline, standardized data formatting and storage, and completely documented and open-source code. The TableContainer package allows for easy storage and manipulation of table data, serving as groundwork for the Epoch package, which is specifically geared towards iEEG data. The Epoch package allows for cropping, resampling, and visualization of iEEG data and provides publicly downloadable iEEG data for reproducibility. Finally, the EZFragility package uses these two foundational packages to analyze iEEGs for SOZ localization using the Neural Fragility method described by Li et al. EZFragility was built using the same core principles as the original method but included several enhancements in computational efficiency and user experience. It accurately reproduces neural fragility results for both sample patients used in the original paper. This project serves as the first step towards building an open-source, reproducible ecosystem of seizure localization methods in R. Future steps include the addition of other CEZIAs using the framework and sample data already made available by these packages.",

      "title": "Discriminative power of diverse nonlinear EEG dynamics across consciousness states during auditory stimulation in disorders of consciousness",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study addressed the challenge of assessing consciousness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) using nonlinear dynamic parameters applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics stimulated by music.MethodEEG signals from 57 patients with DOC at the Rehabilitation Medical Center of the Second Hospital of Shandong University were analyzed using the Lyapunov Exponent (LE), Approximate Entropy (ApEn), Lempel\u2013Ziv Complexity (LZC), and Correlation Dimension (D2). These parameters were then correlated with the total CRS-R score to evaluate their effectiveness. The results indicated that preferred music significantly improved cortical excitability in minimally conscious state (MCS) patients, as evidenced by the ApEn, LZC, and D2 algorithms, but had no significant effect on vegetative state (VS)/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients.ResultsLE, however, showed significant responsiveness in the frontal and middle temporal lobes of patients with VS/UWS. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between changes in ApEn, LZC, and D2 due to musical stimulation and the total CRS-R score, whereas the LE showed no such correlation.ConclusionApEn, LZC, and D2 are valuable for assessing and distinguishing conscious states in patients with DOC, with LE providing supplementary information for patients with VS/UWS. Nonlinear EEG parameters offer promising reference values for effective clinical interventions in DOC.",
