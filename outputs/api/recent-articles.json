      "title": "4E-BP2-dependent translational control in GABAergic interneurons is required for long-term memory",
      "content": "mRNA translational repression by eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and the formation of long-term memory (LTM). Among the three 4E-BP paralogs, 4E-BP2 is the predominant form expressed in neurons, and its full-body deletion in mice causes memory deficits. Mice lacking 4E-BP2 in GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, but not excitatory neurons, display autistic-like behaviors and deficits in object location and recognition. The specific mRNAs translationally regulated by 4E-BP2 in GABAergic interneurons, and how they contribute to spatial and associative memory, are unknown. Here, we show that conditional knockout (cKO) mice lacking 4E-BP2 selectively in GABAergic interneurons exhibit impairments in long-term spatial and contextual fear memory formation. We further demonstrate that 4E-BP2 deletion controls the translation of selective mRNAs in interneurons without increasing general protein synthesis. One of the mRNAs is Gal, which encodes a neuropeptide that modulates memory. Our findings provide evidence that 4E-BP2 selectively controls the translation of a subset of mRNAs in inhibitory neurons that are required for LTM formation.",

      "title": "Distinct neurophysiological features and memory representations along the long axis of the developing medial temporal lobe",
      "content": "The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is crucial for episodic memory, whereby posterior MTL preferentially represents visuospatial information, and anterior MTL is involved in the representation of semantic or conceptual information. The neurophysiological underpinnings of content-preferential organization in the developing MTL are largely unknown. Here we utilized rare electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings from 23 pediatric epilepsy patients who completed a visual scene recognition memory task to systematically examine the neurophysiological underpinnings of memory formation along the MTL long axis. The timing of high-frequency activity (HFA, ~70-150 Hz) differed between the posterior and anterior MTL, peaking after scene onset in the posterior MTL and around scene category response (indoor/outdoor scene categorization) in the anterior MTL. Further, in the posterior MTL, HFA was predictive of successful memory formation and positively linked to memory performance, highlighting the importance of posterior MTL HFA to memory formation. In contrast, theta frequency in the anterior MTL was linked to memory performance, and theta-HFA phase-amplitude coupling before scene category responses was predictive of successful memory formation, highlighting the importance of anterior MTL theta oscillations to memory formation. Our findings establish distinct neurophysiological features along the posterior-to-anterior axis of the developing MTL that differentially support the representation of perceptual and conceptual information during memory formation.",

      "title": "Noradrenergic Modulation of an Amygdalo-thalamic Circuit",
      "content": "Emotional and cognitive processing rely on communication between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The BLA regulates mPFC both directly and indirectly via the medial sub-division of the medial dorsal thalamus (MDm). Although the BLA projection to MDm has been established anatomically, less is known about the functional properties of this synapse. Here, using patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics in ex vivo mouse brain slices, we found that BLA neurons make potent synaptic connections onto MDm neurons capable of evoking action potentials. The site of this BLA input overlaps with strong innervation from locus coeruleus norepinephrine (NE) axons. We found that NE acts via 2-adrenergic receptors to strongly reduce excitatory postsynaptic currents from BLA to MDm. NE also decreases the release probability of BLA axon terminals through a presynaptic mechanism. Postsynaptically, NE depolarizes MDm neurons and increases their tonic firing rates. These findings show that NE, whose levels are elevated during arousal and stress, can suppress transmission of affective information from BLA into MDm, thereby blunting this potent indirect pathway from BLA to mPFC.",

      "content": "Auditory externalization, the perception of a sound source as located outside the head, is essential for spatial hearing and auditory scene analysis. However, its neural correlates remain poorly understood. This study investigated differences in brain activation elicited by externalized versus internalized sound sources. Twenty-nine healthy participants underwent a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan while listening to auditory stimuli presented in three spatialization conditions: reverberant externalized sounds (highest externalization), anechoic externalized sounds (intermediate externalization) and diotic anechoic sounds (internalized). Whole-brain analyses revealed greater activation for externalized compared to internalized sound sources in the left superior temporal gyrus, including the planum temporale, the cerebellum and the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Internalized sounds elicited greater relative activity in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Direct comparison between the two externalized conditions revealed stronger left superior temporal gyrus activation for reverberant sounds, while anechoic sounds preferentially activated the right middle temporal gyrus. These findings confirmed the key role of the planum temporale in auditory externalization and the involvement of higher-order brain regions, suggesting broader networks underpinning the perception of sound location.",

      "content": "Loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP), a neurophysiological measure that reflects central serotonergic activity, is also influenced by the noradrenaline and dopamine systems. While it has been used in investigations of various psychiatric disorders, the fundamental characteristics in healthy individuals remain largely unknown. The present exploratory study examined 60 healthy adults to determine the associations of LDAEP with psychological traits assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The participants completed TCI and STAI questionnaires before undergoing electrophysiological recordings. LDAEP was measured based on the peak-to-peak amplitude slopes of P50/N100 and N100/P200 across five sound intensity levels. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, moderate negative correlations of LDAEP slopes with harm avoidance (HA) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) scores were noted. Additionally, sex-adjusted analysis showed novelty seeking to be positively associated with LDAEP. These findings suggest an association of LDAEP with individual differences in harm avoidance, trait anxiety, and novelty seeking in healthy adults. This supports the potential use of LDAEP as a non-invasive biomarker to predict treatment response in major depressive disorder, as well as in anxiety-related conditions.",

      "content": "IntroductionPerinatal brain injury is a leading cause of cerebral palsy. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) provides a non-invasive method for investigating motor pathway development; however, data on the safety and feasibility of its repeated use in infants are limited. This study provides the first longitudinal evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of spTMS in infants with perinatal brain injury.MethodsTwenty infants with perinatal brain injury (corrected age 3\u201325 months) participated in 46 spTMS sessions while awake. Safety and tolerability were systematically assessed using heart rate, respiratory rate, and the Modified Behavioral Pain Scale (MBPS). Feasibility was quantified by session completion, participant retention, and acquisition of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from bilateral wrist flexors.ResultsAcross 2,527 pulses, no adverse events occurred. Physiological measures and MBPS scores remained stable from pre- to post-stimulation. Analyzable electromyography (EMG) was obtained in 100% of sessions, with MEPs successfully elicited in 44/46 sessions (95.7%) across 19/20 infants (95%). A high longitudinal retention rate (85%) further demonstrated excellent protocol acceptability.DiscussionThese findings establish a safe, reproducible framework for longitudinal spTMS in a vulnerable infant population. This methodological advance enables future investigations into neuroplasticity and corticospinal tract development after early brain injury, with the potential to yield biomarkers that guide the timing and targets of early interventions.",

      "title": "Brainstem neurochemical profiles after hospitalisation for COVID-19: a 7T MR spectroscopy study",
      "content": "BackgroundSomatic, cognitive and mental health issues have been identified in three-quarters of people 5\u202fmonths after hospitalisation for severe acute SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection. The underlying neuroanatomical basis of these symptoms remains unclear, but recent studies suggest a role for altered brainstem physiology. We aimed to test the hypothesis that brainstem neurochemical profiles differ in patients who had been hospitalised for COVID-19 compared to matched controls using 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).MethodsThis prospective case\u2013control study recruited 34 individuals who were hospitalised for COVID-19 and 15 healthy controls with no history of COVID-19 infection from two major UK hospitals before vaccines became available. The participants underwent 7T semi-adiabatic localization by adiabatic selective refocusing (sLASER) 1H-MRS at the ponto-medullary junction. Water-referenced metabolite concentrations were compared between the patients and controls and correlated with infection severity, as measured by maximum C-reactive protein (CRPmax) assay during inpatient admission. Linear mixed modelling was used with a 0.05 significance level.ResultsSpectral quality was high/acceptable in 44/49 participants according to the MRS Consensus criteria. The magnitude of inflammation during patient admission (i.e., CRPmax) correlated positively with myo-inositol concentration (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.005, p\u202f=\u202f0.035), as did patient-reported symptoms (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.564, p\u202f=\u202f0.023). However, metabolite concentrations were not significantly different between the patients and controls.ConclusionWe show the feasibility of assessing brainstem neurochemical profiles using 7T 1H-MRS in a multi-centre study. Technical limitations at one site\u2019s 7T MRI led to variable repetition times, which limited our statistical power and should be avoided in future studies. Our findings highlight the need for further investigation into the role of neuroinflammation in post-acute COVID-19.",

      "content": "Background/objectivesThe pupil, a dynamic ocular structure, serves as a critical indicator of neurological and ophthalmological function. This interdisciplinary review explores the anatomical, physiological, and pathological aspects of pupillary reflexes and disorders.ContentEmphasis is placed on the diagnostic relevance of light and accommodation reflexes, sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, and the clinical implications of conditions such as Horner\u2019s syndrome, Adie\u2019s tonic pupil, and Argyll Robertson pupil. The utility of pharmacological testing and pupillometry in localizing lesions and identifying subclinical changes is extensively discussed. Advancements in pupillary assessment\u2013particularly dynamic and chromatic pupillometry\u2013offer novel insights into autonomic nervous system dysfunction, neurodegenerative diseases, and retinal pathologies including glaucoma and retinitis pigmentosa.Recent findingsBy integrating classical examination techniques with modern imaging and measurement modalities, the pupil emerges as a valuable biomarker in systemic, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. This review underscores the necessity of collaborative, multidisciplinary approaches for accurate diagnosis and effective management of pupillary abnormalities.ConclusionParticular attention is given to the diagnostic and prognostic applications of pupillometry, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pupillary abnormalities, and the utility of pharmacological tests in lesion localization. By consolidating foundational knowledge with recent clinical and technological developments, this review offers an updated framework for understanding pupillary function and dysfunction and highlights the importance of collaborative approaches across medical specialties for improved diagnostic accuracy and patient care.",

      "title": "Endovascular management of tandem embolic stroke due to cardioembolic free-floating thrombus: a case report",
      "content": "BackgroundTandem lesions (TLs), defined as simultaneous occlusions of both extracranial and intracranial arteries, represent a particularly challenging subset of large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes. While most TLs are attributed to atherosclerotic changes or arterial dissection, a smaller subset originates from cardioembolic emboli arising from the heart or aortic arch, commonly referred to as embolic tandem lesions. In rare instances, these emboli form a free-floating thrombus (FFT) in the carotid artery, characterized by mobile intraluminal thrombotic material with high embolic potential. Optimal treatment strategies for these rare and complex cases remain undefined.Case summaryWe present a rare case involving an embolic tandem lesion in a 73-year-old male with known atrial fibrillation who presented with acute ischemic stroke upon awakening. Imaging and angiography demonstrated a free-floating thrombus (FFT) at the brachiocephalic bifurcation extending into the origins of the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries, a free-floating thrombus at the carotid bifurcation, and an additional thrombus occluding the right ICA terminus and the origin of the M1 segment. A staged endovascular approach was employed: intracranial recanalization was first achieved via mechanical thrombectomy, followed by stent-assisted stabilization of the residual free-floating thrombus within the common carotid artery. The patient experienced significant neurological improvement and attained functional independence at 3-month follow-up.ConclusionThis case underscores the diagnostic and therapeutic complexity associated with embolic tandem lesions and carotid FFT involvement. Comprehensive preprocedural imaging, including assessment of the aortic arch and cervical vessels, is critical. A personalized, multi-modality endovascular approach combining thrombectomy and stenting can enable successful revascularization and favorable clinical outcomes, particularly when FFT complicates tandem occlusions.",

      "content": "When beliefs in autobiographical memories are reduced while recollections remain relatively intact, a phenomenon termed nonbelieved memories (NBMs) unfolds. The current preregistered study (<em>N</em> = 104) used a 3-week longitudinal design to investigate the relationships between the frequency of recalled NBMs, memory distrust, rumination over autobiographical events, and self-esteem. Our analyses showed that memory distrust was a positive predictor for the initial recall of NBMs during the past 2 months at Time 1, but not for the follow-up recalls of NBMs during the past week at Times 2\u20134. Exploratory analyses showed that, at Time 1, self-esteem was negatively associated with the total number of NBMs. Furthermore, the tendency to report involuntary memories and rumination over memories was positively associated with the total number of NBMs. In addition, (in)voluntary autobiographical memory recall tendency was also a significant positive predictor for the total number of NBMs at Times 2\u20134. Our study is one of the first to show that NBMs might be uniquely tied to specific individual markers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "Dissociation is a phenomenon present in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders as well as in the general population. The objective of this study was to examine the relation between trait thought suppression (TS) and development of dissociative phenomena in the nonclinical population, with emphasis on the potential mediating role of rumination and unusual sleep experiences (USEs) in a population with no psychiatric pathology. The sample was comprised of 482 participants from the general population (61.2% women) with a mean age of 31.28 (<em>SD</em> = 13.4). They completed the TS Scale (White Bear Suppression Inventory), Ruminative Response Scale, Iowa Sleep Experiences Survey, the Dissociative Experiences Scale, 2nd version Revised, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale\u201321. The results supported the original hypothesis and showed a positive correlation between trait TS and dissociation on one hand, and, on the other hand, between TS, rumination, and USEs. A serial mediation analysis showed that rumination and USEs mediated trait TS and dissociative states. Our study underlines the importance of variables related to TS, rumination, and USEs in understanding dissociative experiences and the importance of considering these variables in developing new theoretical dissociation models.

      "title": "Mental pain, boredom, and diffuse nociception.",
      "content": "In this article, I propose a novel theory to explain the possible physiological origins of the relatively mild mental pain that is often labeled as boredom and possibly loneliness or a negative mood, depending on one\u2019s situation. My admittedly speculative hypothesis is that most people in modern societies are beset by a chronic level of diffuse nociception (DN), due to the lingering effects of past stressors. For most people, most of the time, their DN is mild enough to be kept out of conscious awareness by various distractions. However, when people are deprived of all their usual distractions, DN may enter awareness and provoke a feeling of pain without being associated with any noticeable bodily sensation to which the pain can be localized. Thus, the discomfort is experienced as mental pain. It follows that whatever can reduce DN and/or keep it out of awareness will be positively reinforced, leading to an addiction to various distractions, including mind wandering. In support of my theory, I discuss research on how the activity of well-known neural networks serves to regulate the intensity of physical, as well as mental, pain. I also discuss individual differences in DN and their relationship to boredom proneness and neuroticism. Finally, I describe how stress reactions can create DN, how psychological factors can mitigate mental pain, and how chronic stress reactions may begin early in human development.

      "title": "Cognitive deficits in Spanish-speaking Mexican children with developmental dyslexia.",
      "content": "Objective: Developmental dyslexia (DD) has been related to deficits in multiple cognitive skills. Phonological processing deficits are the most frequently reported in opaque orthographies, but there are few studies of transparent orthographies, such as Spanish. The aim of this study was to comprehensively explore possible deficiencies in cognitive functions in Spanish-speaking Mexican children with DD, to determine whether these deficits can explain problems with decoding fluency and accuracy, and analyze whether they provide support for some of the explanatory hypotheses of DD. Method: An extensive cognitive assessment was performed with Spanish-speaking readers: 40 children (20 girls) with DD (mean age 9.02 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.49) and 40 children (20 girls) who were typical readers (mean age 9.22 years, <em>SD</em> = 1.45). Results: Our results showed that most of the children with DD presented deficits in multiple cognitive skills, although not all of these skills contributed to reading performance. These cognitive deficits were not equally distributed among all children and there was no cognitive skill in which all participants with DD showed poor performance. Our results demonstrated that recognition of letter orientation, phonological awareness, and rapid automatized naming were significant predictors of reading ability. Conclusion: These findings support the idea that reading is a multifactorial process involving many cognitive skills, and its disruption could arise from different causes. The main findings are discussed in relation to the major explanatory hypotheses of DD. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
