      "title": "Olfactory biopsy analysis of Alzheimer's pathobiology across disease stages",
      "content": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition affecting millions worldwide. Defining early pathobiological events remains challenging, in part due to inaccessibility of neural tissue. Because olfactory neurons are accessible, and olfactory loss is prevalent in AD, we evaluated olfactory brush biopsies from controls, individuals with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker-confirmed AD, and cognitively typical individuals whose positive biomarkers signal a pre-clinical AD stage. We define via single cell RNA-sequencing (n=22 subjects) conserved neuroinflammatory T cell, myeloid, and olfactory neuron changes detectable even in pre-clinical AD subjects. Activated memory T cell states were a hallmark of pre-clinical AD, paralleling CSF T cell phenotypes seen in advanced disease, accompanied by both microglia-like inflammatory programs and olfactory neuron inflammatory injury. Together, our findings establish a novel platform permitting analysis of neural tissue in AD at its earliest stages.",

      "title": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis",
      "content": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is best known as a neuropeptide that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Independent from its activity in the HPT axis, TRH also exerts strong neuroprotective activity against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Although multiple factors have been linked to its neuroprotective action, the cellular mechanism of TRH neuroprotection is still not clear. Here we show that TRH protects hippocampal neurons against glutamate toxicity via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and new protein synthesis. Both adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated TRH transduction and TRH peptide given exogenously over 24 hours period of time inhibit glutamate-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. This effect is not mediated by the decreased intracellular calcium response as TRH treatment (24 hours) has no effect on glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium nor the calpain activity. While TRH treatment (10 minutes) significantly inhibits glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium, no protective effect is observed when TRH is applied 30 minutes before or after glutamate stimulation. Instead, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 but not mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibits the protective effect of TRH. LY294002 also blocks TRH induced AKT activation. In addition, protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide inhibits the protective effect of TRH. Taken together, these results suggest PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and new protein synthesis are involved in the protective effect of TRH against glutamate toxicity, thereby providing mechanistic support for its action in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Multiple patterns of selectivity in superior colliculus control visual search",
      "content": "Visual search is a ubiquitous behavior for many animal species, but efficient search performance requires a relatively complex integration of target guidance and behavioral history signals. In this study, we investigate how the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain area implicated in the control of overt spatial attention, integrates these two control signals in a multi-target search task. Monkeys made sequences of saccades to stimuli presented in a grid while searching for a \"true\" (reward eliciting) target amid color-coded targets and distractors. The efficient performance of this task requires integrating a target guidance signal with a history of previously fixated locations in order to guide search to new potential targets that might offer reward. Theories of systems neuroscience suggest that this multi-factor search behavior might be controlled using either mixed selectivity, dynamic selectivity, or pure selectivity. We find evidence for SC neurons exhibiting each of these patterns and conclude that this brain structure participates in circuits representing target similarity and previously fixated locations, in addition to a circuit responsible for integrating these signals using the mechanisms of dynamic and mixed selectivity. We also introduce a novel time-series partial information decomposition analysis that provides a rich and direct view of how a neuron allocates its representational capacity. These findings support an emerging view of the superior colliculus as much more than a bottom-up priority map, but instead an important site for the flexible cognitive control of visually-guided behavior.",

      "title": "Scalable spike sorting across thousands of neurons by modeling neural dynamics with NeuroSort",
      "content": "Neural circuit research requires resolving the functional coding mechanisms at the single-neuron scale. However, neural signals captured from extracellular recordings are inherently complex, shaped both by electrode properties and the spatially distributed neural population activity across recording sites. These factors introduce strong signal mixing and waveform variation, making it diffcult for existing spike sorting methods to reliably isolate individual neurons from large-scale recodings. To address this, we develop NeuroSort, which fuses spatiotemporal information through a contrastive learning strategy to adaptively model neural dynamics. NeuroSort is a GPU-enabled, highly efficient spike sorting framework, enabling the isolating of up to thousands of neurons. We validated NeuroSort on in vivo extracellular recordings, including Utah array data from rhesus macaques performing motor tasks and Neuropixels 1.0 probe data from a rat during rest. Moreover, in a recording collected by the 1,024-channel Neuroscroll probe, NeuroSort sorted the largest number of well-isolated neurons from different brain areas while achieving a 2-8 times speedup over other methods.Taken together, NeuroSort generalizes across recording conditions, providing an interpretable and scalable paradigm for whole-brain dynamic analysis.",

      "title": "The School Cafeteria Problem: Disrupted Visuospatial Attention During Multisensory Speech-in-Noise Perception in Children with ADHD",
      "content": "BACKGROUND Many children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have difficulty distinguishing speech in crowded scenarios with competing conversations and noise. This can impact learning and community participation. Prior work has implicated audiovisual integration of lip movements with speech sounds as a potential underlying mechanism, but difficulty in accurately deploying spatial attention is an important, often overlooked, factor that may impact the accuracy of speech perception in noisy environments. OBJECTIVE Evaluate patterns of audiovisual integration and allocation of visuospatial attention during speech processing in a multiple-talker scenario among school-age children with ADHD and typically developing children (TD). METHODS We recruited 7-12-year-old children with ADHD to participate in an integrated virtual reality and electrophysiologic (EEG) speech-in-noise perception paradigm. In virtual reality, children were asked to press a button whenever a centrally-located target character spoke a target monosyllabic word, while ignoring any words spoken by two flanking distractor characters. We manipulated 1) audiovisual (AV) content by intermixing trials containing either audio, visual, or multisensory AV representations of the three characters and 2) spatial attention demands by including trials with and without interference from the distracting speakers. We measured AV gain in target detection accuracy. Simultaneously, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) were continuously recorded via a 128-channel electrode array as an index of visuospatial attention allocation to each speaker. To elicit SSVEP, the target and distractor speakers were tagged with different visual frequency oscillations (23hz and 15hz, respectively). EEG signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the corresponding first and second harmonics for those frequency bands was measured over the occipital scalp. RESULTS Children with ADHD showed reduced AV gain relative to TD controls. TD controls also demonstrated more robust SSVEP at 23Hz and 46Hz (target speaker) than at 15Hz (distractor speakers). Compared to TD children, children with ADHD had reduced selective activation in response to the target. As a result, children with ADHD showed more equivalent allocation of visuospatial attention between 23Hz target and 15Hz distractor frequencies. CONCLUSIONS Children with ADHD demonstrate a reduction in the typical perceptual benefit afforded by exposure to multisensory compared to unisensory speech stimuli, accompanied by substantial differences in the allocation of visuospatial attention to the relevant speaker. Thus, dysregulation of selective visuospatial attention may impair their ability to effectively perceive language in noisy settings.",

      "content": "Chronic recording in macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT) revealed a progression of feature selectivity over the duration of the response, with different images evoking strongest responses in different time bins. Neurons responded briskly and transiently to early best images and gave slower and more sustained responses to later best images. Correlations between IT selectivity and deep neural network (DNN) activations in early layers were faster and more transient than correlations with deeper DNN layers, suggesting a hierarchical representation unfolding. Analysis of best images in different time bins showed that early best images were simpler, or made up of fewer parts, than later best images. This simple-to-complex selectivity dynamic is consistent with, but more universal than, previously reported dynamics of global-to-local or category-to-exemplar selectivity. In parallel with the simple-to-complex selectivity progression, the image selectivity and the population activity became sparser during the response, consistent with the hypothesis of a canonical cortical microcircuit that pools inputs and incorporates neighboring-neuron inhibition. We propose that this temporal cascade in IT recapitulates the multiple antecedent stages in the visual hierarchy, which also show a simple-to-complex progression of feature selectivity.",

      "title": "Thalamofrontal synaptic weakening underlies short-term memory deficits from adolescent NMDAR hypofunction",
      "content": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is linked to schizophrenia, but prevailing models centered on reduced number and activity of inhibitory interneurons and the resulting excitation-inhibition (E-I) imbalance do not explain selective cognitive impairments. Here, we show that repeated adolescent NMDAR antagonism produces short-term memory (STM) deficits by weakening thalamofrontal (TF) synaptic transmission. In mice repeatedly exposed to ketamine, STM impairment coincided with reduced release probability and vesicle refilling at mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) synapses, without detectable changes in layer 2/3 to layer 2/3 synaptic release probability, intrinsic excitability, or synaptic ultrastructure. These presynaptic deficits were accompanied by diminished direction-selective population coding in the dmPFC as revealed by decoding analysis and impaired delayed alternation performance in the Y-maze. Chemogenetic strengthening of MD to dmPFC projections restored both neural selectivity and behavior. Our findings identify a circuit-specific presynaptic mechanism linking adolescent NMDAR hypofunction to cognitive dysfunction, challenging interneuron-centric models and establishing TF synapses as a potential therapeutic target in NMDAR-related disorders.",

      "title": "Self-compassion is linked to positive affect and buffers declines in self-esteem in low performers",
      "content": "Successes and failures shape affective experience and self-esteem. Self-compassion has been proposed as a protective factor, allowing individuals to acknowledge both strengths and shortcomings without excessive self-criticism. However, the mechanisms through which self-compassion influences changes in affect and self-esteem remain poorly understood. Here, we experimentally tested whether self-compassion modulates the links between performance feedback, affective experience, and self-esteem. Participants completed an effortful performance task and received trial-by-trial feedback while repeatedly rating their positive affect. Results show that self-compassion buffered against declines in self-esteem among poorly performing individuals, predicted higher overall positive affect throughout the task, and was associated with increased post-task self-esteem. Moreover, performance feedback predicted positive affect, which in turn predicted post-task self-esteem, although these pathways were not moderated by self-compassion. Together, these findings add to the growing evidence for how self-compassion impacts positive affect and self-esteem and may inform treatment strategies for clinical populations characterized by low self-esteem or heightened self-criticism.",

      "title": "Autonomic reflex plasticity associates with time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in a murine model with hyperactive stress circuits",
      "content": "Sudden unexpected death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with Epilepsy. Although SUDEP results from cardiorespiratory arrest, its underlaying mechanisms are poorly understood. Considering the significant association between stress-related disorders and Epilepsy, we hypothesized that stress exaggerates autonomic reflexes critical in cardiorespiratory function and that these exaggerated reflexes increase susceptibility to SUDEP. Experiments were performed using a novel mouse model of SUDEP where chronic hyperactivity of central corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons (Kcc2/Crh) predisposes mice to SUDEP in the weeks following seizure induction based on the ventral intrahippocampal kainate (vIHKA) model of chronic Epilepsy. In our study, the vIHKA model was employed in both wild-type (WT) and Kcc2/Crh mice while they were monitored with EEG and ECG using in vivo telemetry and underwent terminal autonomic reflex testing at time points when mortality peaked and plateaued. A resting tachycardia developed by one week following vIHKA injection but subsided by day 30 in both WT and Kcc2/Crh mice. During spontaneous seizures, Kcc2/Crh mice had more pronounced reflex-like ictal bradycardias compared to WT controls that notably occurred just prior to seizure termination. vIHKA injection promoted time-dependent exaggeration of autonomic reflexes, with Kcc2/Crh mice exhibiting robust autonomic disturbances compared to WT controls, including a pronounced serotonin-mediated Bezold Jarisch reflex. Taken together, our findings indicate that increased autonomic disturbance burden parallels time-dependent SUDEP susceptibility in mice with hyperactive stress circuits.",
