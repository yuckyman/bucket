      "title": "A validated panel of commercial antibodies for reliable detection of FET proteins.",
      "content": "The FET protein family comprises the highly conserved RNA-binding proteins FUS, EWS and TAF15 which are implicated in RNA metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTLD. Despite their structural similarity, reliable detection of individual FET proteins remains challenging due to antibody cross-reactivity and inconsistent localisation patterns reported in the literature. To address this, we systematically evaluated 23 commercially available antibodies for specificity and performance across western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Using single and double shRNA knockdowns in HeLa cells, we confirmed target engagement and identified antibodies which were specific as well as those with significant cross-reactivity. Immunofluorescence in rat primary neurons and HeLa cells showed antibody and cell type dependent variations in nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation; from these, we identified a subset that demonstrated high-quality, region-specific staining in postmortem human brain tissue. Our findings highlight substantial variability in antibody performance and underscore the need for rigorous validation to ensure reproducibility in FET protein research. We present a validated panel of antibodies suitable for diverse applications, providing a critical resource for studies of FET protein biology and pathology.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Exploration of Auditory Sensory-Perceptual Processing in CLN3 Disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)): A High-Density Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) Study.",
      "content": "Background: There is currently limited information about sensory and perceptual abilities across the progression of CLN3 disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis; Batten disease), a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder and a leading cause of childhood neurodegeneration. Clinical symptoms include vision loss, motor impairments, and cognitive challenges, making it difficult to accurately assess neurocognitive and perceptual abilities. Thus, there is a critical need to identify objective biomarkers that can be used to inform disease progression and track treatment response in this population. Methods: This exploratory study investigates longitudinal changes in auditory sensory perceptual processing in a small sample of individuals with genetically confirmed CLN3 disease (N=4; 3 male) compared to a cross-sectional sample of 60 neurotypical (NT) controls using high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We utilized a duration mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm, identical to what has been used in our previous cross-sectional study. We examined the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) of the standard tones across three different stimulus onset asynchrony conditions and examined the N1 and P2 components of the AEP. Results: We found age related differences in the amplitudes of the N1 and P2 components in individuals with CLN3 disease relative to NT controls. These amplitude differences were most notable in CLN3 disease when participants were presented with standard tones that had the slowest presentation rate. Specifically, N1 and P2 amplitudes were more negative than NT controls in childhood and adolescence and as CLN3 disease participants aged, the amplitude of the AEPs was greater than controls. Further, a more positive N1 amplitude during the longest stimulus presentation condition was associated with both reduced verbal intelligence and working memory abilities in CLN3 disease participants. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings parallel recently published work in a mouse model of CLN3 disease that showed both sex- and age-dependent disruptions in central auditory processing. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of auditory EEG measures as a sensitive, objective and translational measure in CLN3 disease that may serve as a potential outcome measure useful in tracking disease progression. Continued work is needed in humans focused on sex-based differences and longitudinal changes of auditory processing in CLN3 disease.",

      "title": "A New Method for Optimal Placement of Tumor Treating Fields Electrodes",
      "content": "Overview: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) provide a non-invasive treatment option for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. While optimization of electrode placement is important to increase treatment efficacy, clinical therapy planning is done using an undisclosed and proprietary software (NovoTAL), which is clinically unvalidated. This study investigates a new computational approach for optimizing TTFields electrode placement and is compared to the current clinical standard. Methods: We developed a new computational pipeline integrating patient-specific anatomical data to optimize electrode configurations in five representative glioblastoma cases with diverse tumor locations and sizes. Two optimization strategies were employed: one maximizing electric field intensity at the tumor, and another enhancing coverage of the adjacent brain while maintaining sufficient tumor intensity. Results were compared to electrode placements generated by NovoTAL. Additional simulations with artificial tumors assessed the effects of tumor size and location. Results: Optimized electrode placements improved electric field intensity in tumors by 18%-34% compared to the clinical standard. Coverage-weighted optimizations provided broader field coverage without significantly compromising tumor intensity. Smaller or surface-adjacent tumors benefited most from optimization, achieving precise targeting and enhanced coverage. Extensive randomized placement analyses highlighted the superior performance of the optimized configurations. Analysis of artificial models showed consistent improvements across varying tumor locations and sizes. Conclusion: Personalized optimization of TTFields electrode placement significantly improves electric field targeting of tumors and adjacent brain regions. This approach outperforms standardized planning software and clinical practices and supports future development of adaptive, automated strategies for individualized TTFields therapy in glioblastoma.",

      "title": "A 4-pole Theory-Based Compensation Method using Multiple Loads for Impedance Spectroscopy of Porcine Brain Tissue",
      "content": "Accurate determination of the electrical properties of brain tissue -conductivity and relative permittivity - is essential for modeling and optimizing neurostimulation and neuroimaging and modulation techniques such as EEG, MEG, TMS, and TES. However, large discrepancies in reported conductivity values highlight the methodological challenges associated with impedance measurements. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of compensation methods in impedance spectroscopy to improve measurement accuracy using a self-developed four-point platinum electrode designed for biological tissue applications. Three compensation algorithms - open-short, open-short-load, and multiple-load - were implemented and compared using an RC parallel test circuit that emulated typical measurement conditions, with load resistances ranging from 250 Ohm to 5000 Ohm. Quantitative error analysis demonstrated that the multiple-load method achieved the lowest normalized root mean square error (3.4%) and superior stability across frequencies from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. The calibrated probe was subsequently applied to post mortem porcine brain tissue, yielding conductivity values of grey matter of 0.109 S/m and white matter of 0.074 S/m. These results are significantly lower than standard simulation parameters of 0.275 S/m, and 0.126 S/m for grey and white matter, respectively. Finite-element simulations revealed that using the measured conductivities increased electric field predictions by 2.1% for TMS and 46% for TES in the maximum electric field magnitude, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that accurate impedance compensation is critical for reliable characterization of brain tissue and for enhancing the precision of neurostimulation modeling in the future.",

      "title": "Silmitasertib, an FDA-designated orphan CK2 Inhibitor, ameliorates neuropathology and motor dysfunction in a Huntington's disease mouse model",
      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that manifests with progressive motor, cognitive, and psychological impairments. HD is caused by a polyQ (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to the misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT protein (mHTT) and the preferential degeneration of the striatum. Previously in our lab, we identified Protein Kinase CK2 as an important kinase involved in the pathophysiology of HD. Specifically, the alpha prime catalytic subunit of CK2 (CK2') is upregulated in HD, and genetic depletion of CK2' in HD mice results in improved motor behavior, decreased mutant Htt aggregation, and improved neuronal function. Silmitasertib (CX-4945) is an FDA designated orphan drug that inhibits CK2. This study aims to investigate whether CX-4945 treatment ameliorates HD pathology. We treated prodromal and late symptomatic HD mice, and used a variety of immunohistochemical, biochemical, physiological and behavioral approaches. We found that CX-4945 presented benefits in the amelioration of HD pathophysiology in both treated groups. Importantly, we found CX-4945 decreased mHtt aggregation, increased DARPP-32 expression and excitatory synapse density, restored homeostatic astrocyte phenotypes and ameliorated neuroinflammation and microgliosis, altogether resulting in improved motor behavior. These results support CX-4945 as a strong candidate for a targeted therapy to treat HD.",

      "title": "Comparing Methods for Mass Univariate Analyses of Human EEG: Empirical Data and Simulations",
      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used method for investigating human brain dynamics. However, EEG analyses are frequently conducted with limited a priori knowledge regarding locations or latencies of meaningful statistical effects. This makes it difficult for researchers to form regions of interest (ROIs), which are then analyzed using traditional statistical models such as analysis of variance. In addition, exploratory studies, or studies interested in determining the exact temporal and spatial extent of a predicted effect may aim to examine many sensor locations and time points, often jointly. To address this, mass univariate analyses have become a valuable complement to ROI-based approaches. These methods attempt to correct for multiple comparisons while mitigating the risk of false positives and false negatives, thus enabling statistical inference in high-dimensional EEG data. Here, we review and evaluate different approaches for delineating spatial and temporal effect boundaries in three different datasets, focusing on within-subjects comparisons. Specifically, we focus on permutation-based approaches and their Bayesian alternatives to address condition differences in i) steady-state evoked responses, ii) event-related potentials, and iii) time-frequency data. Overall, simulation results indicate that cluster-based permutation tests provide a relatively liberal approach to correct for multiple comparisons across domains, with high sensitivity for detecting large effects. In contrast, the permutation-based tmax procedure yields the most conservative method across datasets. Bayesian approaches inherently are continuous in nature and thus strongly depend on the selection of thresholds for when support for a hypothesis is considered meaningful.",
