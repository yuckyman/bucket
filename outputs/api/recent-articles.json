Despite being partially protected by the vertebral column, the spinal cord remains highly vulnerable to trauma, tumors, infections, and degenerative or inflammatory disorders. These conditions can disrupt neural conduction, resulting in severe functional impairments, such as paralysis, motor...",

Current family planning interventions should target women with sensory disabilities by prioritising accessible communication methods (e.g., braille, sign language), disability awareness training for healthcare workers, and integration of reproductive health services into disability support programmes.",

      "content": "High-resolution electronic tactile displays stand to transform haptics for remote machine operation, virtual reality, and digital information access for people who are blind or visually impaired. Yet, increasing the resolution of these displays requires increasing the number of individually addressable actuators while simultaneously reducing their total surface area, power consumption, and weight, challenges most evidently reflected in the dearth of affordable multiline braille displays....",

      "content": "Electronic skins (e-skins) incorporating island architectures represent a promising platform for strain-insensitive tactile sensing by mechanically decoupling sensing units from deformations. However, conventional island designs encounter stress concentration issues caused by inherent modulus mismatches, critically limiting achievable island densities. This limitation forces a stubborn trade-off between strain-insensitivity and sensing resolution. Here, inspired by the entangled elastin networks...",
