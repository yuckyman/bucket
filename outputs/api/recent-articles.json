      "title": "Prenatal maternal stress is associated with increased sensitivity to neuropathic pain and sex-specific epigenetic and transcriptomic dynamics in the prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Prenatal maternal stress (PNS) is a common early-life adversity. PNS has been linked to greater vulnerability to chronic pain in the offspring. PNS results in increased hypersensitivity after Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve, a common rodent model for chronic neuropathic pain. These behavioral effects are accompanied by altered levels of enzymes that regulate DNA methylation in the frontal cortex. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group onto cytosine bases of cytosine-guanine (CpG) sites in the genome, is an epigenetic mechanism by which life experiences can reprogram gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated regions that might contribute to the increased pain sensitivity following nerve injury in adulthood. Prior studies indicate widespread, sex-specific transcriptomic changes and numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the frontal cortex following PNS and nerve injury. Here we performed genome wide DNA methylation and transcriptome-wide RNAseq analysis in the frontal cortex of male and female mice that underwent PNS, CCI or both. Our analysis revealed sex-dependent changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, including in pathways related to neuronal and brain development, axonogenesis and synaptic regulation. The effect of DNA methylation on mRNA expression was tested in a subset of target genes. These studies suggest a role for DNA methylation in embedding increased risk for chronic pain in adulthood associated with early-life adversity.",

      "content": "The human brain's capacity to imagine visual scenes from memory is thought to rely on the medial temporal subsystem of the default mode network (MT-DMN), yet the neural codes supporting this ability remain poorly understood. We combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with vision and language artificial intelligence models to characterize neural codes during autobiographical imagination. Fifty participants imagined reexperiencing twenty natural scenarios while undergoing fMRI, when cued by generic text prompts (e.g., wedding, exercising, driving). Individual scenes were modeled using Stable Diffusion to generate personalized synthetic images from verbal descriptions of the scenarios imagined, collected beforehand. These depictions were then transformed into image-recognition network embeddings. Representational Similarity Analysis revealed that the MT-DMN encoded the participant-specific representational structure of image embeddings, even when controlling for semantic features derived from a large language model. This effect was absent in other networks and during reading without imagination, identifying the MT-DMN as a core substrate for the visual reconstruction of autobiographical experiences.",

      "title": "Distinct developmental trajectories of externally- and internally-generated hippocampal sequences and assemblies",
      "content": "The hippocampus generates cognitive maps through two distinct mechanisms: external representations anchored to environmental landmarks and internal sequences integrating self-referenced information. In adult CA1, these functions segregate radially, with deep cells processing external cues and superficial cells handling internal representations. This anatomical organization suggests that developmental processes constrain the formation of these functionally distinct circuits. However, the developmental timeline for the emergence of these two types of hippocampal representations remains unknown. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice during the third postnatal week, we investigated when internal versus external hippocampal representations emerge. We recorded from deep and superficial CA1 layers while mice ran on treadmills that are bare or enriched with tactile cues, addressing the challenge of tracking cells across sessions. Internal sequences emerge during the mid-fourth postnatal week, following the development of cue-based representations. These sequences initially encode elapsed time before evolving to integrate run distance, arising after rest cell assemblies as spatial coding and functional connectivity networks stabilize. These findings identify the mid fourth postnatal week as a critical developmental milestone marking the establishment of a balanced integration between external landmark-based and internal self-referenced spatial representations. This transition period may constitute a vulnerable developmental window during which disruptions could predispose to disorders characterised by altered cognitive maps.",

      "content": "Protein biomarkers in biofluids are highly sensitive indicators of prodromal cognitive impairment yet remain limited for primary prevention. Lipids, essential to brain structure and function, offer untapped prognostic value. Here, we identify a lipidomic signature in serum from asymptomatic PSEN1-E280A mutation carriers aged 6-40 years, that differentiate carriers from non-carriers with an AUC 80-90%. Similarly, to symptomatic carriers (older 41 years; 93%) and sporadic AD cases (85%), using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Latent profile analysis revealed lipid-based signatures of dementia risk and resilience, shaped by genotype, sex, and APOE isoform, and supported by SIMOA protein biomarkers. Age-dependent dysregulation in sphingolipid and glycolipid metabolism was validated by enzymatic activity (TLC), glial phenotyping (flow cytometry), and gene expression (snRNAseq) in postmortem brain. Ganglioside clearance deficits emerged by age 6-12, followed by proinflammatory shifts from age 13 and p-tau217 elevation by age 20, with greater burden in females and APOE4 carriers. APOE3Ch individuals showed differential salvage pathways of ceramides and gangliosides. These findings position early lipid pathway dysregulation as a biological contributor to Alzheimers pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic target for primary prevention.",
