      "title": "Is critical brain dynamics more prevalent than previously thought?",
      "content": "The hypothesis that the brain operates near criticality has far-reaching implications for brain function and is supported by growing experimental evidence. Observations of scale-invariant brain activity agree with this hypothesis, but what about when brain activity is not scale-invariant? Should we reject the criticality hypothesis When power-laws poorly fit the data or when strong oscillations occur (dominated by a specific time scale)? Here we show several ways that criticality can be hidden from traditional data analytic approaches, leading to false negative conclusions. We use a parsimonious high-dimensional model to demonstrate how neural systems may separate different dynamical modes into different subspaces, simultaneously generating non-critical dynamics, critical oscillations, and scale-invariant avalanches. Our results point to a need for new methods capable of revealing hidden criticality and suggest that criticality could be more prevalent than previously thought, hidden in subspaces not readily revealed by standard data analyses.",

Antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS), a cost-effective intervention recognized for its potential to improve maternal and neonatal health, reduces risks of low birth weight, preterm birth, small for gestational age, and stillbirth while offering a $37 return for every $1 invested.

While near heterophoria shifted towards esophoria, participants' ability to counteract this was also diminished by a reduction in NFV. This suggests that the near heterophoria and fusional reserves of children using 0.05% atropine for myopia control should be monitored closely.",

There is still some debate about the role of immediate sensory experience versus conceptual colour understanding in crossmodal correspondences. In...",

Edible berries of blackcurrant (BC) and its extracted anthocyanins (BCAs) have beneficial effects on human eyes. However, the effect of BCAs on the perception of moving objects and other dynamic visual patterns remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether BCAs improve visual movement perception in aging mice. The aging mice were fed either a standard diet or a standard diet containing BC....",
