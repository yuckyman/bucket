      "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "title": "UAV-based intelligent traffic surveillance using recurrent neural networks and Swin transformer for dynamic environments",
      "content": "IntroductionUrban traffic congestion, environmental degradation, and road safety challenges necessitate intelligent aerial robotic systems capable of real-time adaptive decision-making. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), with their flexible deployment and high vantage point, offer a promising solution for large-scale traffic surveillance in complex urban environments. This study introduces a UAV-based neural framework that addresses challenges such as asymmetric vehicle motion, scale variations, and spatial inconsistencies in aerial imagery.MethodsThe proposed system integrates a multi-stage pipeline encompassing contrast enhancement and region-based clustering to optimize segmentation while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained UAV platforms. Vehicle detection is carried out using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), optimized via a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and mean squared error to improve localization and confidence estimation. Upon detection, the system branches into two neural submodules: (i) a classification stream utilizing SURF and BRISK descriptors integrated with a Swin Transformer backbone for precise vehicle categorization, and (ii) a multi-object tracking stream employing DeepSORT, which fuses motion and appearance features within an affinity matrix for robust trajectory association.ResultsComprehensive evaluation on three benchmark UAV datasets\u2014AU-AIR, UAVDT, and VAID shows consistent and high performance. The model achieved detection precisions of 0.913, 0.930, and 0.920; tracking precisions of 0.901, 0.881, and 0.890; and classification accuracies of 92.14, 92.75, and 91.25%, respectively.DiscussionThese findings highlight the adaptability, robustness, and real-time viability of the proposed architecture in aerial traffic surveillance applications. By effectively integrating detection, classification, and tracking within a unified neural framework, the system contributes significant advancements to intelligent UAV-based traffic monitoring and supports future developments in smart city mobility and decision-making systems.",

      "title": "Electrical synapses mediate visual approach behavior",
      "content": "Detecting salient visual objects and orienting toward them are commonplace tasks for animals, yet the underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. The fruit fly is an ideal model for a comprehensive analysis of feature detection mechanisms given its complete synaptic wiring diagrams, robust behavioral assays, and cell-type-specific gene expression datasets. We previously showed that columnar visual neurons T3 are required for saccadic orientation toward landscape features during flight. Here, we examine how signals downstream of T3 are processed in the central brain. We identify the LC17 type of visual projection neurons as key postsynaptic targets: they receive strong excitatory input from T3, project to premotor brain regions, and are thus positioned to support visual approach. Using in vivo optical physiology and virtual reality behavior, we demonstrate that LC17 neurons are indeed necessary for object tracking during flight. Furthermore, we find that electrical synapses in LC17 are also required for tracking behavior. Accordingly, we show that the innexin Shaking B (shakB) is highly expressed in LC17 dendrites, and genetic perturbations confirm an essential role for gap junctional coupling in this circuit. Our findings reveal mechanisms underlying visual approach, and highlight the interplay between electrical and chemical neurotransmission for rapid object detection and action selection.",

      "title": "Region-specific human brain organoids reveal synaptic and cell state drivers of glioblastoma invasion",
      "content": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly heterogenous and malignant brain tumor, in part because it disrupts normal brain circuits to fuel its own growth and invasion. Thus, there is a need to identify the molecular features of invasive GBM cells and their regulators in the neural microenvironment. To address this in a fully human model, we engrafted patient-derived GBM cells (total n=15 independent samples) from three sources - fresh neurosurgical resections, cell lines, and whole GBM organoids - into human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids patterned to forebrain, midbrain, and spinal cord identities. GBM cells from all sources infiltrated brain organoids within 2 days post-engraftment, reaching maximal invasion by day 14. Across organoids of distinct spatial and maturational milieu, GBM cells showed a consistent reduction in astrocyte-like states and an enrichment in neuron/glia progenitor-like (NPC-like) states. These NPC-like GBM cells expressed neuronal and synaptic machinery, and tumors enriched in this transcriptomic state prior to engraftment achieved greater organoid coverage, suggesting enhanced infiltration and synaptic integration of this GBM cell type. Although GBM cell states converged across organoid types after engraftment, infiltration was greater in the forebrain than spinal cord. This is likely reflective of synaptic input from deep-layer TBR1 excitatory neurons in the forebrain, as demonstrated by a combination of rabies-based monosynaptic tracing and single-cell transcriptomics. In contrast, inhibitory neurons were the predominant synaptic partners of GBM in the spinal cord. Together, this fully human model of the neural-GBM connectome reveals how neuron-like GBM states and regionally distinct synaptic inputs cooperatively shape tumor invasion.",

      "title": "Functional and Structural Plasticity in Cocaine-Seeking Ensembles of the Nucleus Accumbens Core",
      "content": "Relapse vulnerability in substance use disorder (SUD) is primarily driven by cue-induced activation of neurons within the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), among other contributing factors. Neuronal ensembles within the NAcore, defined here as selectively co-activated neurons during specific behavioral experiences, are essential during cocaine sensitization and recall. While transient synaptic plasticity (t-SP) has been widely observed in general neuronal populations within the NAcore during reinstatement, its ensemble-specific dynamics remain unclear. Here, we used c-Fos-TRAP2-based tagging to identify cocaine-seeking ensembles in mice following cocaine intravenous self-administration, extinction, and cue-induced reinstatement. Structural spine plasticity was assessed via confocal microscopy, and functional changes were measured using whole-cell electrophysiology across multiple reinstatement time points. Ensemble neurons exhibited enhanced dendritic spine head diameter (dh) and AMPA/NMDA (A/N) ratios following cue exposure, consistent with t-SP. Notably, spine classification revealed a reduction in mature spines during reinstatement, suggesting morphological remodeling rather than new spine formation in both ensemble and non-ensemble cells. Non-ensemble neurons exhibited classical functional transient synaptic plasticity, characterized by increased A/N ratios but no significant changes in dh. To begin assessing if presynaptic vesicle release impacts t-SP, paired-pulse ratio analysis indicated no differences in population or time point. Importantly, ensemble neurons displayed elevated A/N ratio following cocaine exposure, suggesting prior silent synapse maturation. These findings demonstrate that t-SP is not uniformly distributed across NAcore neurons but differs significantly between ensemble and non-ensemble neurons. By linking ensemble identity to both structural and functional plasticity, this study refines our understanding of cue-induced relapse mechanisms.",

      "title": "Iron Deficiency Impairs Mitochondrial Energetics and Early Axonal Growth and Branching in Developing Hippocampal Neurons",
      "content": "Each stage of neuronal development (i.e., proliferation, differentiation, migration, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation) requires functional and highly coordinated metabolic activity to ultimately ensure proper sculpting of complex neural networks. Energy deficits underlie many neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases implicating mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target. Iron is necessary for neuronal energy output through its direct role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Iron deficiency (ID) reduces mitochondrial respiratory and energy capacity in developing hippocampal neurons, causing permanently simplified dendritic arbors and impaired learning and memory. However, the effect of ID on early axonogenesis has not been explored. We used an embryonic mixed-sex primary mouse hippocampal neuron culture model of developmental ID to evaluate mitochondrial respiration and dynamics and effects on axonal morphology. At 7 days in vitro (DIV), ID impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity and stunted growth of both the primary axon and branches, without affecting branch number. Mitochondrial motility was not altered by ID, suggesting that mitochondrial energy production --- not trafficking --- underlie the axon morphological deficits. These findings provide the first link between iron-dependent neuronal energy production and early axon structural development and emphasize the importance of maintaining sufficient iron during gestation to prevent the negative consequences of ID on brain health across the lifespan.",

These structures detect sustained pressure, velocity, and vibrations, thereby facilitating nuanced environmental interactions. It is not known whether the ancestral anamniotic somatosensory system, typically lacking such structures, provides comparable tactile discrimination. Here, we investigate the...",

While the tactile sensibility of the hand has been extensively characterized, much less is known about touch on other parts of the body. Despite the important role of the breast in lactation as well as in affective and sexual touch, relatively little is known about its sensory properties. To fill this gap, we investigated the spatial acuity of...",
