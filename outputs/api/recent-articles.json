      "content": "Edge AI implements neural networks directly in electronic circuits, using either deep neural networks (DNNs) or neuromorphic spiking neural networks (SNNs). DNNs offer high accuracy and easy-to-use tools but are computationally intensive and consume significant power. SNNs utilize bio-inspired, event-driven architectures that can be significantly more energy-efficient, but they rely on less mature training tools. This review surveys digital and analog edge-AI implementations, outlining device architectures, neuron models, and trade-offs in energy (J/OP), area (\u03bcm2/OP), and integration technology.",

      "title": "Systematic review of experimental studies in humans on transcranial temporal interference stimulation",
      "content": "Transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS) has recently emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation method aimed at reaching deeper brain regions than conventional techniques. However, many questions about its effects remain, requiring further experimental studies. This review consolidates the experimental literature on tTIS\u2019s effects in the human brain, clarifies existing evidence, identifies knowledge gaps, and proposes future research directions to evaluate its potential. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies published up to 27 January 2025. Eligible studies applied tTIS to the human brain and examined its effects on neural, behavioral, and clinical outcomes. Of 127 publications screened, 18 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were analyzed for design, stimulation target, parameters, control conditions, and outcome measures. Included studies exhibited low bias or minor concerns using the Cochrane RoB2 and ROBINS-I tools. Ten studies targeted cortical regions (motor, occipito-parietal, fronto-parietal), and eight probed subcortical sites (striatum, hippocampus, globus pallidus, caudate). Motor-cortex tTIS enhanced motor-network connectivity, though the effect was similar to that of transcranial direct current stimulation. Beta-band stimulation envelopes (20\u2009Hz) promoted learning-related plasticity, while gamma-band envelopes (70\u2009Hz) yielded immediate performance improvements. Occipito-parietal tTIS did not modulate alpha power. Preliminary deep-target findings are promising: 5 Hz hippocampal tTIS improved episodic recall, 100\u2009Hz striatal tTIS enhanced motor learning in older adults, and 100\u2009Hz hippocampal-entorhinal tTIS aided spatial navigation. Two fMRI studies confirmed network-specific modulation, although one raised concerns about using a fixed montage between individuals. Clinical evidence remains limited, with two Parkinson\u2019s pilots and one epilepsy study showing short-term benefits. Overall, tTIS shows potential to modulate human brain activity and behavior. However, current evidence is preliminary and predominantly focused on cortical rather than deep targets. Larger, well-controlled studies are needed to reliably determine whether tTIS can effectively engage subcortical structures and provide meaningful clinical benefits.",

      "content": "Objective. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) scan contains a muscle\u2019s detailed stimulus-activation information and thereby can be used for motor unit number estimation (MUNE). Due to the challenges in accurately obtaining the motor unit numbers from experimental CMAP scans, most existing MUNE methods rely on data fitting, which is time-consuming and requires manual operations. This study explored the feasibility of a neural network-based MUNE approach and proposes an end-to-end model for rapid estimation. Approach. We developed NNEstimation, a novel supervised learning framework based on a convolutional neural network, to estimate motor unit numbers from both synthetic and experimental CMAP scans. A probabilistic model with varied parameters was used to generate CMAP scans with diverse characteristics for neural network training. NNEstimation trained on synthetic data was directly tested on both synthetic and experimental data. Main results. Evaluations on synthetic CMAP scans demonstrate that NNEstimation achieves lower estimation error and shorter execution time than the conventional data fitting method, MScanFit. The accuracy of NNEstimation is influenced by motor unit numbers of CMAP scans and remains unaffected by noise levels, recorded amplitudes, or motor unit activation thresholds. Moreover, NNEstimation\u2019s estimates on experimental data are highly consistent with those of MScanFit. Significance. Although trained solely on synthetic CMAP scans, NNEstimation achieves estimation results comparable to those of the traditional algorithm on experimental data while significantly reducing execution time, demonstrating its potential for practical MUNE applications.",

      "title": "Feature fusion based on global-local weighted attention model for automatic epileptic seizure detection",
      "content": "Objective. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, which present significant challenges in both diagnosis and treatment. Despite advances in seizure detection, existing methods often struggle with accurately capturing the complex and dynamic interactions between temporal, spatial, and spectral features of electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This leads to limitations in the detection accuracy and generalization across different datasets. Approach. To address these challenges, we propose global-local weighted attention (GLWA) model, which integrates temporal, spatial, and spectral features through a local-global attention mechanism. At the same time, GLWA effectively balances both global and local features, capturing comprehensive information from EEG signals to enhance seizure detection accuracy. Main results. Our proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 98.82% and 98.89% on the CHB-MIT and Siena datasets, respectively. These results demonstrate the model\u2019s capability to effectively integrate these features, resulting in improved detection performance. Significance. Furthermore, we visualize the model\u2019s decision-making process to gain insights into the attention distribution across different brain regions and spectraluency bands, further emphasizing GLWA\u2019s potential in seizure detection. This work demonstrates the model\u2019s superior performance and interpretability, providing a robust approach for accurate and generalizable identification of seizures.",

      "title": "From zero- to few-shot: deep temporal learning of wrist EMG enables scalable cross-user gesture recognition",
      "content": "Objective. Wrist electromyography (EMG) is emerging as an enticing wearable input modality for human\u2013machine interaction. Traditionally recorded from the forearm for use in transradial prostheses, wrist-based EMG sensors are now being integrated into devices such as watches and wristbands for hand gesture recognition (HGR). Consumer familiarity with wrist-worn devices makes wrist EMG a compelling option, but the need for individualized user calibration remains a challenge. Approach. This study therefore evaluated various cross-user models to reduce the calibration burden and compared wrist- and forearm-based models. Eight different machine learning architectures were evaluated across 33 users, using varying amounts of data from the end user. Main results. A temporal convolutional network-bidirectional long short-term memory architecture, applied for the first time to EMG classification, was found to significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) outperform other tested machine learning architectures. An inter-day feature set combined with Z-score normalization achieved the best performance when classifying five gestures (plus a rest class) using either wrist or forearm EMG. Consistent with other recent results, wrist EMG consistently outperformed forearm EMG in all analyses, including within- and across-user comparisons (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In cross-user models, wrist EMG demonstrated a zero-shot performance of 78.2%, compared to 71.6% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Introducing one calibration repetition from the end user increased one-shot performance of wrist EMG to 91.6%, compared to 86.9% for forearm EMG (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Adding further training repetitions boosted wrist EMG performance to 98.3%, compared to 97.4% for forearm EMG. Significance. These findings provide new evidence supporting the viability of wrist EMG for cross-user HGR models that generalize to new users with minimal calibration, suggesting promising potential for its broader adoption in wearable devices.",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

These are largely asymptomatic and subtle findings that are often missed. They require an early consult to ophthalmology for appropriate management. The major limitations in this study are that it is a single-center, cross-sectional study design that has a low number of patients, lacks a healthy...",
