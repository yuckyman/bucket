      "title": "Real-time distance monitoring in magnetomyography",
      "content": "Objective. Magnetomyography (MMG) using optically pumped magnetometers (OPM) offers a contactless, non-invasive approach to assess muscle activity. However, fluctuations in the sensor-to-source distance during MMG recordings pose a significant challenge to accurate signal interpretation since amplitude decays with distance. No established method exists for MMG to continuously monitor sensor-to-source distance changes in real-time. Approach. This study presents a new non-magnetic, cost-effective solution using a digital fiber optic sensor to continuously measure the distance between an OPM and the subject\u2019s skin. Following sensor calibration, distance measurements were recorded during an isometric muscle fatigue task in five healthy participants to assess whether MMG amplitude changes were due to physiological effects or variations in sensor-to-source distance. Alongside OPM-MMG and distance tracking, electromyography (EMG), the neurophysiological gold standard, was simultaneously recorded. Main results. We found significant changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue that were not merely explained by changes in sensor-to-source distance. Furthermore, we found substantial correlations between OPM-MMG and EMG that were strongest for small sensor-to-source distance (r = 0.91). Significance. Fiber optic sensors offer non-magnetic, precise, real-time monitoring of the distance between the OPM and the skin, making it ideal for MMG applications to account for distance-related variability during measurements. Our results suggest that changes in MMG-RMS and MMG-MDF during muscle fatigue reflect genuine physiological effects rather than distance confounds.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey <a href=\"/r/Python\">r/Python</a>,</p> <p>I come from a data science background, I wanted a project to learn better software engineering practices. After days of coding and debugging, I\u2019m happy with <code>whai</code>, a fast terminal assistant built in Python.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>whai is a CLI assistant you call on-demand when you're stuck in your terminal. You can ask it why a command failed or how to do something (<code>whai speed up this video</code>). It reads your recent terminal activity for context, suggests a command, explains it, and waits for your approval.</p> <h1>Why It\u2019s Different</h1> <p>Most AI terminal tools I tried didn't suit me: they either take over your entire shell (forcing you into a REPL) or run commands without supervision.</p> <p><code>whai</code> takes a different approach. It works inside your native shell, never interrupts you, and never runs a command without your explicit approval. The goal is to act as a helpful expert you can ask for help and learn from.</p> <h1>My Learning Experience</h1> <p>This was my first time building a distributable Python app, and the journey was a change from my typical data science workflow. And I got to leverage and adopt some new packages.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tooling:</strong> I fell in love with <code>uv</code> for its speed (bye <code>conda</code>) and extensive <code>pytest</code> testing. Combining this with with <code>nox</code> to automate testing across multiple Python versions feels like magic.</li> <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Setting up an automated CI/CD using tags pipeline is so nice to have. Having it use <code>uv</code>, <code>pytest</code> and <code>nox</code> really simplified publishing and gave me peace of mind.</li> </ul> <p>If you spend a lot of time in the terminal, you can check it out here:</p> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/gael-vanderlee/whai\">https://github.com/gael-vanderlee/whai</a></p> <p>You can install it with <code>uv tool install whai</code> (or <code>pipx</code> or <code>pip</code>) or try it without installing using <code>uvx whai &quot;your question&quot;</code>.</p> <p>Would love any feedback, ideas, or bug reports.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gueleric\"> /u/Gueleric </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxz29u/i_took_a_break_from_data_science_to_build_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1oxz29u/i_took_a_break_from_data_science_to_build_my/\">[comments]</a></span>",
