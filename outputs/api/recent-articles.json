      "content": "IntroductionYoung women are increasingly affected by stroke and often experience persistent executive function deficits that impact global functioning. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a strategy-based cognitive training program (Strategic Memory Advanced Reasoning Training) to improve executive function and related outcomes in young women with stroke.MethodsEight women with chronic-stage stroke (age: M = 38.75 years; SD = \u00b1 8.78) and eight age- and education-matched controls (age: M = 35.75 years; SD \u00b1 7.71) completed 10 sessions of SMART over 5 weeks, with pre- and post- training assessments. Outcomes included measures of executive function (subtests of the BrainHealth Index), daily living skills (Cognitive Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, Daily Living Questionnaire, and Community Integration Questionnaire), and psychosocial functioning (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21), as well as feasibility/goodness of fit of the program (Acceptability of Intervention Measure, Intervention Appropriateness Measure, and Feasibility of Intervention Measure).ResultsFollowing SMART, participants with stroke demonstrated improvements in aspects of executive function (including abstraction, strategic memory, and fluency of ideas), cognitive self-efficacy, and stress. Control participants also demonstrated gains, particularly in cognitive self-efficacy. Feasibility was rated highly by participants with stroke.DiscussionFindings support SMART as a promising intervention for enhancing cognitive and functional outcomes in young women with stroke, warranting further large-scale investigation.",

      "content": "Within the framework of a \u201cneurofilmological\u201d approach \u2013 which integrates film studies, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience \u2013 the present study explored how cinematographic editing influences the viewer\u2019s perception of time. Previous behavioral research has shown that editing density affects temporal judgments. To investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship, we examined the role of motor system activity, specifically the supplementary motor area (SMA), in time perception when individuals are exposed to moving images with different cinematographic editing styles. Forty-eight university students were assigned to one of three tDCS conditions (anodal, cathodal, or sham). They viewed nine silent video clips with different editing styles (master shot, slow-paced, fast-paced) that were specifically created for research. The participants rated perceived duration, time passage, action speed, and emotional engagement, while tDCS was applied for 20 min targeting the SMA. The results revealed that SMA excitability modulation affected duration estimates, time passage, and action speed judgments by interacting with the editing style of the clips. These findings highlight the importance of the SMA in modulating time perception during film viewing. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms that shape the viewer\u2019s perception of film time as an integral part of experiencing movement in cinema.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "content": "IntroductionBrain tumors present a significant threat to human health, demanding accurate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Traditional manual analysis of medical imaging data is inefficient and prone to errors, especially considering the heterogeneous morphological characteristics of tumors. Therefore, to overcome these limitations, we propose MAUNet, a novel 3D brain tumor segmentation model based on U-Net.MethodsMAUNet incorporates a Spatial Convolution (SConv) module, a Contextual Feature Calibration (CFC) module, and a gating mechanism to address these challenges. First, the SConv module employs a Spatial Multi-Dimensional Weighted Attention (SMWA) mechanism to enhance feature representation across channel, height, width, and depth. Second, the CFC module constructs cascaded pyramid pooling layers to extract hierarchical contextual patterns, dynamically calibrating pixelcontext relationships by calculating feature similarities. Finally, to optimize feature fusion efficiency, a gating mechanism refines feature fusion in skip connections, emphasizing critical features while suppressing irrelevant ones.ResultsExtensive experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MAUNet, achieving average Dice scores of 84.5 and 83.8%, respectively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed module, highlighting their contributions to improved segmentation accuracy. Our work provides a robust and efficient solution for automated brain tumor segmentation, offering significant potential for clinical applications.",

Therefore, this study investigated how psychological distance (friends vs. stranger pairs) and topic type (shared vs. exclusive experiences) modulate inter-brain synchronization (IBS) during emotional communication, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The results showed that: (1) shared story (vs. exclusive story) elicited higher levels of emotion perception, both for self and other (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), and friends (vs. stranger) perceived their friends\u2019 negative emotions more strongly (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). (2) Higher IBS was observed at the right superior frontal gyrus (rSFG; BA 10) when shared story in friend than shared story in stranger (p_FWE < 0.05). The results indicate that with the deepening of friendships, the overlap between the two parties increases, resulting in higher emotional resonance when sharing common experiences. These findings provide brain imaging evidence supporting the involvement of emotion perception during communication.",

      "title": "Research on the effect of TMS on insomnia patients: EEG changes and prognostic modeling",
      "content": "ObjectiveInsomnia (ID) is the most common clinical disorder afflicting people of all ages, races, and social classes. This study was to explore changes in the brain\u2019s nervous system of insomnia patients after TMS treatment and construct a prognostic prediction model.MethodThis study involved collecting EEG data of 15 patients before and after treatment, extracting features (approximate entropy, sample entropy, alignment entropy, power spectral density, median, mean, kurtosis, and skewness), and building an SVR model.ResultsFifteen subjects (8 females, 7 males, mean age 42\u202fyears) received 7\u202fdays of TMS on the right prefrontal lobe. Five eigenvalues were used to analyze EEG data in 5 frequency bands. Statistically significant indicator eigenvalues (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Paired t-test showed significant differences in PSQI and ISI total scores before and after TMS treatment, indicating its therapeutic effect. Correlation coefficients between 40 indicators and scale differences were calculated, and significant characteristic values were further analyzed. SVR models for predicting ISI and PSQI scale pre-post differences were constructed. Both had predictive ability.ConclusionThis work proposes the first SVR model leveraging pre-treatment EEG features to predict TMS therapeutic outcomes for insomnia. TMS treatment can change brain waves, and the model is expected to be applied clinically, though with limitations such as small sample size and insufficiently detailed brain region division.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
