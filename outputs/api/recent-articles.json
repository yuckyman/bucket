      "title": "Cryo-EM structure of pro-aggregant P301L/S320F double-mutant tau filaments formed in mouse brains following peripheral AAV delivery",
      "content": "Tauopathies are characterized by the accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau filaments, with disease-specific folds revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Here, we delivered a recombinant human tau carrying the P301L/S320F double mutation into AppNL-G-F/MAPT double knock-in mice using a blood-brain-barrier-permeable AAV (AAV-PHP.eB), enabling rapid induction of tau aggregation in vivo. The mutant tau was systemically administered via retro-orbital injection, providing a minimally invasive approach for widespread neuronal transduction. Phosphorylated tau aggregation, as well as seeding activity, were observed without the need for exogenous seeds. Our cryo-EM analysis resolved a novel filament fold incorporating residues 279-329, in which the P301L and S320F mutations introduced stabilizing interactions that reinforced filament assembly. This conformation was distinct from previously reported folds, including Alzheimer and Pick tau filaments. Moreover, the filaments adopted a more compact architecture than those observed in patient-derived samples or other model mice. This finding demonstrates that P301L/S320F double-mutant tau adopts a structurally unique, highly aggregation-prone fold, and that this system provides a rapid platform for modeling tau filament formation.",

      "title": "Time-frequency embedding with contrastive pre-training allows sub-second seizure detection",
      "content": "Rapid and accurate detection of electrographic seizures is critical for both clinical diagnosis and neuroscience research. Although seizure identification is commonly performed in the time domain, analysis in the time-frequency domain provides a more comprehensive representation of seizure characteristics. In this study, we present a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) that incorporates a trainable continuous wavelet transform (CWT) layer, enabling adaptive time-frequency feature learning directly from raw EEG. To address common data challenges, we augment the 3D CNN for pre-training with contrastive learning, comparing contrastive predictive coding (CPC) against bidirectional contrastive learning (BiCL). On single-channel and multi-channel data, the standard 3D CNN outperformed both a 2D CNN with pre-computed CWT and a 1D CNN that processes raw signals, achieving >95% accuracy down to 0.5-second segments. Compared to the standard 3D CNN, the 3D CNN with BiCL pre-training showed superior performance in both low-data and class imbalance scenarios. Further experiments involving band-pass filtering and temporal shuffling revealed that classification is driven primarily by low-frequency patterns and statistical features rather than temporal dependencies. The proposed framework also maintained >90% accuracy with moderate noise and downsampling applied to inputs, as well as when cross-subject generalization was evaluated using held-out subjects. We show that a 3D CNN with a trainable CWT layer and BiCL pre-training enables accurate sub-second seizure detection and effectively mitigates data limitations common in clinical settings. This work demonstrates that time-frequency embedding within CNNs, augmented by self-supervised pre-training, offers a promising path toward architectures for sub-second seizure detection in the presence of practical limitations of real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Reduced GABAB receptor activation and post activation depression of proprioceptive afferents after spinal cord injury.",
      "content": "Despite a long history of studying presynaptic inhibition of the Ia afferent synapse that produces the monosynaptic EPSP on motoneurons, recent evidence has upset the conventional idea that GABAA receptors mediate this inhibition and instead suggests that there are mainly GABAB receptors at this synapse. However, without targeted access to the GABAergic neurons that activate these receptors, quantifying their functional contribution to presynaptic inhibition has proven difficult. We demonstrate here that focal optogenetic activation of terminals of a subpopulation of GAD2+ GABAergic neurons that exclusively project ventrally to Ia afferent synapses produce long-lasting presynaptic inhibition that is entirely mediated by GABAB receptors and simultaneously produces a characteristic brief GABAA receptor-mediated IPSP on the motoneurons. These ventral GAD2 neurons are recurrently activated by Ia afferents, contributing to post-activation depression with repeated afferent reflex testing, with a similar long time-course to post-activation depression of the H-reflex induced in humans from either repetitive activation of the same Ia afferents or from antagonist nerve conditioning. In contrast, focal activation of dorsally projecting GAD2 neurons does not directly cause presynaptic inhibition or postsynaptic IPSPs but does produce primary afferent depolarization. Following chronic spinal cord injury (SCI), the expression of GABAB receptors on the Ia terminal is halved, and in mice and humans, is associated with a similar decrease of GABAB receptor-mediated post-activation depression of Ia-EPSPs transmission, which is reversed by the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen. In summary, GABAB receptors mediate presynaptic inhibition, but are down regulated with SCI, contributing to reflex hyperexcitability associated with spasticity.",

      "title": "Microstate Dynamics of Focused Attention Meditation",
      "content": "Focused-attention meditation provides a tractable model for examining how large-scale brain dynamics support attention and self-regulation. Using high-density EEG microstate analysis, we investigated how focused-attention meditation on the breath (Anapanasati) modulates intrinsic brain activity in 22 experienced practitioners, compared with baseline rest and deliberate mental imagery. Five canonical microstate classes (A-E) were identified. Meditation produced a robust reduction of Microstate C across coverage, duration, and occurrence, accompanied by increased presence of Microstates D and E (all Microstate x Condition interactions p < 0.0001). Source localization revealed that Microstate C was generated primarily in medial and lateral temporal regions including the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, whereas Microstate D involved posterior midline regions including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, and Microstate E engaged frontoparietal and orbitolimbic networks. Together, these results indicate that focused-attention meditation reorganizes the temporal architecture of large-scale brain dynamics by downregulating microstate patterns associated with self-referential and memory-based processing while enhancing neural states supporting attentional stability and internal monitoring.",

      "title": "Structural Brain Indicators of Cognitive Performance in Middle and Late Adulthood: The Human Connectome Project in Aging/Aging Adult Brain Connectome Cohort",
      "content": "Introduction: Significant effort has been put towards mapping patterns of atrophy in the cerebral cortex that are related to pathological aging, including the characteristic patterns of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, brain structural patterns that support preserved or even exceptional cognition throughout the adult age-span and especially in later life are much less known. It is possible that superior cognitive performance in late life is supported by a preservation of brain structures vulnerable to typical aging. Alternatively, elevated performance could be related to preservation of brain regions vulnerable to age-associated pathology. Examination of individuals that exhibit superior cognition throughout the adult lifespan may provide unique insights into neural mechanisms that support cognitive resilience in late life. Methods: We examined cross-sectional associations between cortical brain structure and cognitive performance across three stages of adulthood: midlife (36-59), young-old (60-79), and older adults (80+) in typically aging individuals enrolled as part of the Human Connectome Project Lifespan-Aging (HCP-A)/Aging Adult Brain Connectome (AABC) studies. Participants were considered generally healthy and excluded for significant and/or atypical health conditions for their demographic category, including a clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia. Domain-specific cognitive factor scores representing memory, fluid intelligence, and crystalized intelligence were sex-stratified and residualized relative to age, and participants were classified as high, middle, or low performers based on their unique performance relative to the study sample. Results: In the full sample, high performers demonstrated greater cortical thickness in regions of somatomotor, visual, and auditory cortices, as well as cortical areas in the frontal, parietal, and insular cortices (e.g., 5m, LIPv, MBelt). We also found associations between medial temporal and cingulate cortical thickness and cognitive performance, but only for select analyses. Group differences in cortical thickness were greatest when contrasting high and low performers for fluid intelligence compared to the other cognitive factors and were most prominent in the midlife participants compared to the other age strata. These group differences were primarily driven by reduced cortical thickness in the low performing individuals in the younger age bins relative to the 'typically' performing sample. Effects were rather limited when contrasting high and low performers in the 80+ age group. The cortical areas of high statistical significance appeared to show a cross-sectional convergence effect, such that the differences in cortical thickness between high vs. low cognitive performance groups diminished with increasing age. Despite lower statistical power, effect sizes were greatest when contrasting individuals at the extremes of performance (e.g., top 10% vs. bottom 10% performers). These effects were robust to subsample replications using longitudinally defined cognitive classifications. Discussion: Elevated cognitive performance was cross-sectionally associated with increased regional cortical thickness and effects were most prominent in mid-life compared to later ages. Notably, contrary to brain regions that may be expected to support such high-order cognitive performance, a significant portion of primary sensory, motor, and insular cortical areas exhibited group differences between the high- and low-performing groups in this relatively younger age group. Group differences were due to lower thickness in these regions in the low performing group relative to the typical performers. In contrast to the younger portion of the sample, regions typically considered vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease (i.e., regions in the medial temporal lobe) were only infrequently implicated. These results suggest that specific patterns of cortical brain structural integrity including preserved thickness of primary motor and sensory cortical regions may be a necessary but not sufficient mechanism supporting superior cognitive abilities in earlier adulthood, while alternate neural mechanisms may support cognitive resilience later in life. These results must be interpreted with caution given the cross-sectional nature of this study. Cognitive capacity can only be estimated from a single timepoint, and several factors contribute to inter-individual variation that will not be accounted for in the models applied here. Longitudinal assessment of cognitive resilience in the HCP-A/AABC cohort will be performed in future work.",

      "title": "Clonazepam activates the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) ion channel",
      "content": "Benzodiazepines represent a major class of drugs prescribed as treatments for anxiety, insomnia and seizures. They act by engaging GABAA receptors in the central nervous system to depress neuronal excitability. Here, the polypharmacology of benzodiazepines was explored by studying their engagement of human TRP channels revealing clonazepam acts as a robust and selective activator of the TRPM8 ion channel. Clonazepam-evoked Ca2+ signals were observed in cells expressing human TRPM8 channels, and in mouse trigeminal neurons. These responses were completely blocked by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TRPM8 function. This discovery likely explains why clonazepam is an effective treatment for the painful oral condition known as burning mouth disorder, where local activation of TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons mitigates the painful symptoms of this disease.",

      "title": "A HISTORY OF ADOLESCENT OXYCODONE SELF-ADMINISTRATION: NEURAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING NEUROCOGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS",
      "content": "Maturation of the prefrontal cortex and higher-order cognitive processes is ongoing through adolescence and young adulthood; developmental periods associated with the nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Initiation of oxycodone (OXY) self-administration during adolescence induces long-term dose-dependent impairments in neurobehavioral and neurocognitive development. To date, however, the neural mechanisms underlying neurocognitive impairments induced by adolescent prescription opioid use disorder (APOUD) have not been systematically evaluated. A DiOlistic labeling technique, in concert with sophisticated neuronal reconstruction software, revealed a prominent sex- and dose-dependent population shift in the morphological parameters of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of rodents with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to their control counterparts. Similarly, the biochemical mechanisms underlying dendritic spine dysmorphology, which were investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were dependent upon biological sex. In male rodents, a dose-dependent decrease in mRNA expression of GRIN1, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, was observed in animals with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration relative to controls. In contrast, female rats with a history of adolescent OXY self-administration exhibited increased mRNA expression of cdk5, a protein kinase involved in the regulation of pre- and post-synaptic function; a transcriptional alteration that may result from excessive glutamate accumulation. Fundamentally, transcriptional dysregulation and dendritic spine dysmorphology mechanistically underlie, at least partly, APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Collectively, results support that sex-dependent glutamatergic dysregulation may underlie dendritic spine dysmorphology in the ACC resulting in APOUD-induced neurocognitive impairments. Glutamatergic dysregulation, therefore, may afford a key target for the development of novel therapeutics.",

      "title": "Signal space beamforming for gain- and geometry-independent interference suppression in wearable MEG",
      "content": "Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) for wearable magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer substantial flexibility compared to cryogenic MEG, but they also introduce new challenges related to environmental noise and movement artefacts. State-of-the-art denoising techniques such as signal space separation require not only dense OPM arrays but also the fine calibration of sensor gain and geometry. This may complicate their use in complex experimental situations involving uncooperative patients or subjects such as newborns or fetuses, where OPM positioning may be unstable or plain unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce signal space beamforming (SSB), a version of beamforming applied to sensor signals and designed to suppress interferences independently of sensor gain and geometry. We show that SSB operates via a trade-off between noise suppression and neural signal preservation that is controlled by a single soft-threshold parameter, which we calibrated using phantom measurements. We then validated the effectiveness of SSB across several datasets. Using interictal OPM-MEG recordings in epileptic patients, SSB successfully cleaned signals while preserving epileptiform discharges. Moving onto cutting-edge early neurodevelopmental OPM-MEG recordings, SSB allowed to recover auditory evoked responses in newborns and fetuses similar to previous findings but with more streamlined preprocessing and higher response amplitude in the case of the fetal data. We contend that SSB provides a pragmatic solution to exploit OPM-MEG data recorded in challenging conditions where geometry-dependent methods cannot be used, opening new frontiers for pioneering clinical and fundamental applications of the OPM technology.",

      "title": "Rendering Affective Touch With an Array of Pneumatic Unit Cell Actuators",
      "content": "Rendering affective touch through haptic interfaces has gathered significant interest due to its ability to elicit emotional responses. Among various forms of affective touch, this study focuses on stroke stimuli. An illusory stroke stimulus is rendered using eight discrete Pneumatic Unit Cell (PUC) actuators on the left forearm. The study systematically investigates how rendering parameters\u2014including the traveling speed of the illusory stroke, the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of consecutive indentations, and indentation pressure\u2014affect the perceived pleasantness and continuity of the stimulus. Results reveal that higher speeds significantly improved both pleasantness and continuity, with speed emerging as the most influential factor. In contrast, SOA has no significant effect on either perceived pleasantness or continuity. Indentation pressure shows a moderate impact on pleasantness, with high pressures reducing pleasantness but having no significant effect on continuity. Additionally, a positive correlation is observed between perceived pleasantness and continuity, underscoring the relevance of the continuity illusion created by sequential indentations with discrete actuators in evoking pleasant sensations. These findings demonstrate the potential of PUC actuators for creating affective touch stimuli and provide preliminary insights into the influence of rendering parameters on affective touch in human-machine and human-robot interactions.",

      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

      "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

      "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
      "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

      "content": "Early neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease emerge before cognitive decline, yet their synaptic basis remains poorly defined. Here we identify an early, cell-type-specific disruption of synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens during pre-plaque stages of disease. In APP/PS1 mice, intracellular amyloid-beta accumulation is associated with a selective loss of mGluR1/5-dependent long-term depression in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons, despite comparable intracellular amyloid-beta levels across neuronal subtypes. This impairment is accompanied by aberrant postsynaptic remodeling characterized by functional accumulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and increased excitatory drive. These synaptic alterations coincide with reduced dopamine-dependent signaling and selective changes in reward-related behavior, including altered hedonic consumption. Together, these findings identify an early vulnerability of the mesolimbic reward system and suggest that non-cognitive manifestations of Alzheimer's disease arise from circuit-level imbalance before plaque deposition.",

      "title": "Eye movements reveal the intuitive understanding of materials and their behavior",
      "content": "Does a metal ball sink or float when dropped into water? Answering this intuitively simple question relies on our understanding of materials and their physics. Knowing materials helps us to recognize objects, estimate their properties, and predict how they will behave when interacting with other objects or materials. This leads to expectations about material behaviors already in young infants, for example, that a metal ball should sink in water. Typically, properties and affordances of materials have been studied with perceptual tasks. But even though explicit perceptual judgments allow us to identify important determinants of material understanding, it is not clear how they relate to dynamic predictions of material behavior - which we need for successful interactions with objects. Here, we tap into material understanding by leveraging anticipatory eye movements, which have been shown to be direct readouts of trajectory predictions and can also reflect expectations about material properties such as elasticity or mass. This allows us to reveal the temporal evolution of dynamic predictions based on material properties. Furthermore, by using novel stimuli that violate intuitive expectations about material behavior, we demonstrate that even though dynamic predictions can be learned over time, there remains a fundamental difference between predictions in line with and against our intuitive expectations.",

      "title": "Ventral pallidal perineuronal nets regulate opioid relapse",
      "content": "Opioid use disorder remains a major health challenge worldwide. Neuronal activity in the ventral pallidum (VP) regulates opioid reward and relapse to opioid seeking but the underlying cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown. A sizable population of VP neurons previously linked to drug relapse expresses the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (VPPV). Across the brain parvalbumin neurons are often ensheathed by perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized extracellular structures that regulate intrinsic activity and constrain synaptic plasticity onto these neurons. The VP contains high levels of PNNs but the role of these structures in the neurophysiology of VPPV neurons and in relapse to opioid seeking has not been studied. To investigate whether VP PNNs are altered by opioid exposure, male and female mice were trained to self-administer intravenous heroin. We found that heroin increased the density of PNNs in the VP, and that an intracranial microinfusion of the PNN-degrading enzyme, chondroitinase ABC, prevented cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. VP PNN depletion also reduced the intrinsic excitability of VPPV neurons, potentiated inhibitory synaptic inputs onto these cells, and diminished Fos expression in VPPV neurons following reinstatement. The suppressive effect of VP PNN depletion on heroin seeking was rescued by chemogenetic activation of VPPV neurons and mimicked by chemogenetic VPPV neuron inhibition. Taken together, our results identify VPPV neurons and their associated PNNs as critical drivers of opioid seeking. Given the key role of PNNs in regulating neural plasticity and memory processes, targeting PNNs in the VP could provide a useful novel therapeutic avenue for treating persistent craving and relapse in opioid use disorder.",
