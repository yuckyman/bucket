      "title": "Genetic Interaction of APOE-E-4 and PICALM rs3851179 is Associated With Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Healthy Middle-Aged Adults at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder in which genetic risk variants, including APOE E4 (A+) and the PICALM rs3851179 variant (P+), are linked to altered brain function. Objective: To test whether dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) dwell-time patterns from resting-state fMRI differ by AD genetic risk in cognitively healthy, middle-aged adults. Methods: We estimated recurring dFC clusters from rs-fMRI and computed dwell-time (total time spent in each cluster) for individuals in not-at-risk, A+P-, and A+P+ groups. Group differences in dwell-time profiles were assessed, and logistic regression with permutation testing evaluated the association between dwell-time features and genotype. Results: At-risk groups (A+P-, A+P+) spent less time in left-hemisphere hubs than not-at-risk individuals, consistent with reports of left-hemisphere vulnerability in AD. Logistic regression showed modest above-chance genotype discrimination, with permutation tests indicating a marginal trend when comparing not-at-risk versus at-risk (A+P-, A+P+) groups. Conclusions: Dwell-time features from dFC states show preliminary sensitivity to AD genetic risk and warrant evaluation in larger samples as potential early risk markers.

      "title": "Multi-Timescale Neural Adaptation Failure as a Mechanistic Signature of Major Depression",
      "content": "Major depression (MD) is usually characterized in terms of momentary abnormalities, such as negative bias or emotional blunting, derived from paradigms that measure only the first response to a stimulus. Yet depressive experience in daily life is repetitive and cumulative. Here we test the hypothesis that a failure of neural adaptation across repetitions is a core feature of MD. Using a repeated negative-stimulus paradigm, we quantified adaptation at micro (within-trial) and macro (across-session) scales via electroencephalography in 28 MD patients and 34 healthy controls, measuring both conventional event-related potentials and large-scale traveling-wave propagation. MD patients exhibited pervasive maladaptation: neural rigidity at the micro scale (absent repetition suppression) and progressive regulatory depletion at the macro scale (escalating emotional reactivity with declining cognitive control). Across analyses, adaptation-based metrics revealed larger group differences than single-shot indices, and classifiers built on adaptation features-especially traveling-wave dynamics-outperformed single-shot models (task AUC = 0.83 vs 0.78) and generalized to two independent datasets (up to AUC = 0.91). These findings challenge conventional symptom-based characterizations of MD, establishing adaptation failure-not initial reactivity-as the mechanistically primary pathological signature. This reframing provides a unified mechanistic explanation for rumination and cognitive inflexibility while offering a standardized, low-cost biomarker requiring minimal electrodes ([&le;]8 channels), enabling large-scale screening in resource-limited settings.",

      "title": "Crossfrequency routing in a hippocampocortical circuit during probabilistic reversal learning",
      "content": "Learning under uncertainty requires detecting latent changes in environmental contingencies and flexibly adjusting choice strategy. To model this process and identify associated circuit dynamics, we trained rats on a two armed bandit task with uncued reward reversals while simultaneously recording local field potentials from the circuit comprised by dorsal hippocampus (CA1d), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral performance improved with training and progressively shifted from outcome-reactive exploration to an exploitation-biased strategy, quantified using a model-free index. Mixed-effects modeling combining behavioral and neural metrics identified tonic cortical synchrony in theta and fast gamma bands as a negative session scale performance marker. Theta and gamma oscillations were coordinated, as crossregional phase amplitude coupling showed that CA1d theta phase gated fast gamma activity in PFC, while biasing both slow and fast gamma bursts in LEC, which selectively increased at goal reaching. Neuronal spiking showed crossregional phase locking to both theta and gamma rhythms, indicating synchronized timing across the hippocampo-cortical circuit. Finally, distributed neuronal spiking across the circuit represented goal approach, yet only prefrontal neurons ramped during goal-reaching, suggesting a role in outcome assessment, while hippocampal and entorhinal units transiently suppressed, consistent with locomotor tracking and resetting. These results reveal a tonic cortical connectivity marker of ongoing performance during reversal learning and dissociate it from hippocampal theta mechanisms that selectively organize cortical gamma bursts and spike timing. Together, these results provide mechanistic insight into how frequency specific hippocampocortical interactions dynamically reconfigure to support strategy transitions, offering a circuit-level framework for understanding adaptive decision making under uncertainty.",

      "title": "Mapping glioblastoma spreading: connexin43 and glial dynamic in mouse and human glioblastoma microenvironment",
      "content": "High-grade gliomas (HGGs), including astrocytoma and glioblastoma (GBM), constitute the most prevalent primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). GBM cells demonstrate a notable ability to infiltrate the brain paren-chyma, precluding complete surgical resection. Here we investigated the spreading of GBM cells and the response of the CNS microenvironment fo-cusing on glial cells, which are essential interactors to GBM. We used acute and organotypic slices from the mouse brain and peritumoral cortex of patients with HGGs. We found that human peritumoral tissue from cortical resection was characterized by high levels of the astrocytic Connex-in43 protein (Cx43) and discrete infiltration of microglia. In contrast, the tu-mor core exhibited high myeloid infiltration and an altered extracellular ma-trix (ECM) composition, which was poor in CD44. We tracked mouse and primary human-labeled-GBM cells in 2D cultures and in co-culture with or-ganotypic slices generated from mouse brain and human peritumoral tissues. We found that the implanted GBM cells infiltrated the brain tissue, implying early glial modifications including an increase in Cx43 expression and distri-bution. Furthermore, the blockage of Cx43 hemichannels was accompanied by morphological changes and polarization of human GBM cells, typical for migration phenomena. The present study sheds light on the dynamics of GBM cells spreading in the living brain tissue, suggesting that the progression of the tumor correlates with changes within the host brain. Our findings identify the upregulation of Cx43 expression as a highly consistent modification in both mouse and human tissue that may be crucial for GBM infiltration.",

      "title": "The glutamine transporter Slc38a1 is widely expressed in the embryonic neurogenic niches and impacts neuronal volume, survival, and morphology",
      "content": "The amino acid glutamine, and its derivatives glutamate and GABA, are pivotal for neurogenesis. However, how glutamine is mechanistically supplied to the cells in the neurogenic niches and its broader impact on neurodevelopment, remain poorly characterized. The Solute carrier family 38 member 1 (Slc38a1) exhibits high affinity for glutamine and accumulates glutamine in select cells. We investigated whether Slc38a1 is essential for neurogenesis and whether it has an impact on brain structure and function. Slc38a1 mRNA transcript and protein are widely expressed in the embryonic brain, including in the dorsal pallium and sub-pallium. At embryonic day 15.5, Slc38a1 localizes in neuronal stem cells in the ventricular zone in the forebrain, while it localizes in mature neurons in the sub-ventricular zone of the hindbrain. In the adult brain, Slc38a1 is not detected in neuronal stem cells in the sub-granular zone, however, it is highly enriched in mature local parvalbumin+ and somatostatin+ interneurons and ependyma. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data further reveal that both the number of Slc38a1-expressing cells and the average transcript level of Slc38a1 are significantly higher in embryo brain cells compared to adults. In the embryo, Slc38a1 transcripts are particularly enriched in immature neuronal lineages and embryonic oligodendrocyte precursor populations, whereas in the adult, expression is more prominent in neural progenitor cells and radial glia. Disruption of Slc38a1 in mice impacts body weight, brain size and glutamatergic neuronal volume, while dendritic arborization is diminished and cellular life span is shortened. Altogether, Slc38a1 is essential for normal neurodevelopment, indirectly regulates adult neurogenesis in the sub-granular zone and influence neuronal morphology and cell viability.",

      "content": "Studies on first-year infants' pitch perception have witnessed shifts of perceptual focus from acoustic to linguistic information and from a wide range of contrasts to those relevant to their native language. Nevertheless, how linguistic experience interacts with this developmental process remains an open question. This study compared the neural discrimination of speech/lexical and nonspeech/violin tone contrasts by 5- to 6- and 11- to 12-month-old infants across three types of language backgrounds: monolingual infants learning a non-tone language (Mono), bilingual infants learning two non-tone languages (Bi-NT), and bilingual infants learning a non-tone and a tone language (Bi-Tone). Although Mono infants do not show significant responses to the lexical tone contrast, both Bi-NT and Bi-Tone infants showed positive mismatch responses at both ages, indicating an enhancement effect brought by a complex language environment as early as 5 months after birth. Regarding the violin tone perception, distinct patterns were observed across language backgrounds: a perceptual decrease for Mono infants, no significant response for Bi-NT infants, and a perceptual increase for Bi-Tone infants over the first year. These patterns suggest that pitch perception may be affected across domains by language experiences at this stage, where interactions in cognitive processing between speech and nonspeech prosodic information may occur.",

      "content": "The ability to adapt to varying task demands is essential for goal-directed behavior. Cognitive control styles regulate this adaptation, with persistence reflecting high top\u2013down control and flexibility reflecting lower control. Metacontrol facilitates the dynamic adjustment between these states based on current demands. The present study investigated short-term feedback-dependent adaptations in cognitive control style during conflict monitoring. Behavioral results demonstrated that RT feedback promoted a more persistent cognitive control style in subsequent trials, improving performance in incongruent conditions while diminishing facilitative effects in congruent conditions. On the neurophysiological level, theta-band activity primarily reflected these changes during conflict processing. Crucially, intertrial interval analyses revealed a key role of beta-band activity in using RT feedback. Correlations with behavioral congruency effects suggested that decreased beta-band activity reflected a generally more flexible control style, whereas increased beta-band activity was associated with generally greater persistence. By demonstrating that pretrial beta-band modulations reflect cognitive control dispositions, this study provides novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying metacontrol.",

      "title": "The Role of Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Neural Differentiation of Memories in the Hippocampus",
      "content": "When faced with a familiar situation, we can use memory to make predictions about what will happen next. If such predictions turn out to be erroneous, the brain can adapt by differentiating the representations of the cue from the mispredicted item itself, reducing the likelihood of future prediction errors. Prior work by Kim, G., Norman, K. A., and Turk-Browne, N. B. Neural differentiation of incorrectly predicted memories. Journal of Neuroscience, 37, 2022\u20132031 [2017] found that violating a sequential association in a statistical learning paradigm triggered differentiation of the neural representations of the associated items in the hippocampus. Here, we used fMRI to test the preregistered hypothesis that this hippocampal differentiation occurs only when violations are followed by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Participants first learned that some items predict others (e.g., A predicts B) and then encountered a violation in which a predicted item (B) failed to appear when expected after its associated item (A); the predicted item later appeared on its own after an unrelated item. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of three conditions: remain awake, take a nap containing non-REM sleep only, or take a nap with both non-REM and REM sleep. While the predicted results were not observed in the preregistered left CA2/3/dentate gyrus (DG) ROI, we did observe evidence for our hypothesis in closely related hippocampal ROIs, uncorrected for multiple comparisons: In right CA2/3/DG, differentiation in the group with REM sleep was greater than in the groups without REM sleep (wake and non-REM nap); this differentiation was item-specific and concentrated in right DG. REM-related differentiation effects were also greater in bilateral DG when the predicted item was more strongly reactivated during the violation. Overall, these results provide initial evidence linking REM sleep to changes in the hippocampal representations of memories in humans.",

      "title": "Scene-sensitive Medial Temporal Lobe Subregions Are Recruited for the Integration of Non-scene Stimuli",
      "content": "A hallmark feature of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly recombine information across episodes to form new associations and guide behavior. This process, termed associative inference, relies on the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. We previously found that cross-episode binding was improved when episodes were linked by scenes rather than by faces or objects. Here, we tested whether differential recruitment of category-sensitive MTL subregions underlies these behavioral differences. Participants completed study-test phases of the Associative Inference in Memory task while undergoing fMRI scanning. During the study phase, they encoded overlapping AB and BC pairs. A and C items were always objects. The linking B item was either a face or a scene. At test, memory for the direct (AB, BC) and indirect associations (inferred AC) was tested. Category sensitivity in MTL subregions was tested using an independent functional localizer and the low integration (AB) trials from the study phase of the Associative Inference in Memory task. Within the MTL, no subregions exhibited face sensitivity. The anterior hippocampal head, anterolateral and posteromedial entorhinal cortices, and parahippocampal cortex were identified as scene sensitive. Although accuracy of the indirect inferences did not differ between pairs linked by faces and scenes, MTL subregion recruitment differed across categories. Scene-sensitive subregions in MTL cortex (anterolateral entorhinal cortex, posteromedial entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal cortex), but not the hippocampus (anterior hippocampal head), were recruited to support associative inference for faces during encoding. These findings suggest that regions in MTL cortex identified as scene sensitive here may be involved in integrating disparate elements of episodes into coherent representations, and may be recruited for non-scene stimuli when integration demands during encoding are high (e.g., during associative inference).",

      "title": "Increasing Signal, Reducing Noise: Contrasting Neural Mechanisms of Attention in Visual Search",
      "content": "When invariant target\u2013distractor arrays are presented repeatedly during visual search, participants respond faster on repeated versus novel configuration trials. This effect reflects attentional guidance through long-term memory (LTM) templates\u2014a phenomenon termed contextual cueing. Subsequently, relocating the target within the same distractor layout abolishes any contextual cueing effects, and relearning the new target position is much harder than the initial learning\u2014likely due to consistent attentional misguidance toward the initial (learned) target position. Here, we studied how the different processes involved in contextual cueing and relearning affect the variability of neural responses in human participants as measured with EEG. Attention has previously been shown to reduce trial-by-trial variability in EEG [Arazi, A., Yeshurun, Y., & Dinstein, I. Neural variability is quenched by attention. Journal of Neuroscience, 39, 5975\u20135985, 2019], indicating that, in addition to increasing the neural response to an attended stimulus, attention may reduce the noise within the neural response itself. While repeated versus novel contexts did not modulate the trial-by-trial variability during initial learning, significant lateralized variability reductions were observed for repeated but not novel context trials in the relocations phase. This contrasts with how contextual cueing affected lateralized ERPs in past research. Zinchenko and colleagues [Zinchenko, A., Conci, M., T\u00f6llner, T., M\u00fcller, H. J., & Geyer, T. Automatic guidance (and misguidance) of visuospatial attention by acquired scene memory: Evidence from an N1pc polarity reversal. Psychological Science, 31, 1531\u20131543, 2020] found that lateralized ERPs signal correct and incorrect (i.e., misguided) attentional selection of target positions learned earlier. This phenomenon was observed during both the learning and relocation phases. Thus, variability and lateralized ERPs may represent different facets of attention, where variability becomes evident specifically under high attentional demand conditions, such as when participants must override the misguidance caused by LTM templates.",

      "content": "Graphical representations of quantitative data abound in our culture, and yet the brain mechanisms of graphicacy, by which viewers quickly extract statistical information from a data graphic, are unknown. Here, using scatterplots as stimuli, we tested two hypotheses about the brain areas underlying graphicacy. First, at the perceptual level, we hypothesized that the visual processing of scatterplots and their main trend recycles cortical regions devoted to the perception of the principal axis of objects. Second, at a higher level, we speculated that the math-responsive network active during arithmetic and mathematical truth judgments should also be involved in graphical perception. Using fMRI, we indeed found that the judgment of the trend in a scatterplot recruits a right lateral occipital area involved in detecting the orientation of objects, as well as a right anterior intraparietal region also recruited during mathematical tasks. Both behavior and brain activity were driven by the t value that indexes the statistical correlation in the data, and right intraparietal activation covaried with participants' graphicacy level. On the basis of this first approach to the neural bases of graphical perception, we suggest that, like literacy and numeracy, graphicacy relies on the recycling of brain areas previously attuned to a similar problem, here the perception of object orientation.",

      "content": "Predictive processing plays a central role in language comprehension, allowing listeners to generate predictions about upcoming linguistic input. Although considerable evidence supports segmental prediction, less is known about whether listeners can form predictions about suprasegmental features such as lexical tone. This study investigates whether listeners can generate and neurally represent predicted tonal information in the absence of auditory input. Using a Mandarin Chinese tone sandhi paradigm, we established tonal predictions based on sentence and visual context, recording brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analysis showed that predicted tonal categories could be decoded from brain activity even without tonal stimuli present. These representations were localized in auditory areas, articulatory motor regions, and the right cerebellum. We also found that predicted tone representations had distinct neural substrates compared to perceived tone representations. The study provides direct neural evidence that listeners can form representations of lexical tone in predictions of auditory input. The findings expand our understanding of suprasegmental prediction in speech and highlight the cerebellum's role in linguistic prediction.",

      "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

      "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",
