      "title": "The CHAT System: A Wearable Haptic System for Facilitating Tactile Communication",
      "content": "Despite the richness of the human tactile capacity, remote communication practices often lack touch-based interactions. This leads to overtaxing our visual and auditory channels, a lack of connection and engagement, and inaccessibility for diverse sensory groups. In this paper, we learn from haptic intuitions of the blind and low vision (BLV) and the Protactile DeafBlind (PT-DB) community to investigate how core functions of communication can be routed through tactile channels. We investigate this re-routing by designing the Conversational Haptic Technology (CHAT) system, a wearable haptic system to explore the feasibility of language recreation through core functions of communication and emotional expression via touch. We contribute the design evolution of an input (sensing) pad and an output (actuation) pad, which enable a bidirectional, wireless system to support remote, touch-based communication. These systems were iteratively evaluated through a series of user studies with sighted-hearing (N=20), BLV (N=4), and PT-DB (N=7) participants to uncover touch profiles for relaying specific communication functions and emotional responses. Results indicate trends and similarities in the touch-based cues organically employed across the diverse groups and provide an initial framework for demonstrating the feasibility of communicating core functions through touch in a wearable form factor.",

      "content": "The Snail is a wearable haptic interface that enables users to experience force feedback when grasping objects in Virtual Reality. It consists of a 3D-printed prop attached to the tip of the thumb that can rotate thanks to a small actuator. The prop is shaped like a snail to display different grasping sizes, ranging from $ 1.5\\,\\text{cm}$ to $ 7\\,\\text{cm}$, according to its orientation. The prop displays the force feedback, so forces over $ 100\\,\\text{N}$ can be displayed between fingers using small and low-power actuation. Very rigid objects can be rendered when the prop remains static, but rotations when the users grasp the prop also allow for the simulation of soft objects. The Snail is portable, low-cost, and easy to reproduce because it is made of 3D-printed parts. The design and performance of the device were evaluated through technical evaluations and 3 user experiments. They show that participants can discriminate different grasping sizes and levels of softness with the interface. The Snail also enhances user experience and performances in Virtual Reality compared to standard vibration feedback.",

      "title": "Closed-Loop Manual Control With Tactile or Visual Feedback Under Wireless Link Impairments",
      "content": "The emergence of low-latency wireless connectivity has opened significant new possibilities for closed-loop human-machine interaction (HMI) systems. However, data transmission, particularly over wireless links, suffers from impairments, such as random latency fluctuations and packet loss, affecting the overall control performance of HMI systems. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of wireless impairments for a closed-loop joystick-controlled trajectory tracking task. This has been done with two different types of feedback, visual and tactile, respectively. Wireless links were used both in the uplink transmission of command signal and the downlink transmission of feedback signal. The effects of wireless impairments were incorporated by artificially introducing latency, jitter, and packet loss recorded in real-life deployment scenarios, both in the uplink and the downlink. The results obtained across 12 healthy participants showed that the tracking performance was better with visual feedback than with tactile feedback across all impairment conditions. The average latency significantly affected performance, while random latency fluctuations did not. Interestingly, the performance degradation due to increasing impairments in case of tactile feedback was similar to the one observed for visual feedback. One of the main novelties brought by this study is the quantification of the impact of wireless impairments on closed-loop teleoperation tasks with tactile feedback. The results provide valuable insights for designing wireless infrastructure for tactile internet applications.",

      "title": "Measurement of Airborne Ultrasound Focus on Skin Surface Using Thermal Imaging",
      "content": "In recent years, tactile presentation technology using airborne ultrasound has attracted attention. To achieve an ideal tactile presentation using ultrasound, the acoustic field on the user's skin surface must be determined, particularly the location of the focal point. Previous studies have suggested that thermal images can be used to immediately visualize sound pressure patterns on finger surfaces. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the performance of thermal imaging for measuring the ultrasound focus on the skin. First, we confirmed that the sound pressure peak at the focus and the temperature change peak were matched using silicone that mimicked the skin. In addition, we confirmed that when human skin was irradiated, a temperature increase was observed at above 4.0 kPa in 9 out of 10 participants. Moreover, a 5.5 kPa focus could be employed to track the focal position. if the moving velocity was less than 100 mm/s and to detect the orbit if the velocity was less than 2000 mm/s. These results clarify the situation in which the focus can be measured by using thermal images and provide guidelines for practical use.",

      "title": "TexSenseGAN: A User-Guided System for Optimizing Texture-Related Vibrotactile Feedback Using Generative Adversarial Network",
      "content": "Vibration rendering is essential for creating realistic tactile experiences in human-virtual object interactions, such as in video game controllers and VR devices. By dynamically adjusting vibration parameters based on user actions, these systems can convey spatial features and contribute to texture representation. However, generating arbitrary vibrations to replicate real-world material textures is challenging due to the large parameter space. This study proposes a human-in-the-loop vibration generation model based on user preferences. To enable users to easily control the generation of vibration samples with large parameter spaces, we introduced an optimization model based on Differential Subspace Search (DSS) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). With DSS, users can employ a one-dimensional slider to easily modify the high-dimensional latent space to ensure that the GAN can generate desired vibrations. We trained the generative model using an open dataset of tactile vibration data and selected five types of vibrations as target samples for the generation experiment. Extensive user experiments were conducted using the generated and real samples. The results indicated that our system could generate distinguishable samples that matched the target characteristics. Moreover, we established a correlation between subjects' ability to distinguish real samples and their ability to distinguish generated samples.",

      "content": "Low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) are somatosensory neurons that detect innocuous light touch stimuli such as vibration, hair deflection, and pressure. They form subtype-specific terminals in the periphery and project axons centrally to the spinal cord to transmit tactile information. Current understanding about LTMR development and organization comes from fixed-tissue studies that cannot reveal the dynamic and temporal processes of neuronal wiring and remodeling. Here, we demonstrate a two-photon imaging method for visualizing LTMR axon morphology in the mouse right forepaw during development and in young adults. Two-photon microscopy can achieve high-resolution imaging within intact skin, allowing repeated imaging of the same axon terminals over postnatal timepoints. These approaches provide an in vivo system for studying the cellular mechanisms that regulate LTMR patterning and plasticity. Its application to longitudinal analyses will enable the observation of the assembly of touch circuits and their repair following injury. This technique may provide essential information about somatosensory axon structure and function in the skin.",

      "title": "No effect of continuous transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation on the P3 and the P600 in an oddball and sentence comprehension task",
      "content": "The ERP components P3 and P600 have been proposed to reflect phasic activity of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC/NE) system in response to deviant and task-relevant stimuli across cognitive domains. Yet, causal evidence for this link remains limited. Here, we used continuous transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), a non-invasive method proposed to modulate LC/NE activity, to test whether these components are indeed sensitive to noradrenergic manipulation. Forty participants completed both an active visual oddball task and a sentence processing task including both syntactic and semantic violations, while receiving continuous taVNS at the cymba conchae in one session and sham stimulation at the earlobe in another session. We observed robust P3 and P600 effects. Crucially though, taVNS had no effect on P3 or P600 amplitude. The physiological NE markers salivary alpha amylase level and baseline pupil size were also unaffected by the stimulation, suggesting that the taVNS protocol and/or task may not have been sufficient to successfully engage the norepinephrine system. Beyond the stimulation, however, exploratory analyses revealed correlations between the syntactic P600 and both the P3 and salivary alpha amylase levels, supporting the idea that the P600 might be related to both the P3 and NE. Overall, our findings do not allow for theoretical implications concerning a potential causal link between the two components and NE but highlight the need for more standardized taVNS protocols.",

      "title": "MAVeRiC-AD: Mixture-of-experts Agentic Vision-Language Ensemble for Robust MRI Classification of Alzheimer's Disease",
      "content": "Robust classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural T1-weighted MRI (T1w) images remains an unmet clinical need, especially when data is acquired at multiple sites that differ in scanning protocols and population demographics. In this paper, we present MAVeRiC-AD (Mixture-of-experts Agent-guided Vision-Language Ensemble for Robust Imaging-based classification of Alzheimer's Disease), an agentic framework that dynamically utilizes the optimal inferencing tool for radiological queries to provide relevant answers to the user. In our framework, we tested three specialized models encoded as callable tools: (1) CNN-AD, a 3D DenseNet trained on T1w intensities only; (2) MOE-VLM, a vision-language model that jointly models the T1w with subject-specific demographics (age, sex, site) via a mixture-of-experts (MoE) projection head; (3) Retrieval engine, a similarity-search module that contextualizes a patient against others from the site and reports % prevalence of AD. A light-weight agent analyzes the user request and then routes the input (image, or image + text) to the appropriate tool, aggregates responses and returns the tool response augmented with its confidence derived from conformal prediction. Experiments were conducted using T1w images from the ADNI (N=4,098) and OASIS-3 (N=600) datasets. Single-site training baselines achieved ROC-AUC = 0.79 (CNN) and 0.82 (VLM) on ADNI. When trained jointly on both sites, MOE-VLM surpassed both image-only and standard vision-language models with ROC-AUC = 0.90 on ADNI and 0.81 on OASIS. MAVeRiC-AD demonstrates that agentic orchestration of complementary expert deep models, coupled with explicit demographic conditioning for multi-site data can improve robustness and interpretability of AD image analysis pipelines and serves as a blueprint for scalable, trustworthy clinical AI assistants.",

      "title": "stk32a links sleep homeostasis to suppression of sensory and motor systems",
      "content": "Sleep is regulated by a homeostatic process and associated with an increased arousal threshold, but the genetic and neuronal mechanisms that implement these essential features of sleep remain poorly understood. To address these fundamental questions, we performed a zebrafish genetic screen informed by human genome-wide association studies. We found that mutation of serine/threonine kinase 32a (stk32a) results in increased sleep and impaired sleep homeostasis in both zebrafish and mice, and that stk32a acts downstream of neurotensin signaling and the serotonergic raphe in zebrafish. stk32a mutation reduces phosphorylation of neurofilament proteins, which are co-expressed with stk32a in neurons that regulate motor activity and in lateral line hair cells that detect environmental stimuli, and ablating these cells phenocopies stk32a mutation. Neurotensin signaling inhibits specific sensory and motor populations, and blocks stimulus-evoked responses of neurons that relay sensory information from hair cells to the brain. Our work thus shows that stk32a is an evolutionarily conserved sleep regulator that links neuropeptidergic and neuromodulatory systems to homeostatic sleep drive and changes in arousal threshold, which are implemented through suppression of specific sensory and motor systems.",

      "title": "Forebrain-specific loss of erythropoietin provokes compensatory upregulation of different EPO receptors",
      "content": "The procognitive growth factor erythropoietin (EPO) and its canonical receptor, EPOR, have long been recognized to be expressed by most cell types in the brain. Cognitive domains, improved by injections of exogenous EPO or by endogenous, hypoxia-stimulated EPO, include important forebrain functions, namely attention, working memory, drive, and executive performance. To gain mechanistic insight into the involvement of forebrain-expressed EPO, we deleted EPO in mice using as specific cre-driver Emx1. Here, we report that these mutant mice act comparably to their wildtype littermates in a comprehensive behavioral test battery. Importantly, we find that the transcripts of both EPOR and a novel, brain-expressed EPO receptor, EphB4, respond to EPO deletion with compensatory upregulation. EphB4 expression in brain and its increase upon forebrain erasure of EPOR are confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The augmented expression of both EPOR and EphB4 and their regulatory intercorrelation may explain why EmxEPO mutants show an even superior performance in the most challenging working memory task. Using the previously published single-nuclei-RNA-seq dataset, we further confirm the suggested compensatory mechanism, wherein EPO loss or reduction drives elevated EPOR expression, adding another layer to the intricate regulation of EPO signaling in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Collectively, these data may explain the lack of behavioral and negative cognitive consequences upon forebrain-wide EPO elimination.",
