      "title": "Individualized connectomic tACS immediately improves oscillatory network with language facilitation in post-stroke aphasia: a feasibility study of a dysfunctome-based targeting approach",
      "content": "IntroductionPeople with post-stroke aphasia (PSA) exhibit significant interindividual variability attributed to distinctive network disruption patterns across individuals. This complexity limits the effectiveness of conventional one-size-fits-all brain stimulation approaches, but to date no individualized tACS targeting on functional network was studied in PSA. This two-phase study aimed to investigate the immediate network-modulation and language-facilitation effects of dual-site in-phase tACS utilizing a novel individualized targeting method based on individual\u2019s EEG dysfunctome.MethodsIn the first phase, network-based linear regression was used to identify aphasia-severity-predictive dysfunctome from the speech-production EEG data of 15 Cantonese-speaking people with aphasia (PWA). Individualized stimulation targets were determined using two targeting principles. Restoration-based targeting aims to restore a target edge which is centralized within the target dysfunctome but weakly-connected in the individual, whereas enhancement-based targeting selects a strongly-connected target edge. The second phase involved a single-session double-blinded sham-controlled trial with the same group to evaluate the immediate effects of dual-site 7-Hz 1-mA tACS under four conditions: Restoration In-phase (RI), Enhancement In-phase (EI), Enhancement Anti-phase (EA), and Sham (SH).ResultsIn the first phase, we explored a range of frequency bands and EEG tasks and identified a left frontal-temporal theta network under divergent naming task that significantly predicted aphasia severity. The single-session clinical trial in the second phase demonstrated that RI condition produced increases in the target node strength, global network properties, and divergent naming performance, which were absent in sham and the other two real stimulation conditions.DiscussionThis was the first-of-its-kind dysfunctome-based data-driven individualized tACS demonstrated immediate neuromodulatory effects in PSA. The findings suggest that EEG dysfunctome can help pinpointing effective individualized targets for tACS to promote clinically-beneficial functional reorganization. Despite limited generalizability due to the small sample, this methodology holds significant potential for application in longer-term treatment and other network-based disorders.",

      "title": "Statistical characterization of cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics evoked by cortical stimulation in mice",
      "content": "Objective. Statistical models are powerful tools for describing biological phenomena such as neuronal spiking activity. Although these models have been widely used to study spontaneous and stimulated neuronal activity, they have not yet been applied to analyze responses to electrical cortical stimulation. In this study, we present an innovative approach to characterize neuronal responses to electrical stimulation in the mouse cortex, providing detailed insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Approach. Our method applies mixture models to analyze the Peri-Stimulus time histogram of each neuron, predicting the probability of spiking at specific latencies following the onset of electrical stimuli. By applying this approach, we investigated neuronal responses to cortical stimulation recorded from the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, and sensorimotor-related thalamic nuclei in the mouse brain. Main results. The characterization approach achieved high goodness of fit, and the model features were leveraged by applying machine learning methods for stimulus intensity decoding and classification of brain regions to which a neuron belongs given its response to the stimulus. The random forest model demonstrated the highest F1 scores, achieving 92.86% for stimulus intensity decoding and 84.35% for brain zone classification. Significance. This study presents a novel statistical framework for characterizing neuronal responses to electrical cortical stimulation, providing quantitative insights into cortical\u2013thalamic dynamics. Our approach achieves high accuracy in stimulus decoding and brain region classification, providing valuable contributions for neuroscience research and neuro-technology applications.",

      "title": "Freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease is related to imbalanced stopping-related cortical activity",
      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

We also discuss the lessons learned through the project, with the aim of enabling researchers in...",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",

Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",
