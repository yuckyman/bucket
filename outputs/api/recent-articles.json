      "content": "The poultry red mite (PRM) feeds on hens' blood at night, disrupting sleep, harming welfare, and reducing productivity. Effective control may lie in dynamic Integrated Pest Management (IPM), which relies on routine monitoring and adaptation to farm conditions. This study investigated how PRM infestations affect the night-time activity of hens. Three groups of eight hens, housed in enriched cages, were monitored with night-vision cameras over a two-month period, both before and after artificial...",

      "title": "High-Density Tactile Sensor Array for Sub-Millimeter Texture Recognition",
      "content": "High-density tactile sensor arrays that replicate human touch could restore texture perception in paralyzed individuals. However, conventional tactile sensor arrays face inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, sensitivity, and crosstalk suppression due to microstructure size limitations and signal interference. To address this, we developed a tactile sensor featuring 10 \u03bcm-scale pyramid tips that achieve ultra-high sensitivity (8.082 kPa^(-1) in 0.2-0.5 kPa range). By integrating a...",

      "content": "It has been argued in previous research that several competing pressures guide the directions of language evolution (economy vs. redundancy; arbitrariness vs. systematicity). For sign languages, however, the effects of competing pressures on their change of lexical systems remain largely unclear. In the present study, we focus on the diachronic change in form and formational-semantic systematicity of the Chinese Sign Language (CSL) lexicon. Drawing on two CSL lexicons (one from the 1960...",
