      "title": "Adaptation response to pitch shift during speech is attenuated upon relearning",
      "content": "IntroductionDuring sensorimotor adaptation, participants respond to a persistent sensory error by shifting behavior to oppose the error. This phenomenon has been measured in multiple motor tasks in which sensory feedback is experimentally altered to artificially introduce an error. Tasks involving multiple cycles of altered and unaltered feedback have been used in the arm reaching domain to understand the mechanisms of un-learning and re-learning a response to an error, but re-learning within a single session has not been studied in the domain of fundamental frequency (f0) control during speech.MethodsIn this study, participants responded to three alternating blocks of f0-shifted and unshifted auditory feedback during a single-word speech task.ResultsIt was found that on average, adaptation magnitude decreased in the second and third blocks of shifted feedback compared to the first. This illustrates an attenuation effect similar to that observed in studies of implicit learning in arm reaching tasks.DiscussionThese results support the understanding of f0 control as an implicit learning phenomenon and help place f0 control in the context of motor control in general.",

      "title": "Pattern-induced visual discomfort and its cumulative effects revealed by pupillary measures",
      "content": "IntroductionViewing repetitive striped patterns can induce pattern glare, experienced as visual discomfort (VD). While previous studies examined either pupillary responses or VD separately, few have investigated how they covary or evolve with repeated exposure. This study tested whether pupillary dynamics could serve as potential physiological indicator of individual visual sensitivity beyond subjective reports.MethodsAcross four experiments (preliminary: n = 97; main: n = 70 for spatial frequency, n = 46 for central field size, n = 36 for central blank, with partial overlap), we manipulated spatial frequency, central field size, and surround field size of square-wave gratings (0.5\u20133 s) while measuring both discomfort and pupil size.ResultsHigher spatial frequencies and larger pattern areas elicited stronger pupillary constriction and greater discomfort, whereas repeated exposures produced cumulative increases in discomfort and decreases in baseline pupil size, consistent with visual strain rather than adaptation. To assess the potential of pupillometry as an indicator of visual discomfort, we examined individual differences in the main spatial-frequency experiment (controlled viewing distance, n = 42). A paradoxical pattern emerged: within participants, stronger stimuli produced greater constriction, but individuals with higher overall discomfort showed weaker constriction and stronger late redilation. Similar dissociations between subjective sensitivity and pupillary responses have been noted in studies of light-induced discomfort, suggesting that related mechanisms may contribute, although their specific physiological basis remains unclear.DiscussionOverall, our findings clarify how pattern-induced discomfort evolves over time and across individuals and highlight pupillometry's potential as a sensitive, physiological tool for assessing visual sensitivity.",

      "title": "Neuronal Toll-like Receptor-4 regulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 Activity Mediates Dentate Circuit Dysfunction after Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "content": "Neuroinflammatory pathways activated by traumatic brain injury (TBI) are critical mediators of long-term neurological dysfunction and represent promising therapeutic targets. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an innate immune receptor, was previously shown to contribute to seizure susceptibility and cognitive deficits in rats after lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying TLR4-mediated circuit dysfunction early after brain injury is not fully understood. In this study, we define a cell- and circuit- specific neuroimmune-extracellular matrix signaling axis that mediates early post-TBI circuit dysfunction in the hippocampal Dentate Gyrus (DG). Using ex vivo electrophysiology in rat and mouse models one-week after brain injury, we demonstrate that neuronal TLR4 signaling regulates both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to dentate granule cells (DGC). Pharmacological inhibition of TLR4 in rats within 24 hours post-injury and cell-type-specific deletion of TLR4 in glutamatergic neurons in mice demonstrated that injury-driven excitatory circuit dysfunction is mediated by neuronal TLR4 and relies on downstream activation of Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), an enzyme critical for extracellular matrix remodeling. In contrast, TLR4-dependent alterations in inhibitory inputs occurred independent of MMP-9, revealing a mechanistic divergence. Early inhibition of either TLR4 signaling or MMP-9 activity in rats within 24 hours post-injury reduced network hyperexcitability, improved long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus measured in vivo one-week after injury, and attenuated long-term deficits in spatial memory one-month post-injury. Furthermore, we demonstrate a context-dependent role for TLR4 signaling contributing to circuit homeostasis in the uninjured brain and driving circuit dysfunction in the injured brain. Together, these results identify a novel TLR4 -MMP-9 axis as a key driver of early post-TBI dentate gyrus circuit dysfunction and behavioral deficits.",

      "content": "This perspective article explores the transformative potential of brain\u2013Computer Interfaces (BCI) in undergraduate systems engineering programs, a domain characterized by high attrition and a widening gap between rapid technological innovation and slower pedagogical change. I argue that BCI, by enabling real-time detection of cognitive states such as mental workload, attention, and frustration, can evolve from laboratory tools to central pedagogical instruments for adaptive, student-centered education. I review the state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrate the technical feasibility of low-cost electroencephalography (EEG) devices and machine learning algorithms that classify cognitive states with high accuracy in controlled settings. Building on this evidence, I outline concrete applications in three dimensions: formative assessment, dynamic curricular adaptation, and cognitive inclusion, with a specific emphasis on preventing dropout in foundational courses such as algorithms. I also examine ethical, technical, and pedagogical challenges, and propose a scalable, ethically grounded pilot model tailored for universities, particularly in Latin America.

      "title": "Humans optimally integrate cutaneous and proprioceptive cues in haptic size perception",
      "content": "Sensory perception relies on the brain's integration of multiple imprecise inputs, a process known as cue combination. Previous research has investigated multisensory integration or unisensory integration within non-haptic senses. In contrast, cue combination within the sense of touch has been understudied. Here, we investigated whether humans optimally combine haptic cutaneous and finger configuration cues when discerning the size of a disk held edge-on between the thumb and index fingers. When these two fingers span the disk to contact its perimeter, a finger configuration cue (the perceived distance between the fingers) provides information about the disk's size. Less obviously, cutaneous cues to disk size may result from the indentation of finger pads caused by the disk's curvature. We considered three hypotheses for how humans might use these cues: they might rely solely on the most reliable cue (Winner-Take-All Model, WTA), combine cues based on a simple arithmetic average (Average Model, AVG), or combine cues via an optimal weighted average (Optimal Model, OPT) in which more reliable cues exert proportionately greater influence on the percept. In three experiments involving 34 participants, we compared participant performance to the predictions of the three models. Each experiment tested participants using a two-interval forced-choice (2IFC) paradigm with 3D printed disk stimuli. On each trial, under occluded vision, participants felt two disks sequentially and responded which felt larger. Participants were tested with the cutaneous index finger cue, cutaneous thumb cue, and finger configuration cue individually and with the three cues together. The three experiments were designed to have progressively greater resolution to distinguish the relevant models from one another. In Experiments 1 and 2, the disks were circular. Experiment 3 included non-circular cue-conflict stimuli. The improvement of accuracy in multi-cue conditions, and perceptual effects of cue-conflict stimuli, were broadly consistent with optimal cue combination. Eight of 12 participants were classified as OPT in Experiment 1; eight of 11 in Experiment 2; and 10 of 11 in Experiment 3. The mean confidence of OPT classifications was 0.56, 0.61, and 0.98, respectively. We conclude that humans combine haptic cues optimally to judge the sizes of held objects.",

      "title": "Non-linearity, complexity, and quantization concepts in biology",
      "content": "Founders of quantum mechanics (QM) anticipated that revisions to classical physics due to strange elements of quantum reality, would necessitate similar changes in biology. Complexity theory, systems biology and quantum biology provide possible solutions indicating that subject/object separation is a useful fiction for reductive science. Direct correlates to such QM observational/measurement issues as Complementarity and Uncertainty may justify the introduction of an analog of Heisenberg's uncertainty and the Planck constant for living systems. The phase space of \u201cadjacent possibles\u201d for biological systems from which one \u201cactual\u201d is selected resembles the collapse of the QM wave function. Since biological systems are hierarchical, this occurs across organizational scales resulting in biological coherence. The location of a quantum/classical boundary is unclear due to complexity. Whether biological systems' characteristics arise directly from QM or are of a different origin remains unsettled. To combine non-linear with quantum properties across biological scales we propose the Method of Coherent Structures (MCS), developed for quantum many-body systems. In MCS, a higher-level scale provides a classical envelope for quantum fluctuations at the lower scale. It yields a seamless transition from non-linear classical fields to quantum excitations and accounts for the emergence of complexity by incorporating metabolic energy supply.",

      "title": "The association of hemoglobin levels and balance function in patients with stroke: a multicenter study in China",
      "content": "BackgroundBalance impairment following stroke is a leading cause of disability and falls. Hemoglobin (Hb) affects systemic and cerebral oxygen delivery and may influence neuromuscular function and post-stroke balance, but evidence from large multicenter clinical samples is limited. We investigated the association between hemoglobin concentration and balance performance in a Chinese multicenter cross-sectional study of stroke patients.MethodsWe studied 2,006 neuroimaging-confirmed stroke patients from 26 hospitals. Balance impairment was defined as BBS\u202f\u2264\u202f40. Admission Hb (g/dL) was analyzed per 1\u202fg/dL and by tertiles (<12.6\u202fg/dL, 12.6\u201314.0\u202fg/dL, \u226514.0\u202fg/dL). Multivariable logistic regression with sequential adjustment, restricted cubic splines, and prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses evaluated associations.ResultsBalance impairment occurred in 70.5% (1,414/2,006). Each 1\u202fg/dL higher Hb was associated with lower odds of impairment in unadjusted (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78\u20130.87; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and fully adjusted models (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83\u20130.96; p\u202f=\u202f0.002). This association remained robust after comprehensive adjustment for demographic, lifestyle, comorbidity, stroke characteristics, and lesion location factors. Compared with the lowest tertile, adjusted ORs were 0.72 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.99; p\u202f=\u202f0.042) for the middle tertile and 0.62 (95% CI 0.45\u20130.85; p\u202f=\u202f0.003) for the highest tertile. Spline analyses suggested a broadly linear inverse association; results were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity checks.ConclusionHigher admission hemoglobin was independently associated with better balance after stroke. Prospective studies should test whether Hb optimization improves rehabilitation outcomes.",

      "content": "Objective. The relationship between swallowing motor imagery (MI) and actual swallowing remains unclear, leading to a lack of physiological basis for the application of swallowing imagery-based brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) paradigms in rehabilitation. This research explored the link between swallowing execution and imagery, aiming to optimize BCI applications for swallowing rehabilitation in patients with dysphagia. Approach. Thirty healthy participants performed swallowing MI and saliva swallowing tasks under video cues, and electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 64 channels and electromyographic (EMG) signals from the suprahyoid muscles were recorded. This study investigates swallowing onset detection using EMG, and explores neural dynamics during swallowing imagery and execution through EEG-based time\u2013frequency analysis, functional connectivity analysis, and nonlinear dynamic analysis (sample entropy (SampEn)). Main Results. The results revealed event-related desynchronization (ERD) in the central region (CPz, CP1\u2013CP4) and parietal region (Pz, P1\u2013P4) for both swallowing MI and actual swallowing. Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis indicated a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0102). The ERD phenomenon during swallowing imagery was more similar to that during the pharyngeal stage, with a weak but significant correlation (P = 0.0139). Functional connectivity analysis revealed greater activation of the central region during swallowing imagery than during actual swallowing. In terms of SampEn, swallowing motor execution exhibited higher signal complexity and dynamic characteristics compared to imagery. Significance. This study highlights the similarity in neural activation between swallowing imagery and execution, particularly in the central and parietal regions, supporting the application of the swallowing imagery paradigm in these regions for rehabilitation. Further research is required to enhance BCI applications in swallowing disorders.",
