      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Brain-immune interactions generate pathogen-specific sickness states",
      "content": "In nature, animals encounter diverse pathogens that trigger specific peripheral defense programs and elicit sickness behavior, a set of stereotyped physiological and behavioral changes thought to promote host fitness. Most studies to date have relied on one or a few mouse models of infection, limiting insights into pathogen-specific neuroimmune interactions that generate sickness. We hypothesized that different pathogens might elicit distinct sickness states by engaging different cell types and brain circuits. Using inflammatory models representing bacterial, viral, allergic, parasitic or colitis conditions, we assessed sickness across scales: organismal (behavior and physiology); cellular (brain-wide neural activity); and molecular (single-cell in situ transcriptomics in hypothalamus areas associated with social and homeostatic functions affected during sickness). Remarkably, immune challenges elicited unique repertoires of changes across all scales. Our findings reveal pathogen-specific sickness states encoded by the brain across scales, thereby broadening our understanding of how infections make us sick.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbance is associated with increased repetitive sensorimotor behaviour in autism but not in learning/intellectual disabilities or ADHD: A comparative study",
      "content": "The interplay of sleep and sensorimotor processing is a fundamental neurobiological process crucial for well-being. Individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism, ADHD, and intellectual/learning disabilities frequently experience both significant sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Although a link between these domains is established, it is unclear whether this relationship and its functional impact are consistent across different neurodevelopmental conditions. In a cross-sectional dataset of individuals aged 5-21 (n = 212), we investigated whether the interplay between sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours differs between individuals diagnosed with autism (IQ>70), ADHD, a learning disability (IQ<70), as well as typically developed controls. We also examined whether interactions between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours predicts distinct functional outcomes between neurodevelopmental groups. We found that individuals with autism (IQ>70) were most strongly affected by both sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Crucially, we show that while a robust bidirectional link between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours exists across the entire sample, sleep problems amplify repetitive sensorimotor behaviours more strongly only in autistic people than in typical controls. Contrary to previous work, we found that learning disabled children and adolescents engaged in more repetitive sensorimotor behaviour but did not experience more sleep disturbance. Although the interaction between sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours did not determine functional outcomes in autistic people, the interplay of sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviour impaired social awareness in people with ADHD. These findings challenge a transdiagnostic view that treats the reinforcement between sleep and sensorimotor problems as a general marker of neurodevelopmental conditions. Understanding the distinct pathways between sleep and waking behaviours is a critical step toward developing personalized, mechanistic interventions targeting specific sleep and sensory impairment profiles in different neurodevelopmental conditions.",
