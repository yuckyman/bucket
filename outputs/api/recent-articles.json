      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

      "title": "A hierarchical Bayesian inference model for volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals",
      "content": "Brain activities often follow an exponential family of distributions. The exponential distribution is the maximum entropy distribution of continuous random variables in the presence of a mean. The memoryless and peakless properties of an exponential distribution impose difficulties for data analysis methods. To estimate the rate parameter of multivariate exponential distribution from a time series of sensory inputs (i.e., observations), we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian inference model based on a variant of general hierarchical Brownian filter (GHBF). To account for the complex interactions among multivariate exponential random variables, the model estimates the second-order interaction of the rate intensity parameter in logarithmic space. Using variational Bayesian scheme, a family of closed-form and analytical update equations are introduced. These update equations also constitute a complete predictive coding framework. The simulation study shows that our model has the ability to evaluate the time-varying rate parameters and the underlying correlation structure of volatile multivariate exponentially distributed signals. The proposed hierarchical Bayesian inference model is of practical utility in analyzing high-dimensional neural activities.",

      "title": "On collective behavior in C. elegans",
      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Introducing Serif: a zero-dependency, vector-first data library for Python",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Since I began in Python, I wanted something simpler and more predictable. Something more &quot;Pythonic&quot; than existing data libraries. Something with vectors as first-class citizens. Something that's more forgiving if you need a for-loop, or you're not familiar with vector semantics. So I wrote Serif. </p> <p>This is an early release (0.1.1), so don't expect perfection, but the core semantics are in place. I'm mainly looking for reactions to how the design feels, and for people to point out missing features or bugs.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Serif is a lightweight vector and table library built around ergonomics and Python-native behavior. Vectors are first-class citizens, tables are simple collections of named columns, and you can use vectorized expressions or ordinary loops depending on what reads best. The goal is to keep the API small, predictable, and comfortable.</p> <p>Serif makes a strategic choice: clarity and workflow ergonomics over raw speed.</p> <pre><code>pip install serif </code></pre> <p>Because it's zero dependency, in a fresh environment:</p> <pre><code>pip freeze # serif==0.1.1 </code></pre> <p><strong>Sample Usage</strong></p> <p>Here\u2019s a short example that shows the basics of working with Serif: clean column names, natural vector expressions, and a simple way to add derived columns:</p> <pre><code>from serif import Table # Create a table with automatic column name sanitization t = Table({ &quot;price ($)&quot;: [10, 20, 30], &quot;quantity&quot;: [4, 5, 6] }) # Add calculated columns with dict syntax t &gt;&gt;= {'total': t.price * t.quantity} t &gt;&gt;= {'tax': t.total * 0.1} t # 'price ($)' quantity total tax # .price .quantity .total .tax # [int] [int] [int] [float] # 10 4 40 4.0 # 20 5 100 10.0 # 30 6 180 18.0 # # 3\u00d74 table &lt;mixed&gt; </code></pre> <p>I also built in a mechanism to discover and access columns interactively via tab completion:</p> <pre><code>from serif import read_csv t = read_csv(&quot;sales.csv&quot;) # Messy column names? No problem. # Discover columns interactively (no print needed!) # t. + [TAB] \u2192 shows all sanitized column names # t.pr + [TAB] \u2192 t.price # t.qua + [TAB] \u2192 t.quantity # Compose expressions naturally total = t.price * t.quantity # Add derived columns t &gt;&gt;= {'total': total} # Inspect (original names preserved in display!) t # 'price ($)' 'quantity' 'total' # .price .quantity .total # 10 4 40 # 20 5 100 # 30 6 180 # # 3\u00d73 table &lt;int&gt; </code></pre> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>People working with \u201cExcel-scale\u201d data (tens of thousands to a few million rows) who want a cleaner, more Pythonic workflow. It's also a good fit for environments that require zero or near-zero dependencies (embedded systems, serverless functions, etc.)</p> <p>This is not aimed at workloads that need to iterate over tens of millions of rows.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Serif is not designed to compete with high-performance engines like pandas or polars. Its focus is clarity and ergonomics, not raw speed. </p> <p><strong>Project</strong></p> <p>Full README and examples <a href=\"https://github.com/CIG-GitHub/serif\">https://github.com/CIG-GitHub/serif</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAerius\"> /u/TheAerius </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj5wdb/introducing_serif_a_zerodependency_vectorfirst/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj5wdb/introducing_serif_a_zerodependency_vectorfirst/\">[comments]</a></span>",

These errors turn into delays and hundreds of thousands of dollars of rework during construction. InspectMind reviews the full drawing set of a construction project in minutes. It cross-checks architecture, engineering, and specifications to catch issues that cause rework before building begins.<p>Here\u2019s a video with some examples: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ</a>.<p>Before this, I (Aakash) built an engineering firm that worked on ~10,000 buildings across the US. One thing that always frustrated us: a lot of design coordination issues don\u2019t show up until construction starts. By then, the cost of a mistake can be 10\u2013100x higher, and everyone is scrambling to fix problems that could have been caught earlier.<p>We tried everything including checklists, overlay reviews, peer checks but scrolling through 500\u20132000 PDF sheets and remembering how every detail connects to every other sheet is a brittle process. City reviewers and GC pre-con teams try to catch issues too, yet they still sneak through.<p>We thought: if models can parse code and generate working software, maybe they can also help reason about the built environment on paper. So we built something we wished we had!<p>You upload drawings and specs (PDFs). The system breaks them into disciplines and detail hierarchies, parses geometry and text, and looks for inconsistencies: - Dimensions that don\u2019t reconcile across sheets; - Clearances blocked by mechanical/architectural elements; - Fire/safety details missing or mismatched; - Spec requirements that never made it into drawings; - Callouts referencing details that don\u2019t exist.<p>The output is a list of potential issues with sheet refs and locations for a human to review. We don\u2019t expect automation to replace design judgment, just to help ACE professionals not miss the obvious stuff. Current AIs are good at obvious stuff, plus can process data at quantities way beyond what humans can accurately do, so this is a good application for them.<p>Construction drawings aren't standardized and every firm names things differently. Earlier \u201cautomated checking\u201d tools relied heavily on manually-written rules per customer, and break when naming conventions change. Instead, we\u2019re using multimodal models for OCR + vector geometry, callout graphs across the entire set, constraint-based spatial checks, and retrieval-augmented code interpretation. No more hard-coded rules!<p>We\u2019re processing residential, commercial, and industrial projects today. Latency ranges from minutes to a few hours depending on sheet count. There\u2019s no onboarding required, simply upload PDFs. There are still lots of edge cases (PDF extraction weirdness, inconsistent layering, industry jargon), so we\u2019re learning a lot from failures, maybe more than successes. But the tech is already delivering results that couldn\u2019t be done with previous tools.<p>Pricing is pay-as-you-go: we give an instant online quote per project after you upload the project drawings. It\u2019s hard to do regular SaaS pricing since one project may be a home remodel and another may be a highrise. We\u2019re open to feedback on that too, we\u2019re still figuring it out.<p>If you work with drawings as an architect, engineer, MEP, GC preconstruction, real estate developer, plan reviewer  we\u2019d love a chance to run a sample set and hear what breaks, what\u2019s useful, and what\u2019s missing!<p>We\u2019ll be here all day to go into technical details about geometry parsing, clustering failures, code reasoning attempts or real-world construction stories about how things go wrong. Thanks for reading! We\u2019re happy to answer anything and look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 4</p>",

      "title": "Chronic semaglutide treatment enhances the incentive motivational value of a small food reward and associated cue in male and female rats",
      "content": "Rationale: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such as semaglutide, are increasingly utilized in clinical practice due to their efficacy in promoting sustained weight loss following chronic administration. While acute treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has been shown to suppress food intake and reward-seeking behaviors in rodent models, the impact of prolonged exposure on preclinical measures of motivated behavior remains insufficiently characterized. Objectives: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of chronic administration of semaglutide on both the acquisition and expression phases of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA), a behavioral paradigm used to assess the attribution of incentive salience to a food-paired cue. The influence of chronic semaglutide on the conditioned reinforcing properties of the food-associated cue, performance on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for food reward, and ad libitum consumption of the food reward were also assessed. Results: Chronic semaglutide administration did not significantly alter either the acquisition or the expression of PavCA behavior. However, relative to vehicle-treated controls, semaglutide markedly enhanced responding for the food-associated cue during a conditioned reinforcement test and increased PR responding for the food reward. In contrast, semaglutide reduced both free consumption of the food reward and homecage chow intake. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that chronic semaglutide administration potentiates the incentive value of food-paired cues and increases motivation for food reward under restricted access conditions, yet attenuates overall food consumption when food is freely available. This dissociation highlights the nuanced effects of semaglutide on motivated behavior and suggests an amplification of the reinforcing properties of discrete, limited food rewards and associated cues.",

      "title": "Neuromuscular Signals Shape Fatigue and Effort-Based Decision-Making in Humans",
      "content": "Physical fatigue influences our willingness to undertake effortful actions, yet the physiological signals driving this process are not well understood. We created a biofeedback paradigm to distinguish the effects of reduced muscle-force capacity from compensatory increases in neuromuscular activity on effort-based decision-making. Human participants made risky choices about prospective physical effort before and after repeated fatiguing exertions under two biofeedback conditions: force biofeedback, which required increased neuromuscular drive, and EMG biofeedback, which constrained the increase in neuromuscular drive. Both biofeedback conditions led to similar reductions in muscle strength and feelings of fatigue. Using computational modeling of choice behavior, however, we found that the Force biofeedback condition, which required compensatory neuromuscular activation, caused a significantly greater increase in the subjective cost of effort than EMG biofeedback. By combining neuromuscular manipulation with computational modeling, our study demonstrates how various physiological processes affect feelings of fatigue and decisions to exert effort in response to fatiguing exertions. These results suggest that fatigue may consist of separate components that collectively serve to motivate behavior while simultaneously protecting and restoring bodily homeostasis amid physical challenge.",

      "title": "Oxytocin enhances excitability and potentiates synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus granule cells",
      "content": "The dentate gyrus is the principal gateway for information into the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus transforms input from the entorhinal cortex into sparse, selective representations that support memory formation. Oxytocin is a key neuromodulator of social behavior and supports social memory through its actions in hippocampal area CA2. However, whether oxytocin also modulates the dentate gyrus (DG), a source of major excitatory input to CA2, remains unclear. We performed whole-cell recordings to test if oxytocin modulated the excitability of mouse dentate gyrus granule cells. We found that bath application of the oxytocin receptor agonist Thy4, Gly7-oxytocin (TGOT) increased DG granule cell excitability by depolarizing the resting membrane potential, increasing input resistance, and hyperpolarizing action potential threshold. In addition to increasing postsynaptic excitability, we found that TGOT decreased the paired-pulse ratio of perforant path to granule cell synapses and also increased the frequency, without an effect on amplitude, of miniature EPSCs suggesting that TGOT increased the probability of glutamate release. Notably, long-term potentiation induced by theta-burst pairing occluded the effect of TGOT on synaptic strength suggesting that oxytocin and long-term potentiation may converge on common downstream mechanisms. Our results revealed a previously uncharacterized role for oxytocin in regulating the relay of information between the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus. This suggests a potential mechanism through which oxytocin shapes hippocampal processing of socially relevant stimuli.",

      "title": "Microstructural correlates of white and gray matter in the healthy human brain: comparative analysis of diffusion biophysical models, inhomogeneous magnetization transfer, and macromolecular proton fraction",
      "content": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) and magnetization transfer (MT) rely on distinct biophysical principles and provide complementary insights into tissue microstructure. In this study, we investigated associations between microstructural metrics derived from the Standard Model (SMI) in white matter (WM) and the Standard Model with EXchange (SMEX/NEXI) in gray matter (GM) with two MT measures differing in specificity and sensitivity to myelination: the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) and the inhomogeneous magnetization transfer ratio (ihMTR). Measurements were performed in WM and GM in ten healthy subjects scanned at 3T. In WM, the strongest significant association was observed between ihMTR and the axonal water fraction, consistent with higher myelination in regions of elevated axonal density and limited extra-axonal space. This correlation exceeded that of MPF, supporting the greater specificity of ihMTR to myelin. Interestingly, ihMTR displayed a gradient along the longitudinal axis of the corpus callosum, in agreement with previous histology measurements. Correlation between ihMTR and the extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivity (De{perp}), a putative myelination biomarker, was not significant, whereas MPF and De{perp} exhibited a moderate significant positive correlation. Since a negative correlation is expected if reflecting myelination, these results suggest that in healthy tissue De{perp} is mainly influenced by microstructural factors like fiber coherence and packing, the latter most likely affecting MPF but not ihMTR. In GM, ihMTR correlated significantly only with the exchange time (t), confirming tex as a proxy for cell membrane permeability modulated by myelin. MPF correlated exclusively with the cell-process fraction (f), suggesting the latter is modulated by total (neuronal and glial) cell membrane density. Overall, findings underscore the complementary and concurring microstructural information captured by these metrics, highlighting their potential to disentangle distinct tissue mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. Future studies incorporating ground-truth histology should validate the precise sensitivity of each metric to various microstructural tissue features.",
