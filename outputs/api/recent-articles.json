      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m a B.Pharm 3rd-year student, but I actually got into coding back in my 1st year (2023). At first Python felt amazing I loved learning new concepts. But when topics like OOP and dictionaries came in, I suddenly felt like maybe I wasn\u2019t good enough. Still, I pushed through and finished the course. Later we shifted to a new place, far from the institute. My teacher there was great he even asked why I chose pharmacy over programming. I told him the truth: I tried for NEET, didn\u2019t clear it due to lack of interest and my own fault to avoid studies during that time, so I chose B.Pharm while doing Python on the side. He appreciated that. But now the problem is whenever college exams come, I have to stop coding. And every time I return, my concepts feel weak again, so I end up relearning things. This keeps repeating. Honestly, throughout my life, I\u2019ve never really started something purely out of interest or finished it properly except programming. Python is the only thing I genuinely enjoy, Now I\u2019m continuing programming as a hobby growing bit by bit and even getting better in my studies. But sometimes I still think if I should keep going or just let it go. I'm planning first to complete my course then focus completely on my dream.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ToKnowTheWorldBetter\"> /u/ToKnowTheWorldBetter </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p8155t/need_a_suggestion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p8155t/need_a_suggestion/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This release wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Cary, our new co-maintainer. He picked up my unfinished workspaces branch and made it production-ready, added SBOM support to Hatchling, and landed a bunch of PRs from contributors!</p> <p>My motivation took a big hit last year, in large part due to improper use of social media: I simply didn\u2019t realize that continued mass evangelism is required nowadays. This led to some of our novel features being attributed to other tools when in fact Hatch was months ahead. I\u2019m sorry to say that this greatly discouraged me and I let it affect maintenance. I tried to come back on several occasions but could only make incremental progress on the workspaces branch because I had to relearn the code each time. I\u2019ve been having to make all recent releases from a branch based on an old commit because there were many prerequisite changes that were merged and couldn\u2019t be released as is.</p> <p>No more of that! Development will be much more rapid now, even better than the way it used to be.
