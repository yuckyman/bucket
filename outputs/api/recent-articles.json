      "title": "Object speed and distractor number do not affect attentional allocation in multiple object tracking",
      "content": "Keeping track of multiple moving objects across dynamic real-world scenarios such as driving, team sports, or crowded social environments is a fundamental challenge for visual attention. We have previously demonstrated that as the number of tracked objects increases, the strength of attentional facilitation allocated to each individual object decreases, limiting tracking success. It is also well established that beyond the number of tracked objects, faster-moving objects and objects embedded among higher numbers of distractors are more di[ffi]cult to track. Are these e[ff]ects on tracking di[ffi]culty also mediated by less e[ff]ective allocation of attention to tracked targets as in the case of tracking more targets? If so, one should expect the strength of attentional modulation to drop systematically with increasing speed and total number of moving stimuli. In two experiments (total n = 70), participants were instructed to track moving targets among identical distractors while we manipulated object speed (Experiment 1) and number (Experiment 2). As expected, tracking performance declined with both manipulations. However, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) recorded during successful tracking revealed that attentional enhancement of tracked targets compared with distractors did not drop with increasing speed or object number. In summary, bottom-up changes in the stimulus display and top-down attentional manipulations a[ff]ect tracking performance in independent ways, with the balance between strength of attentional allocation and bottom-up demands of the task determining successful tracking. The allocation of attention itself seems to be determined exclusively by top-down goals rather than being reactive to bottom-up display characteristics.",

      "title": "Envelope analysis as a tool for identifying epileptic EEG patterns during the sleep-wake cycle in rats",
      "content": "Background: This research aimed to study electroencephalographic abnormalities in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by pilocarpine. By using the coefficient of variation of the envelope (CVE) of electroencephalography (EEG), we characterize and quantify morphological alterations in sleep-wake cycle (SWC) stages. Methods: Epilepsy was induced in 13 rats using a single dose of intraperitoneal pilocarpine injection. A second group of 13 rats served as the control. All the rats underwent polysomnography for at least two days. To do so, three channels were created using four electrodes for EEG and one more for EMG. Channels were built using contralateral lead. Results: Envelope analysis revealed global alterations in EEG morphology. Significant differences were observed in the delta and theta bands between the epileptic and control groups. Epileptic animals showed a near-total suppression of theta rhythm activity during REM sleep. Additionally, we identified a novel pattern of synchronized slow waves (sDelta), distinct from the physiological delta waves observed in non-REM sleep. Conclusion: Identifying both subtle and overt morphological abnormalities in EEG is challenging for human experts and computational methods. By applying CVE analysis to the well-known pilocarpine model, we reveal abnormal EEG dynamics with exceptional summarizing capabilities. For example, a 24-hour EEG can be synthesized into a single, easily interpretable visualization of EEG morphology. This technique and its underlying framework may serve as valuable tools for epilepsy research and potential diagnostic applications.",

      "title": "Sulfate reducing bacteria induce \u03b1-synuclein in intestinal and neuronal cells and tissues and inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase in neuronal cells",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD), a synucleopathy characterized by the presence of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates in the brain, is thought to originate in the intestine. Desulfovibrio, resident gut sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), usually found in very low numbers in a healthy gut, are found in higher numbers in PD. In a recent study, a separate group demonstrated that Desulfovibrio isolated from both PD patients and healthy subjects were fed to C. elegans and were found to increase \u03b1-syn aggregates in the head region of the worms. How these bacteria induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain through the gut remain unknown. We tested whether Desulfovibrio induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in the intestinal cells and triggered \u03b1-syn secretion from these cells into the growth medium and whether this growth medium (devoid of bacteria) further induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio directly induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neuronal cells and inhibited protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key dopamine-producing enzyme. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio increased \u03b1-syn levels in intestine, plasma, and in brain in mice.MethodsEnteroendocrine STC-1 and neuronal SH-Sy5y cells were infected with Desulfovibriovulgaris (DSV). We measured \u03b1-syn aggregation by immunofluorescence. \u03b1-syn levels in cell culture supernatant (sup), tissues, and plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein expression of TH and \u03b1-syn was analyzed by Western blot.ResultsWe found that DSV increased the number of STC-1cells with \u03b1-syn aggregates and also induced \u03b1-syn expression in these cells. Sup from DSV-infected STC-1 had higher \u03b1-syn levels compared to control uninfected sup and could induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in SH-Sy5y. DSV also directly induced a syn aggregates and inhibited TH in SH-Sy5y. DSV-gavaged mice had higher levels of \u03b1-syn in the duodenum, plasma, and in brain and also showed a decreasing trend in TH expression in the brain.ConclusionThus, our findings provide a gut-to-brain link tied to the ability of SRB in the gut-to increase expression, aggregation and spread of \u03b1-syn and decrease of TH in PD.",

      "content": "<p>I am a college student and for my entire life I have been lonely. This is probably taken a very heavy toll on my mental health but that\u2019s another story. I\u2019ve never been able to make friends and keep meaningful connections that last a long time. In fact I\u2019d go as far as saying I have never had a friend, and I currently don\u2019t have any. My phone is empty, when I go to school nobody talks to me and when I do find people who seem to have some kind of interest in me, it usually doesn\u2019t last very long since they don\u2019t prioritize whatever we have. As far as I\u2019m aware I am tolerable to be around. People find me funny and when I do talk to people we have decent conversations (though small talk tends to bore me). However that doesn\u2019t lead anywhere and doesn\u2019t bring me any kind of comfort or fulfillment. I\u2019ve attributed my lack of friends to something that places all the blame on me. Maybe I\u2019m ugly, maybe I\u2019m not funny enough, maybe I\u2019m dumb. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right approach. But I\u2019ve tried so many different things, I\u2019ve read so many different books and yet I still can\u2019t get anyone to even bother to ask me how my day was or care to actually do something and hang out with me when I ask if they\u2019d like too.<p>What am I supposed to do?

      "title": "Integrated auditory-vocal embodied training for expressive authentic intonation in Chinese zither performance",
      "content": "BackgroundChinese zither music relies on culturally specific microtones (e. g., FA+ and TI\u2013) that differ from Western equal temperament, yet prolonged exposure to standardized tuning often leads to the erosion of these traditional intonation practices. While embodied cognition theory emphasizes the role of sensorimotor integration in learning, its application to the acquisition of non-fixed pitch systems in intangible cultural heritage music remains underexplored.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether a structured auditory-vocal embodied training protocol\u2014integrating listening, vocal imitation, and metaphoric gestures\u2014could enhance zither learners' accuracy in producing traditional microtones, and to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of embodied cognition theory in sustaining culturally authentic musical intonation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design was employed with 63 intermediate-level zither students. Participants were assigned to an experimental group, which completed a 1-week auditory-vocal-gestural training program, or a control group, which continued regular practice without multimodal integration. Pitch accuracy on two critical tones (FA+ and TI\u2013) was assessed through pre- and post-tests.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Chinese-style pitch accuracy compared to the control group, along with a marked shift in intonation perception away from equal-tempered biases.ConclusionThe findings indicate that multisensory embodied training, grounded in the principles of perceptual-motor coupling and gestural simulation, effectively promotes the internalization of traditional microtonal intonation. This study not only offers a novel pedagogical approach for preserving intangible cultural heritage in music education but also substantiates the role of embodied cognition in acquiring culturally situated sensorimotor skills.",

      "title": "Automated brain atrophy quantification from clinical MRI predicts early neurological deterioration in anterior choroidal artery territory infarction",
      "content": "BackgroundEarly neurological deterioration (END) occurs in 43%\u201360% of patients with anterior choroidal artery (AChA) territory infarction. While brain atrophy serves as an imaging biomarker of diminished brain reserve capacity and may influence stroke outcomes, its predictive value for END in AChA infarction remains unclear.MethodsThis dual-center retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with acute AChA territory infarction admitted to two Chinese stroke centers between September 2018 and September 2024. Clinical T1-weighted images were reconstructed into standardized high-resolution images using the SynthSR deep learning algorithm, followed by fully automated brain tissue segmentation via AssemblyNet. We calculated gray matter fraction (GMF), white matter fraction (WMF), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), and cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) to quantify brain atrophy severity. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to assess associations between brain atrophy metrics and END.ResultsAmong 206 enrolled patients, 78 (37.86%) developed END. Patients with END demonstrated significantly greater brain atrophy: GMF (P < 0.001), WMF (P < 0.001), and BPF (P < 0.001) were all significantly reduced, while CSFF was correspondingly elevated (P < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, each 0.01-unit increase in WMF was associated with a 58% reduction in END risk (P < 0.001); each 0.01-unit increase in BPF corresponded to a 32% risk reduction (P = 0.002); and each 0.01-unit increase in CSFF was associated with a 52% increase in risk (P < 0.001). Quartile analysis confirmed dose-response relationships: the highest quartiles of WMF and BPF were associated with 91% and 74% reductions in END risk, respectively, while the highest CSFF quartile conferred a 6.2-fold increased risk. RCS analysis confirmed significant linear dose-response relationships between both BPF and CSFF with END (both P-non-linear > 0.05).ConclusionAutomated brain atrophy quantification based on routine clinical MRI can independently predict END risk in patients with AChA infarction, providing a feasible imaging biomarker for this high-risk stroke population and facilitating early risk stratification and treatment optimization.",

      "title": "Multimodal management of a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with stereotactic drainage, targeted antimicrobial therapy, and early neurorehabilitation: a case report",
      "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",
