      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "title": "Mirror manifolds: partially overlapping neural subspaces for speaking and listening",
      "content": "Participants in conversations need to associate words their speakers but also retain those words general meanings. For example, someone talking about their hand is not referring to the other speakers hand, but the word hand still carries speaker-general information (e.g., having five fingers). These two requirements impose a cross-speaker generalization / differentiation dilemma that is not well addressed by existing theories. We hypothesized that the brain resolves the dilemma by use of a vectorial semantic code that blends collinear and orthogonal coding subspaces. To test this hypothesis, we examined semantic encoding in populations of hippocampal single neurons recorded during conversations between epilepsy patients and healthy partners in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU). We found clear semantic encoding for both spoken and heard words, with strongest encoding just around the time of utterance for production, and just after it for reception. Crucially, hippocampal neurons codes for word meaning were poised between orthogonalized and collinearized. Moreover, different semantic categories were orthogonalized to different degrees; body parts and names were most differentiated between speakers; function words and verbs were least differentiated. Finally, the hippocampus used the same coding principle to separate different partners in three-person conversations, with greater orthogonalization between self and other than between two others. Together, these results suggest a new solution to the problem of binding word meanings with speaker identity.",

      "title": "Subclinical anxiety is associated with reduced self-distancing and enhanced guilt-related connectivity between anterior temporal and subgenual cingulate cortices",
      "content": "Excessive self-blaming emotions are commonly observed in anxiety disorders, with mounting evidence indicating the presence of qualitatively similar symptomatology in subclinical and clinical populations. Prior work points to a central role of the superior anterior temporal lobe (sATL) in the guilt processing circuitry, together with network organisation differences associated with subclinical anxiety. This study aimed to extend these findings by exploring links of trait-anxiety with (i) self-blaming emotions and associated behaviours, and (ii) guilt-dependent neural activity and connectivity. We also explored the role of resting-state fMRI in linking these phenomena. Increased anxiety was linked to stronger self-blaming emotions, and more pronounced self-attacking and hiding. When experiencing negative emotions about themselves (i.e. shame and self-anger), anxious individuals were also less likely to disengage from self-focused thoughts. These behavioural findings were paralleled by enhanced guilt-related connectivity between the left sATL and bilateral posterior subgenual cingulate cortex. The relevance of temporal lobe activity for self-blaming emotions was also evident in the resting-state data. Interestingly, while the approach-avoidance motivation towards guilt memories was unrelated to anxiety, this emotional dimension showed distinct contributions of the left and right sATL, with task-related activity of the former and connectivity of the latter associated with, respectively, more approach and avoidance. As such, the results of the current study link the self-blaming bias of anxious individuals to specific maladaptive patterns of behaviour. Furthermore, the work provides robust evidence for the important role of ATL-related circuitry in guilt processing, supporting its broader involvement in social conceptual processing.",

      "title": "BAG3 coordinates astrocytic proteostasis of Alzheimer's disease-linked proteins via proteasome, autophagy, and retromer complex interactions",
      "content": "Background: Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is a mediator of chaperone assisted selective autophagy, and in the brain, most highly expressed in astrocytes. However, its role in astrocytes remains poorly defined. Given the genetic and pathological links of BAG3 to proteostasis and neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated how BAG3 contributes to astrocyte function and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: SnRNA-seq of the human brain determined cell type expression of BAG3. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human iPSCs, followed by tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry and RNA-sequencing was performed to assess proteomic and transcriptomic changes following BAG3 loss. Co-immunoprecipitation of BAG3 in human astrocytes defined the interactome, with top interactors being validated by western blot (WB), AlphaFold modeling, and proximity ligation assays. In astrocytes, autophagic flux, lysosomal phenotypes, proteasome activity, and endocytic uptake were measured in BAG3 KO and BAG3 WT. Finally, BAG3 expression was assessed in postmortem AD brain by WB and snRNA-seq, and its functional relevance to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) degradation was tested in co-cultures of BAG3 KO iAs with familial AD neurons. Results: In human brain and iPSC models, BAG3 was most highly expressed in astrocytes. Further, BAG3 loss caused greater proteomic disruption in astrocytes than in neurons. In the absence of BAG3, astrocytes showed reduced autophagy, diminished lysosome abundance and activity, and decreased proteasome function. To uncover molecular binding partners of BAG3 that might influence these phenotypes, we performed co-immunoprecipitation, revealing interactions with HSPB8 and other heat shock proteins, proteasome regulators (PSMD5, PSMF1), and the retromer component, VPS35. Integration of BAG3 KO transcriptomic and proteomic datasets pinpointed AD-relevant proteins under post-translational control of BAG3, which included GFAP, BIN1, and HSPB8. HSPB8 levels were markedly reduced in BAG3-deficient astrocytes with overexpression partially rescuing its levels. Loss of astrocytic BAG3 impaired A{beta} clearance in co-culture with APP/PSEN1 mutant neurons, directly linking BAG3 to a disease-relevant astrocyte function. Finally, analysis of postmortem brain tissue revealed BAG3 marks a stress-responsive astrocyte subtype in the brain of aged individuals with AD. Conclusions: BAG3 binds to key regulators of autophagy, proteasome activity, and retromer function to coordinate astrocyte proteostasis, lysosomal function, and A{beta} clearance. These findings position BAG3 as a potential therapeutic target and coordinator of glial protein quality control in neurodegeneration.",

      "title": "The effect of quercetin on the fluorescent intensity of neurofibrillary tangles that correspond to Alzheimers disease within Drosophila melanogaster",
      "content": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that accounts for more than 60% of all dementia cases, and over seven million Americans above 65 years old were affected with AD in 2024 (Gaugler et al., 2024). A symptom of AD is severe memory loss, which leads to lowered brain function and a need for intensive care. Currently, AD only has five symptomatic approved drugs. However, there is a lack of research in the progression of AD through the neurofibrillary tangle mechanism. Tau is a microtubule stabilizing protein that becomes unstable when hyperphosphorylated. Hyperphosphorylated tau misfolds, resulting in toxic aggregates that accumulate to create neurofibrillary tangles. Saffron decreased tau fibrillation, neurotoxicity and slowed the neurofibrillary tangle formation (Patel et al., 2024). Therefore, quercetin, an antioxidant present in saffron, was hypothesized to reduce the intensity of the neurofibrillary tangles within Drosophila melanogaster , commonly known as the fruit fly, exhibiting AD. Drosophila melanogaster has easily modifiable genes and shares a similar genetic sequence with humans, which is ideal to research if the effect of a supplement in flies could have a similar effect on humans. This study found that quercetin had no significant effect on the intensity of the neurofibrillary tangles within Drosophila melanogaster . The ANOVA statistical test showcased that the p-value was above 0.05 between flies exhibiting AD and flies exhibiting AD with supplemented quercetin. Possible error sources include the fluorescence of brain tissue present and the large constant areameasured for each brain image.",

Free, online webinar platforms offer a powerful way to democratize scientific knowledge and support career development globally. Drawing from our experience building Open Box Science \u2014 a not-for-profit grassroots organization that has hosted over 250 webinars for audiences from more than 70 countries \u2014 and examining other successful initiatives, we share practical insights on how to build thriving communities for scientific exchange and call for the continuous support of such platforms. We also highlight how early-career scientists can leverage such platforms to expand their network and enrich their perspectives.",
