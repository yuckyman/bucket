      "title": "Visual features underlying neural selectivity for natural stimuli",
      "content": "Neural activity is selective for the identity and semantic category of natural visual stimuli. In human neuroimaging, this selectivity can be investigated using multivariate pattern analysis. The resulting neural information is thought to reflect neural processes underlying object recognition. However, due to the complexity of natural stimuli, it remains unclear to what extent different visual features drive this information. To address this, we presented natural stimuli from different categories as well as several degraded versions, in which specific visual features were selectively manipulated, to human participants while recording magnetoencephalography (MEG). We applied multivariate pattern analysis and decomposed the resulting high-dimensional neural representational geometry into its distinct contributions from retinotopy, total spatial frequency and orientation energy, global shape, local shape, and textural correlation structure. These features contributed differentially to the neural information, with retinotopy and global shape being the strongest features underlying image and category information, respectively. Our results demonstrate how multiple statistical features of visual stimuli jointly and dynamically account for neural image and category selectivity, providing a basis for a better understanding of human object recognition.",

      "content": "<p>I built Jottings because I was tired of my own thoughts getting trapped inside algorithmic feeds where I had to perform. There was a huge mental load before posting something on X or Instagram.<p>Every time I wanted to share something small or unfinished, I opened Twitter and lost 20 minutes to the timeline. Writing a blog post felt too heavy for those smaller, quick thoughts. I just wanted a place to write something down quickly and hit publish.<p>Jottings is that place. It gives you a clean microblog on a domain you own. Posts show up in simple chronological order. No likes. No followers. No feed trying to decide what matters.<p>What Jottings is\n- A microblogging platform that builds fully static microblog sites\n- A free subdomain (you.jottings.me) or connect your own domain on PRO plans\n- Markdown, tags, RSS feed, links with preview, and image uploads\n- An optional AI writing helper when you are stuck or lazy to fix grammar\n- Optimized for SEO and AI search friendly\n- Analytics for your sites<p>What it is not\n- Not a social network\n- Not an engagement funnel\n- Not trying to keep you on the site\n- Not a replacement for long-form blogging, though you can use it that way<p>How it works\nEach Jot publish triggers a static site rebuild. The site is stored in Cloudflare R2 and served directly at the edge. Custom domains go through Cloudflare SSL for SaaS.\nI built it to be boring, reliable (barring Cloudflare's latest issues), and cheap to run.<p>Pricing\nFree tier for a subdomain, text posts, and a lot more.\nUSD5 per month for custom domains, images, full Markdown, and the writing helper.\nI priced it to be an easy yes.<p>Limitations\n- No comments (on purpose)\n- No native apps yet (iOS is coming)\n- The writing helper is helpful but not magic\n- I am a solo founder, so features move at human speed<p>I use Jottings regularly to document what I build. It has been the lowest-friction way I have found to publish anything publicly.<p>Demo of Jottings site for product updates: <a href=\"https://jottings.jottings.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.jottings.me/</a>\nDemo of my personal Jottings site: <a href=\"https://jottings.vishalvshekkar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.vishalvshekkar.com</a> (with custom subdomain)<p>I would love feedback from this community. What would make this better or more useful for you?<p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://jottings.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jottings.me</a> (2 min set up)\nFeel free to write to me at vishal@vishalvshekkar.com<p>\u2014 Vishal</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242071\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242071</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
