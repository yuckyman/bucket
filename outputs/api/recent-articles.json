      "title": "Dentate spikes comprise a continuum of relative input strength from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex.",
      "content": "Hippocampal dentate spikes (DS) are synchronous population events generated in the dentate gyrus thought to support memory processing. DS are classified into type 1 (DS1) and type 2 (DS2) based on current sinks in the outer or middle molecular layer, where the axons of the lateral or medial entorhinal cortex terminate, respectively. This widely used classification method constrains DS into a bimodal distribution without properly testing whether such constraint is appropriate. Here we utilized silicon probe recordings with high spatial resolution spanning all layers of the dentate gyrus and discovered that the contribution of LEC/MEC inputs to DS follows a continuous distribution. We introduce a third type (DS3) that captures a previously unreported component of the distribution: simultaneous current sinks in the outer/middle molecular layer, suggestive of synchronized activation from the LEC/MEC which could facilitate binding. We verify DS3 in several data sets from independent laboratories and characterize their brain state dependence and neural recruitment.",

      "title": "Voice Changes in Aging Birdsong: A Longitudinal Study in Adult Male Zebra Finches",
      "content": "By 2030, 1.4 billion people worldwide will be 60 years or older. A significant proportion will experience changes in voice, which can indicate early signs of neurodegenerative disease. Most research and treatment studies have focused on the larynx because of its accessibility and known role in moderating pitch, loudness, and voice quality. Pre-clinical animal models offer important insight into brain mechanisms involved in aging vocalizations. Previously, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis in adult male zebra finches, discovering that song changes occur at transitional timepoints, between young adult, middle age, and older ages. Song changes are accompanied by re-organization of gene networks in a song-dedicated basal ganglia brain nucleus at middle age that degrade in old age. To more precisely examine how aging alters songs during these transitional timepoints, we followed individual male zebra finches longitudinally over adulthood. Measurements of aging human voice, including duration, intensity, smoothed cepstral peak prominence, and fundamental frequency (fo mean, median, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation), were carried out on birdsong syllables. Our results show that changes in fo mean and intensity are the measurements most sensitive to aging and consistent across multiple mornings in the finches. Notably, acoustic changes were also more pronounced in the transition from young adult to middle age, a time at which changes in aging voice also emerge. Our findings strengthen the validity of the finch model for use in aging research and motivate future investigations exploring the relative contributions of laryngeal and brain mechanisms to aging vocalizations.",

      "title": "Advancing epileptic seizure recognition through bidirectional LSTM networks",
      "content": "Seizure detection in a timely and accurate manner remains a primary challenge in clinical neurology, affecting diagnosis planning and patient management. Most of the traditional methods rely on feature extraction and traditional machine learning techniques, which are not efficient in capturing the dynamic characteristics of neural signals. It is the aim of this study to address such limitations by designing a deep learning model from bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks in a bid to enhance epileptic seizure identification reliability and accuracy. The dataset used, drawn from Kaggle\u2019s Epileptic Seizure Recognition challenge, consists of 11,500 samples with 179 features per sample corresponding to different electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. Data preprocessing was utilized to normalize and structure the input to the deep learning model. The proposed BiLSTM model employs sophisticated architecture to leverage temporal dependency and bidirectional data flows. It incorporates multiple dense and dropout layers alongside batch normalization to enhance the capability of the model in learning from the EEG data in an efficient manner. It supports end-to-end feature learning from the raw EEG signals without the need for intensive preprocessing and feature engineering. BiLSTM model performed better than others with 98.70% accuracy on the validation set and surpassed traditional techniques. The F1-score and other statistical metrics also validated the performance of the model as the confusion matrix achieved high values for recall and precision. The results confirm the capability of bidirectional LSTM networks to better identify seizures with significant improvements over conventional practices. Apart from facilitating seizure detection in a reliable fashion, the method improves the overall field of biomedical signal processing and can also be used in real-time observation and intervention protocols.",
