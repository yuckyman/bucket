      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "ACC Reward Location Information Is Carried by Hippocampal Theta Synchrony and Suppressed in a Type 2 Diabetes Model",
      "content": "<p>The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for higher-order cognitive functions, emotional responses, and monitoring internal states. ACC dysfunction has been implicated in an array of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders which have a bidirectional relationship with the metabolic disorder Type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, loss of insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, and increased morbidity and mortality chances. To better understand the functional effects of T2D on ACC information processing, we delivered an intermittent, low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) protocol to rats (all male due to female insensitivity to STZ) which led to lasting hyperglycemia and recorded single neurons during a delayed alternation task. We observed changes in spatial and reward processing in spite of no differences in overall behavioral accuracy, though we did find hyperglycemic animals spent less time at the reward site. Hyperglycemic animal (<i>n</i> = 5) ACC neurons had higher spatial information scores and changes in the allotment of spatial coding assets. Specifically, the hyperglycemic group had greatest spatial information during the reward approach, while in controls (<i>n</i> = 3) it was uniformly distributed. We found that state space separation and decoding accuracy were greater in control ensembles at the reward location. Furthermore, control hippocampal theta phase-locked cells had the strongest reward coding, and this effect was absent in hyperglycemic animals, leading to a muted reward location representation, despite increased reward approach coding. T2D inferred a nuanced and layered effect on ACC activity, leading to reward coding deficits, a reduced post-reinforcement pause, and a differential change in spatial coding properties.</p>",

      "title": "High Beta Power in the Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex Indexes Human Approach Behavior: A Case Study",
      "content": "<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule and ventral striatum (VC/VS) is an effective therapy for treatment-resistant obsessive&ndash;compulsive disorder (trOCD). DBS initiation often produces acute improvements in mood and energy. These acute behavioral changes, which we refer to as \"approach behaviors,\" include increased social engagement and talkativeness. We investigated the relationship between stimulation amplitude, spectral power in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and speech rate in one male patient with trOCD implanted with bilateral VC/VS DBS leads and subdural electrodes adjacent to the orbitofrontal cortex and vlPFC. Several times over the first 24&nbsp;weeks of therapy, we conducted experiments where we recorded data during epochs of high-amplitude or zero-/low-amplitude stimulation. We found that both the speech rate and vlPFC power in a high beta frequency band (31 &plusmn; 1.5&nbsp;Hz, 1/<i>f</i> activity removed) increased during high-amplitude as compared with low-amplitude periods. The speech rate correlated with vlPFC high beta power. These effects were more consistent across time points in the left hemisphere than the right. At Week 24, we performed an experiment where stimulation was held constant, while the patient was asked to speak or remain silent. We showed that the presence or absence of speech was not sufficient to increase the vlPFC high beta power, suggesting stimulation is a key driver of the observed neurobehavioral phenomenon. Our results suggest vlPFC high beta power is a biomarker for approach behaviors associated with VC/VS DBS.</p>",

      "content": "<p>To build an understanding of our world, we make inferences about the connections between our actions, experiences, and the environment. This process, state inference, requires an agent to guess the current state of the world given a set of observations. During value-based decision-making, a growing body of evidence implicates the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) in the process of contextualizing information and identifying links between stimuli, actions, and outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms driving these processes in primates remain unknown. To investigate how OFC and HPC contribute to state inference, we recorded simultaneously from both regions while two male monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) performed a probabilistic reversal learning task, where reward contingencies could be captured by two task states. Using population-level decoding, we found neural representations of task state in both OFC and HPC that remained stable within each trial but strengthened with learning as monkeys adapted to reversals. Subjects also appeared to use their understanding of task structure to anticipate reversals, evidenced by anticipatory neural representations of the upcoming task state.</p>",

      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "title": "Reconstructing high-resolution visual perceptual images from human intracranial electrocorticography signals",
      "content": "Objectives. Reconstruction of visual perception from brain signals has emerged as a promising research topic. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",
