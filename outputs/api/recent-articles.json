      "title": "Pre-stimulus pupil-linked arousal enhances initial stimulus availability and accelerates decay in iconic memory.",
      "content": "Pupil diameter reflects not only reflexive responses to light but also spontaneous fluctuations in arousal. Such pre-stimulus fluctuations may shape visual performance, yet it remains unclear whether they only affect perceptual sensitivity or decision processes in near-threshold tasks, or instead influence the temporal availability of sensory information even for highly visible stimuli. We tested whether pupil-linked arousal modulates iconic memory, a high-capacity but short-lived visual store bridging sensory encoding and short-term memory. Based on a model in which a brief stimulus evokes an internal response decaying over a few hundred milliseconds, we hypothesized that increased arousal enhances performance either by amplifying the initial response or by slowing its decay. Thirty-seven participants viewed brief displays of six oriented stimuli, followed by a cue after a variable stimulus-cue onset asynchrony indicating which item to report. Pre-stimulus pupil diameter was continuously recorded, and behavioral data were fitted with an exponential decay function estimating initial stimulus availability, decay rate, and asymptotic performance. Larger pre-stimulus pupil dilation was associated with higher initial stimulus availability but faster decay of the iconic trace, while information transferred into short-term memory and confidence ratings remained unaffected. These findings demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations in arousal shape the temporal dynamics of sensory persistence. Elevated arousal boosts the initial strength of visual representations but shortens their duration, suggesting that arousal adaptively prioritizes rapid updating of visual input over prolonged stability.",

      "title": "From Perception to Appraisal: Hierarchical Brain Responses to Natural and Built Features in Urban Environments",
      "content": "Exposure to urban rather than natural environments has been linked to elevated stress and diminished well-being, prompting interest in the underlying mechanisms and influences of specific urban elements. This study investigated how semantic and lower-level visual characteristics of urban scenes influence subjective experience and underlying neural processes. A total of 63 adults viewed street-level photographs depicting Berlin environments with varying proportions of vegetation, buildings, vehicles, and sky visibility while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Subjective ratings indicated that urban scenes with more greenery compared to built elements were consistently perceived as more positive. In terms of lower-level image features, images with higher non-straight edge density also led to scenes being perceived as more positive. In contrast, more visible sky area and a higher mean metric depth led to more negative scene appraisal. On a neural level, urban scenes with higher greenery/built ratios enhanced visual evoked P1 amplitudes, while higher straight-edge density led to more pronounced N1 amplitudes. Further analysis showed that later P3 and LPP components predicted subjective ratings on higher-level evaluative but not basic affective dimensions. These results partially replicate previous studies, suggesting that urban greenery exerts an effect on subjective well-being and influences early visual processing. Moving forward, neurourbanism research should employ more diversified stimuli and leverage immersive or in situ paradigms to refine our understanding of the relationship between greenery in urban environments and well-being to inform evidence-based urban design strategies.",

      "title": "lncRNA 3222401L13Rik/ENSG00000272070 modulates microglial inflammatory programs in association with PU.1",
      "content": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of brain function, but their contribution to microglial aging and neurodegenerative disease remains largely unknown. Because only 1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins, whereas the vast majority of transcripts belong to the largely unexplored non-coding RNAome, elucidating the functions of non-coding RNAs provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the space for therapeutic discovery. We recently identified the glia-enriched lncRNA 3222401L13Rik as upregulated in the aging mouse hippocampus. Here, we investigated its function in microglia and its human homolog ENSG00000272070. We found that 3222401L13Rik is expressed in both astrocytes and microglia and increases with age. Knockdown of 3222401L13Rik in primary microglia led to enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFalpha, and increased phagocytic activity. RNA sequencing revealed widespread transcriptional changes enriched for TNF and complement signaling pathways. The human homolog ENSG00000272070 showed conserved functions in iPSC-derived microglia, where its loss similarly promoted inflammatory gene expression and phagocytosis. Mechanistically, 3222401L13Rik interacts with the microglial transcription factor PU.1, and its depletion overlapped with PU.1-driven transcriptional programs. Consistent with these findings, ENSG00000272070 expression was significantly reduced in postmortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and AD-associated genes were enriched among 3222401L13Rik-regulated targets. Together, our results identify 3222401L13Rik/ENSG00000272070 as a conserved, aging-associated lncRNA that modulates microglial inflammatory states through interaction with PU.1. This work links glial lncRNA regulation to AD-related neuroinflammation and suggests 3222401L13Rik as a potential molecular target to fine-tune microglial activity in neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Competition Between Memory Updating and Differentiation Emerges from Intrinsic Network Dynamics",
      "content": "When an event occurs that is similar to a previous experience, the original episodic memory can be modified with new information (updating) or a new memory can be encoded (differentiation). Prediction errors, the deviation between expected and actual stimuli, are believed to mediate the competition between updating and differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present a new analysis of experimental studies (Boeltzig, Liedtke, & Schubotz, 2025; Liedtke et al., 2025) that examine recognition memory and cued recall of similar conversations. The original version was recognized more confidently than the modified version, and the recognition confidence for modified versions showed a U-shaped dependence on the prediction error. Furthermore, the larger the prediction error, the more frequently participants retrieved two versions during cued recall. To account for these results, we propose a computational model based on a modified Hopfield network, which encodes the original and modified versions sequentially and weights the encoding of new patterns by the prediction error. The model shows that (1) similar new memories interfere with previous ones (updating) while dissimilar ones are stored separately (differentiation), (2) interference from similar representations leads to reduced memory accuracy and lower-confidence recognition, and (3) the encoding weight must be modulated by the prediction error to account for the experimental data. Our modeling results show that prediction-error-driven competition between updating and differentiation can emerge from intrinsic network dynamics alone.",

      "title": "Social Reward Learning Deficits and Concordant Brain Alterations in Rats Overexpressing Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1)",
      "content": "<p>Social deficits are a hallmark of schizophrenia, often characterized by impairments in processing and integrating socially transmitted information. However, translational models that accurately capture these deficits remain scarce. The Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 gene (<i>DISC1</i>), a key susceptibility factor implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, has been shown to cause DISC1 protein aggregation and dysfunctional signaling when modestly overexpressed, ultimately resulting in aberrant dopamine homeostasis. In this study, we employed a transgenic rat model overexpressing human <i>DISC1</i> (tgDISC1 rats) to investigate social reward learning and microstructural integrity in the brain. Using a modified Social Transmission of Food Preference (STFP) task, we report that male tgDISC1 rats failed to update reward preferences based on social information, despite intact nonsocial reward learning&mdash;suggesting a specific deficit in social reward learning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a behaviorally naive cohort revealed reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in key subcortical regions, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and substantia nigra, as well as areas mediating cortical-subcortical communication as the thalamus. Structural alterations in corresponding neuroanatomical areas have also been described in DTI of schizophrenia patients. Our findings link aberrant DISC1 signaling with impaired connectivity in parts of the mesolimbic system, critical for integrating social information into decision-making. This model recapitulates both behavioral and structural endophenotypes of schizophrenia and suggests that social impairments may stem from a fine-grained circuit-selective dysfunction rather than a generalized reward processing deficit. The tgDISC1 rat thus offers a translational platform for probing the neural substrates of social dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.</p>",

      "title": "Early heart disease prediction using LV-PSO and Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolution Neural Network on phonocardiogram signals",
      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "title": "Circuit-level modeling of prediction error computation of multi-dimensional features in voluntary actions",
      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",
