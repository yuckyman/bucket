      "title": "Cortical astrocytes control stress resilience",
      "content": "Background: Chronic stress exposure is a risk factor for several psychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression (MDD), with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) playing a key role in mediating this stress susceptibility. However, most individuals who are exposed to chronic stress are resilient and do not develop psychopathology. Recent evidence suggests that glial cells, especially astrocytes, play an important role in controlling stress-induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior, yet their role in contributing to stress resilience is not understood. Methods: Using fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and RNA-sequencing in male mice, we establish a role for PFC astrocytes in stress resilience. Results: We demonstrate that stress-induced increases in astrocytic calcium activity are both necessary and sufficient for resilience. Bioinformatic analysis reveals robust transcriptional responses in PFC astrocytes that differ between susceptible vs. resilient mice and are unique when compared to astrocytic transcriptional changes in other limbic regions. Comparison with human RNA-sequencing data indicates that molecular changes observed in PFC astrocytes from susceptible mice converge with gene expression changes observed in MDD patients. Conclusions: Together, these data support targeting astrocytes as a potential therapy for negative behavioral consequences following stress exposure and reveal potential molecular mechanisms within PFC astrocytes that could contribute to depressive-like behaviors.",

      "title": "Sequential coupling of sleep oscillations enables concept-neuron reactivation and supports information flow across the human hippocampal-cortical circuit",
      "content": "Effective memory consolidation during sleep is thought to rely on the transfer of reactivated memory traces from the hippocampus to the cortex. However, the mechanisms supporting this essential dialogue across brain areas remain poorly understood. Here, we recorded single-neuron activity (n = 1097) in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of 10 epilepsy patients across 21 nights of sleep. Before sleep, patients engaged in a memory task with stimuli eliciting concept-neuron responses. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, neuronal firing locked to sharp wave-ripples (SWR) revealed a directed flow of information from the hippocampus to cortical targets. Notably, within SWR-driven activity, experience-dependent concept neurons exhibited elevated co-activation both within and across MTL regions, indicating selective reactivation of behaviorally relevant information. Cross-regional co-activation of concept cells was markedly enhanced when hippocampal SWRs coincided with cortical slow oscillation-spindle complexes, suggesting an active role of the cortex in shaping interregional communication. These findings provide evidence that SWRs in humans selectively reactivate experience-related neural ensembles across the hippocampal-cortical network, while synergistic interactions with cortical slow oscillation-spindle events might facilitate effective memory consolidation.",

      "title": "Temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed actions",
      "content": "Tactile sensitivity is temporally modulated on a moving limb. Yet the functional significance of this modulation remains unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the temporal dynamics of early somatosensory processing in goal-directed reaching. Participants reached for their unseen left hand while brief vibrations were applied to the moving right index finger in different movement phases. Psychophysical results revealed tactile suppression during reaching, with sensitivity improving around maximum speed relative to the late movement phase. The EEG results were consistent with the psychophysical data. Specifically, the short-latency P45 component, originating in primary somatosensory cortex, was suppressed during reaching, but recovered around maximum speed. Reduced P45 amplitudes were associated with stronger tactile suppression measured behaviorally, linking early cortical activity to perceptual changes. This temporally specific modulation of tactile perception associated with early cortical processing suggests that the somatosensory system dynamically adapts its sensitivity to facilitate sensorimotor control in goal-directed actions.",

      "title": "Show HN: GibRAM an in-memory ephemeral GraphRAG runtime for retrieval",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN,<p>I have been working with regulation-heavy documents lately, and one thing kept bothering me. Flat RAG pipelines often fail to retrieve related articles together, even when they are clearly connected through references, definitions, or clauses.<p>After trying several RAG setups, I subjectively felt that GraphRAG was a better mental model for this kind of data. The Microsoft GraphRAG paper and reference implementation were helpful starting points. However, in practice, I found one recurring friction point: graph storage and vector indexing are usually handled by separate systems, which felt unnecessarily heavy for short-lived analysis tasks.<p>To explore this tradeoff, I built GibRAM (Graph in-buffer Retrieval and Associative Memory). It is an experimental, in-memory GraphRAG runtime where entities, relationships, text units, and embeddings live side by side in a single process.<p>GibRAM is intentionally ephemeral. It is designed for exploratory tasks like summarization or conversational querying over a bounded document set. Data lives in memory, scoped by session, and is automatically cleaned up via TTL. There are no durability guarantees, and recomputation is considered cheaper than persistence for the intended use cases.<p>This is not a database and not a production-ready system. It is a casual project, largely vibe-coded, meant to explore what GraphRAG looks like when memory is the primary constraint instead of storage. Technical debt exists, and many tradeoffs are explicit.<p>The project is open source, and I would really appreciate feedback, especially from people working on RAG, search infrastructure, or graph-based retrieval.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/gibram-io/gibram</a><p>Happy to answer questions or hear why this approach might be flawed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665393</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 1</p>",
