      "content": "arXiv:2509.10064v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Converting customer survey feedback data into usable insights has always been a great challenge for large software enterprises. Despite the improvements on this field, a major obstacle often remains when drawing the right conclusions out of the data and channeling them into the software development process. In this paper we present a practical end-to-end approach of how to extract useful information out of a data set and leverage the information to drive change. We describe how to choose the right metrics to measure, gather appropriate feedback from customer end-users, analyze the data by leveraging methods from inferential statistics, make the data transparent, and finally drive change with the results. Furthermore, we present an example of a UX prototype dashboard that can be used to communicate the analyses to stakeholders within the company.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.10043v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Authentication is the cornerstone of information security in our daily lives. However, disabled users such as Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) ones are left behind in digital services due to the lack of accessibility. According to the World Health Organization, 36 million people are blind worldwide. It is estimated that there will be 115 million by 2050, due to the ageing of the population. Yet accessing digital services has become increasingly essential. At the same time, cyber threats targeting individuals have also increased strongly in the last few years. The ALIAS project addresses the need for accessible digital authentication solutions for BLV users facing challenges with digital technology. Security systems can inhibit access for these individuals as they become more complex. This project aims to create a barrier-free authentication system based on cognitive ergonomics and user experience (UX) design methods specifically for BLV users. This paper presents an overview of current research in this area. We also identify research gaps, and finally, we present our project's methodology and approach. First, we will build a knowledge base on the digital practices and cognitive models of BLV users during authentication. This information will support the development of prototypes, which will be tested and refined through two iterations before finalizing the operational version.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.10015v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Online spaces involve diverse communities engaging in various forms of collaboration, which naturally give rise to discussions, some of which inevitably escalate into conflict or disputes. To address such situations, AI has primarily been used for moderation. While moderation systems are important because they help maintain order, common moderation strategies of removing or suppressing content and users rarely address the underlying disagreements or the substantive content of disputes. Mediation, by contrast, fosters understanding, reduces emotional tension, and facilitates consensus through guided negotiation. Mediation not only enhances the quality of collaborative decisions but also strengthens relationships among group members. For this reason, we argue for shifting focus toward AI-supported mediation. In this work, we propose an information-focused framework for AI-supported mediation designed for community-based collaboration. Within this framework, we hypothesize that AI must acquire and reason over three key types of information: content, culture, and people.",

This study examines how Reddit's r/maleinfertility community helps overcome these barriers through digital support networks. Using topic modeling (115 topics), network analysis (11 micro-communities), and time-lagged regression on 11,095 posts and 79,503 comments from 8,644 users, we found the community functions as a hybrid space: informal diagnostic hub, therapeutic commons, and governed institution. Medical advice dominates discourse (63.3\\%), while emotional support (7.4\\%) and moderation (29.2\\%) create essential infrastructure. Sustained engagement correlates with actionable guidance and affiliation language, not emotional processing. Network analysis revealed structurally cohesive but topically diverse clusters without echo chamber characteristics. Cross-posters (20\\% of users) who bridge r/maleinfertility and the gender-mixed r/infertility community serve as navigators and mentors, transferring knowledge between spaces. These findings inform trauma-informed design for stigmatized health communities, highlighting role-aware systems and navigation support.",

While deceptive design is well-studied in 2D platforms, little is known about its manifestation in VR environments and its impact on user privacy. This research investigates deceptive designs in privacy communication and interaction mechanisms of 12 top-rated VR games and applications through autoethnographic evaluation of the applications and thematic analysis of privacy policies. We found that while many deceptive designs rely on 2D interfaces, some VR-unique features, while not directly enabling deception, amplified data disclosure behaviors, and obscured actual data practices. Convoluted privacy policies and manipulative consent practices further hinder comprehension and increase privacy risks. We also observed privacy-preserving design strategies and protective considerations in VR privacy policies. We offer recommendations for ethical VR design that balance immersive experiences with strong privacy protections, guiding researchers, designers, and policymakers to improve privacy in VR environments.",

A recent study found no evidence of racial homophily in responses to mass shooting data visualizations. To increase the likelihood of detecting an effect, we redesigned the experiment by replacing bar charts with anthropographics and expanding the sample size. In a crowdsourced study (N=720), we showed participants a pictograph of mass shooting victims in the United States, with victims from one of three racial groups (Hispanic, Black, or White) highlighted. Each participant was assigned a visualization highlighting either their own racial group or a different racial group, allowing us to assess the influence of racial concordance on changes in affect (emotion). We found that, across all conditions, racial concordance had a modest but significant effect on changes in affect, with participants experiencing greater negative affect change when viewing visualizations highlighting their own race. This study provides initial evidence that racial homophily can emerge in responses to data visualizations, particularly when using anthropographics.",

As data sharing becomes more prevalent in science, enabling effective data reuse is increasingly important. In this paper, we present a power systems case study of data repurposing for enabling data reuse. We define data repurposing as the process of transforming data to fit a new research purpose. In our case study, we repurpose a geospatial wildfire smoke forecast dataset into a historical dataset. We analyze its efficacy toward analyzing wildfire smoke impact on solar photovoltaic energy production. We also provide documentation and interactive demos for using the repurposed dataset. We identify key enablers of data reuse including metadata standardization, contextual documentation, and communication between data creators and reusers. We also identify obstacles to data reuse such as risk of misinterpretation and barriers to efficient data access. Through an iterative approach to data repurposing, we demonstrate how leveraging and expanding knowledge transfer infrastructures like online documentation, interactive visualizations, and data streaming directly address these obstacles. The findings facilitate big data use from other domains for power systems applications and grid resiliency.",

This study investigates how personality expression levels and user-agent personality alignment influence perceptions in goal-oriented tasks. In a between-subjects experiment (N=150), participants completed travel planning with CAs exhibiting low, medium, or high expression across the Big Five traits, controlled via our novel Trait Modulation Keys framework. Results revealed an inverted-U relationship: medium expression produced the most positive evaluations across Intelligence, Enjoyment, Anthropomorphism, Intention to Adopt, Trust, and Likeability, significantly outperforming both extremes. Personality alignment further enhanced outcomes, with Extraversion and Emotional Stability emerging as the most influential traits. Cluster analysis identified three distinct compatibility profiles, with \"Well-Aligned\" users reporting substantially positive perceptions. These findings demonstrate that personality expression and strategic trait alignment constitute optimal design targets for CA personality, offering design implications as LLM-based CAs become increasingly prevalent.",

We explore integrating AI into document comments, a concept we formalize as AI margin notes. Three design parameters characterize this approach: margin notes are integrated with the text while chat interfaces are not; selecting text for a margin note can be automated through AI or manual; and the generation of a margin note can involve AI to various degrees. Two experiments investigate integration and selection automation, with results showing participants prefer integrated AI margin notes and manual selection. A third experiment explores human and AI involvement through six alternative techniques. Techniques with less AI involvement resulted in more psychological ownership, but faster and less effortful designs are generally preferred. Surprisingly, the degree of AI involvement had no measurable effect on reading comprehension. Our work shows that AI margin notes are desirable and contributes implications for their design.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.09815v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mixed Reality (MR) presents novel opportunities to investigate how individuals perceive themselves and others during shared, augmented experiences within a common physical environment. Previous research has demonstrated that users can embody avatars in MR, temporarily extending their sense of self. However, there has been limited exploration of body-swapping, a condition in which two individuals simultaneously inhabit each other's avatars, and its potential effects on social interaction in immersive environments. To address this gap, we adapted the Joint Simon Task (JST), a well-established implicit paradigm, to examine how body-swapping influences the cognitive and perceptual boundaries between self and other. Our results indicate that body-swapping led participants to experience themselves and their partner as functioning like a single, unified system, as in two bodies operating as one agent. This suggests possible cognitive and perceptual changes that go beyond simple collaboration. Our findings have significant implications for the design of MR systems intended to support collaboration, empathy, social learning, and therapeutic interventions through shared embodiment.",

Here, we introduce the first 3D, data-driven musculoskeletal model of Drosophila legs, implemented in both OpenSim and MuJoCo simulation environments. Our model incorporates a Hill-type muscle representation based on high-resolution X-ray scans from multiple fixed specimens. We present a pipeline for constructing muscle models using morphological imaging data and for optimizing unknown muscle parameters specific to the fly. We then combine our musculoskeletal models with detailed 3D pose estimation data from behaving flies to achieve muscle-actuated behavioral replay in OpenSim. Simulations of muscle activity across diverse walking and grooming behaviors predict coordinated muscle synergies that can be tested experimentally. Furthermore, by training imitation learning policies in MuJoCo, we test the effect of different passive joint properties on learning speed and find that damping and stiffness facilitate learning. Overall, our model enables the investigation of motor control in an experimentally tractable model organism, providing insights into how biomechanics contribute to generation of complex limb movements. Moreover, our model can be used to control embodied artificial agents to generate naturalistic and compliant locomotion in simulated environments.",

      "title": "Cognitive Effort in the Two-Step Task: An Active Inference Drift-Diffusion Model Approach",
      "content": "arXiv:2508.04435v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: High-level theories rooted in the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis often frame cognitive effort as the cost of resolving the conflict between habits and optimal policies. In parallel, evidence accumulator models (EAMs) provide a mechanistic account of how effort arises from competition between the subjective values of available options. Although EAMs have been combined with frameworks like Reinforcement Learning to bridge the gap between high-level theories and process-level mechanisms, relatively less attention has been paid to their implications for a unified notion of cognitive effort. Here, we combine Active Inference (AIF) with the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) to investigate whether the resulting AIF-DDM can simultaneously account for effort arising from both habit violation and value discriminability. To our knowledge, this is the first time AIF has been combined with an EAM. We tested the AIF-DDM on a behavioral dataset from the two-step task and compared its predictions to an information-theoretic definition of cognitive effort based on AIF. The model's predictions successfully accounted for second-stage reaction times but failed to capture the dynamics of the first stage. We argue the latter discrepancy likely stems from the experimental design rather than a fundamental flaw in the model's assumptions about cognitive effort. Accordingly, we propose several modifications of the two-step task to better measure and isolate cognitive effort. Finally, we found that integrating the DDM significantly improved parameter recovery, which could help future studies to obtain more reliable parameter estimates.",

      "title": "Overground gait transitions are not sharp but involve gradually changing walk-run mixtures even over long distances",
      "content": "arXiv:2501.00720v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Humans typically walk at low speeds and run at higher speeds. Previous studies of transitions between walking and running were mostly on treadmills, but real-world locomotion allows more flexibility. Here, we study overground locomotion over long distances (800 m or 2400 m) under time constraints, simulating everyday scenarios like going to an appointment. Unlike on treadmills, participants can vary both speed and gait during this task. We find that gait transition in this overground task occurs over a broad `gait transition regime' spanning average speeds from 1.9 m/s to 3.0 m/s. In this regime, people use mixtures of walking and running: mostly walking at low average speeds (around 1.9 m/s) and mostly running at high average speeds (3.0 m/s); the walk vs run fraction gradually changes between these speed limits. Within any walk-run mixture, there is a speed gap between the walking and running. These gait mixtures and their specific structure are predicted by energy optimality. These findings extend earlier results from much shorter distance tasks, showing that similar energetic principles govern longer, more physically and cognitively demanding tasks. Overall, our results highlight the role of whole-task energy minimization including transients in shaping human locomotion.",

In this work we illustrate how fundamental ideas of physics, such as energy and conserved quantities, can be explored for such models. We show that time-rescaling renders recent next-generation neural mass models Hamiltonian in the limit of a homogeneous population or strong coupling. The corresponding energy-like quantity provides considerable insight into the model dynamics even in the case of heterogeneity, and explain for example why orbits are near-ellipsoidal and predict spike amplitude during bursting dynamics. We illustrate how these energy considerations provide a possible link between neuronal population behavior and energy landscape theory, which has been used to analyze data from brain recordings. Our introduction of near-Hamiltonian descriptions of neuronal activity could permit the application of highly developed physics theory to get insight into brain behavior.",

      "title": "The nature of alpha modulation through neurofeedback",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.10046v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electroencephalographic neurofeedback (EEG-NF) has been proposed as a promising technique to modulate brain activity through real-time EEG-based feedback. Alpha neurofeedback in particular is believed to induce rapid self-regulation of brain rhythms, with applications in cognitive enhancement and clinical treatment. However, whether this modulation reflects specific volitional control or non-specific influences remains unresolved. In a preregistered, double-blind, sham-controlled study, we evaluated alpha upregulation in healthy participants receiving either genuine or sham EEG-NF during a single-session design. A third arm composed of a passive control group was also included to differentiate between non-specific influences related or not to the active engagement in EEG-NF. Throughout the session, alpha power increased robustly, yet independently of feedback veracity, engagement in self-regulation, or feedback update frequency. Parallel increases in theta and sensorimotor rhythms further suggest broadband non-specific modulation. Importantly, these results challenge the foundational assumption of EEG-NF: that feedback enables volitional EEG control. Instead, they point to spontaneous repetition-related processes as primary drivers, calling for a critical reassessment of neurofeedback efficacy and its underlying mechanisms.",

      "title": "Cerebellar Contributions to Action and Cognition: Prediction, Timescale, and Continuity",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.09818v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The cerebellum is implicated in nearly every domain of human cognition, yet our understanding of how this subcortical structure contributes to cognition remains elusive. Efforts on this front have tended to fall into one of two camps. On one side are those who seek to identify a universal cerebellar transform, a single algorithm that can be applied across domains as diverse as sensorimotor learning, social cognition, and decision making. On the other side are those who focus on functional specializations tailored for different task domains. In this perspective, we propose an integrated approach, one that recognizes functional specialization across different cerebellar subregions, but also builds on common constraints that help define the conditions that engage the cerebellum. Drawing on recurring principles from the cerebellum's well-established role in motor control, we identify three core constraints: Prediction - the cerebellum performs anticipatory, not reactive, computations; Timescale - the cerebellum generates predictions limited to short intervals; and Continuity - the cerebellum transforms continuous representations such as space and time. Together, these constraints define the boundary conditions underlying when and how the cerebellum supports cognition, and, just as importantly, specify the types of computations that should not depend on the cerebellum.",
