      "content": "CONCLUSION: In this population of infants with severe ROP, the introduction of dexamethasone eye drops was associated with a significant reduction in the proportion of infants requiring traditional ROP treatments. A timely administration of low-dose dexamethasone eye drops may serve as a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive intervention to reduce one of the leading causes of severe visual impairment worldwide. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",

These are largely asymptomatic and subtle findings that are often missed. They require an early consult to ophthalmology for appropriate management. The major limitations in this study are that it is a single-center, cross-sectional study design that has a low number of patients, lacks a healthy...",

However, non-destructive testing (NDT) technologies offer significant advantages in terms of speed, accuracy and non-invasiveness, enabling real-time monitoring of egg quality during production, transportation, storage and sale.2. A review was conducted to evaluate various NDT techniques, including optical methods (such as visible - near infrared...",
