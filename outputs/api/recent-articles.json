      "content": "arXiv:2509.04676v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04510v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.",

      "title": "Conversational AI increases political knowledge as effectively as self-directed internet search",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.05219v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational AI systems are increasingly being used in place of traditional search engines to help users complete information-seeking tasks. This has raised concerns in the political domain, where biased or hallucinated outputs could misinform voters or distort public opinion. However, in spite of these concerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political information-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users' political knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions: First, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we find that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users - and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political information relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of randomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues, models, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political knowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in misinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken together, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly turning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not lead to increased public belief in political misinformation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05166v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many transport authorities are collecting and publishing almost real-time road traffic data to meet the growing trend of massive open data, a vital resource for foresight decision support systems considering deep data insights. Using such a traffic count dataset, we explored the spatio-temporal transitions in the cross-country road traffic volumes in the context of modelling behavioural transitions in car-based human mobility. We developed a reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional variables of traffic flow. This study reports on individual car-based daily travel behaviour detected, before (2016-2018) and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021), between Germany and neighbouring countries (Luxembourg, France and Belgium). In relevance to the net-zero carbon transition, further study should shed light on the interpolation and downscaling approaches at the comprehensive road-network level for identifying pollution hot spots, causal link to functional landuse patterns and calculation of spatial influence area. In the case of Luxembourg, the Bridges and Roads Authority has installed a large digital traffic observatory infrastructure through the adoption of sensor-based IoT technologies, like other European member states. Since 2016, they have provided high-performance data processing and published open data on the country's road traffic. The dataset contains an hourly traffic count for different vehicle types, daily for representative observation points, followed by a major road network. The original dataset contains significant missing entries, so comprehensive data harmonization was performed.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05145v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.",

In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animating realistic avatars requires using high quality animations for every possible state the avatar can be in. This includes actions like walking or running, but also subtle movements that convey emotions and personality. Idle animations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for realism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often handcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording realistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know they are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons idle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper concludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real, and that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that handmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two conclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is thought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the movements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions should help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also publish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real and acted idle motions.",

SePA combines: (1) Individualized models predicting daily stress, soreness, and injury risk from wearable sensor data (28 users, 1260 data points); and (2) A retrieval module that grounds LLM-generated feedback in expert-vetted web content to ensure contextual relevance and reliability. Our predictive models, evaluated with rolling-origin cross-validation and group k-fold cross-validation show that personalized models outperform generalized baselines. In a pilot expert study (n=4), SePA's retrieval-based advice was preferred over a non-retrieval baseline, yielding meaningful practical effect (Cliff's $\\delta$=0.3, p=0.05). We also quantify latency performance trade-offs between response quality and speed, offering a transparent blueprint for next-generation, trustworthy personal health informatics systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04705v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04636v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.",

We first validated our approach in the written word domain, where the technique identified significant correlations for word frequency in the left mid-fusiform cortex (at the location of the Visual Word Form Area) with a left occipital region tracking bigram frequency, compatible with prior reports. During listening, low-frequency spoken words elicited greater responses in a left mid-superior temporal region consistent with the recently-described Auditory Word Form Area (AWFA), while a more posterior region of the superior temporal gyrus was sensitive to syllable frequency. Activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus correlated with both written and spoken word frequency. These findings demonstrate parallel hierarchical organizations in the anteroventral visual and auditory streams, with modality-specific lexica and upstream sublexical representations that converge in higher-order language areas.",

      "title": "Spatial layout of visual specialization is shaped by competing default mode and sensory networks",
      "content": "Understanding how the brain encodes information started with a map but turned into a maze: paths multiplied; boundaries blurred. Neurons tuned to specific features are not confined to single regions, but distributed across the cortex. Retinotopy, once thought limited to early visual areas, now appears in over 20 cortical regions, from the tip of the occipital cortex to the shore of the lateral frontal cortex. To describe and understand these complex mosaics of functional specialization, we focus on the spatial influences that shape their emergence across the cortical sheet. To this end, we developed Spatial Component Decomposition (SCD), a sparse dictionary learning framework that locates sources of spatial influence without relying on prior assumptions from systems neuroscience. Applied to MRI data capturing retinotopic maps, SCD reveals a dominant linear gradient extending over 60 mm from V1 and covering all the known posterior visual areas. Yet, it also revealed systematic competition from other primary sensory areas and default mode transmodal hubs. These suppressive influences shape the cortical embedding of visual information, even during purely visual tasks. Our results suggest that functional specialization emerges from spatial competition between representational systems, not just from feedforward inputs.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in all age groups. The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",

      "content": "Robotic racket sports provide exceptional benchmarks for evaluating dynamic motion control capabilities in robots. Due to the highly non-linear dynamics of the shuttlecock, the stringent demands on robots' dynamic responses, and the convergence difficulties caused by sparse rewards in reinforcement learning, badminton strikes remain a formidable challenge for robot systems. To address these issues, this study proposes DTG-IRRL, a novel learning framework for badminton strikes that integrates imitation-relaxation reinforcement learning with dynamic trajectory generation. The framework demonstrates significantly improved training efficiency and performance, achieving faster convergence and twice the landing accuracy. Analysis of the reward function within a specific parameter space hyperplane intuitively reveals the convergence difficulties arising from the inherent sparsity of rewards in racket sports and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in mitigating local and slow convergence. Implemented on hardware with zero-shot transfer, the framework achieves a 90% hitting rate and a 70% landing accuracy, enabling sustained humanrobot rallies. Cross-platform validation using the UR5 robot demonstrates the framework's generalizability while highlighting the requirement for high dynamic performance of robotic arms in racket sports.",

      "content": "Upper limb amputation significantly affects daily functioning and quality of life. Although myoelectric prostheses offer a promising avenue for restoring motor capabilities, high rates of device abandonment underscore challenges in control performance and user integration. Recent advances in high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown potential to enhance prosthetic dexterity. HD-EMG interfaces capture richer spatial and temporal muscle activation data, while ML algorithms exploit this information to improve intention detection and motion control. This mini-review explores advancements in HD-EMG acquisition systems, including both interface designs and recording technologies, as well as ML algorithms leveraging spatial information. In addition to summarizing the current state of the art, we discuss the challenges and the opportunities of embedding these technologies in prosthetic systems, with the objective of facilitating the translation of laboratory research into clinical applications.",

      "content": "BackgroundThe neural mechanisms underlying somatosensory processing in individuals with acquired single-sided deafness (SSD) and potential central neuronal cross-modal reorganization remain largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of SSD on somatosensory perception and attentional processing.MethodsElectrophysiological responses using EEG, and behavioral measures (discrimination thresholds, hit rates and reaction times) were assessed in adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls for vibrotactile stimulation at two distinct frequencies. Differences in cortical somatosensory evoked potentials between adults with acquired SSD and normal-hearing (NH) controls, focusing on peak amplitudes and peak times of key event-related potential components (P50, N70, P100, N140, and P3b) and their cortical generators were assessed.ResultsWhile both groups exhibited comparable behavioral performance, significant differences emerged in electrophysiological responses. Individuals with SSD showed increased P3b amplitude (albeit non-significant) and significantly delayed P3b peak times, indicating that individuals with acquired SSD exhibit alterations in attentional mechanisms associated with somatosensory perception. In addition, source localization analysis of the P50 component using standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) revealed group differences in cortical activation patterns, with SSD individual showing additional recruitment of auditory-related areas, including the superior temporal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus and the insula. This further supports the notion of compensatory neuroplasticity in auditory pathways following severe to profound unilateral hearing loss.ConclusionOur results indicate that SSD is associated with neural reorganization in somatosensory and auditory pathways. The observed modifications in both early and late somatosensory responses, coupled with alterations in source activity, suggest that individuals with SSD engage alternative neural mechanisms when processing vibrotactile stimuli, differing from the typical patterns observed in NH individuals. Understanding these changes prior to cochlear implantation will facilitate the development of personalized auditory rehabilitation strategies following cochlear implantation.",
