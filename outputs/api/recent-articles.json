      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "Revisiting the explicit-implicit additivity assumption in visuomotor adaptation",
      "content": "Explicit aiming strategies have been shown to play an important role in visuomotor adaptation, enabling rapid improvements in performance and affording flexibility, but their interaction and downstream consequences on implicit recalibration processes remain hotly debated. While early work assumed these processes combined additively, recent studies have challenged this view. However, these studies may have overlooked subtle spatial and temporal dynamics, which could influence how explicit aiming and implicit recalibration interact. Recent research shows that implicit recalibration anchors to where a person aims their movements, with aiming strategies directly shaping their spatial development. Moreover, implicit recalibration operates across multiple timescales, with both temporally volatile and persistent components. To examine whether these factors mask the true relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration, we conducted a visuomotor rotation task while carefully accounting for the interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics. After controlling for spatial dynamics (plan-based generalization) and temporal dynamics (forgetting), we found a strong relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration. Despite finding this strong relationship, it appears to be sub-additive, which may result from simple methodological imprecision, the operation of additional but unobserved processes, or more complex nonlinear interactions between processes.",

      "content": "Risk-taking is often thought to depend on homeostatic systems. However, evidence remains mixed, and the underlying mechanisms remain debated. One candidate that might drive changes in risky decision-making due to changes in homeostatic systems may be the hunger hormone ghrelin, which interacts with the dopaminergic system. In two studies, we examined the effects of experimental interventions known to affect ghrelin levels on human risky choice in healthy male participants, either after a brief fasting period (study 1, N=37; N=26 for fMRI analyses) or a single night of total sleep deprivation (study 2, N=40; N=36 for fMRI analyses). We found no credible effects of the experimental manipulations on the proportion of risky choices. In addition, computational modelling indicated that the standard prospect theory, without accounting for choice repetition, best described the observed behaviour. However, it did not reveal consistent effects of state manipulations on model parameters, and the inclusion of manipulation-induced changes in ghrelin levels in the model likewise revealed no robust associations. FMRI analyses did not reveal effects of state manipulation on neural signatures of subjective value or choice in a priori defined regions of interest (bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex for subjective value; bilateral anterior insula, ventral striatum, and right medial prefrontal cortex for choice). Our results suggest that state-dependent influences on risky decision-making may be weaker than previously thought.",

      "content": "<p>Clink lets you use the coding agents you already pay for (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Z.ai GLM) to build \u2192 live-preview \u2192 ship apps in an isolated container.<p>No token purchases, no extra cost for coding. Just link your existing Claude/OpenAI/Gemini account and start building and deploying instantly.<p>Why we built this:<p>Claude Code is our go-to for coding, but it lacked preview + deploy capabilities. We didn't want to pay Lovable again just for that.<p>Different agents excel at different tasks - Claude Code for versatility, Codex for complex work, GLM for speed. We needed one platform to leverage them all.<p>CLI agents offer more freedom than traditional web builders. We wanted to unlock their full potential with proper dev tooling.<p>What it does:<p>\u2022 Prompt \u2192 Build \u2192 Live \u2192 Deploy - The fastest path from idea to live website. Deploy for free.<p>\u2022 BYO Subscription - Use your existing plans efficiently (Claude Code $20 = 10x Lovable $25 usage, GLM $3 = 3x Claude Code $20)<p>DEV Mode (Beta):<p>\u2022 Multi-stack support - Build with Node, Python, Go, Rust and deploy containers to public URLs instantly<p>\u2022 Repo imports - Upgrade and deploy your existing projects across any stack<p>Links:<p>\u2022 Clink: <a href=\"https://clink.new\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://clink.new</a><p>\u2022 OSS origin (Claudable, ~2.8k): <a href=\"https://github.com/opactorai/Claudable\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/opactorai/Claudable</a><p>We'd love any feedback, bug reports, or stack requests - we iterate fast and read every comment.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45657055\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45657055</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 7</p>",
