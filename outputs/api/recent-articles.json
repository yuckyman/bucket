      "title": "Neonatal morphine and HIV synergy induce persistent neuroimmune and anxiety-related transcriptional states",
      "content": "Background: Early life opioid exposure can disrupt neurodevelopment and heighten vulnerability to anxiety and affective disorders, particularly in individuals with HIV. Methods: Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we profiled adolescent brains from wild-type and HIV1 transgenic (Tg26) mice exposed to morphine during postnatal days 2 to 7. Results: Morphine exposure in Tg26 mice resulted in a highly dysregulated microglial phenotype, characterized by the ectopic upregulation of genes encoding neuronpeptides (Avp, Hcrt, and Pmch), while simultaneously showing a reduction in both inflammatory and homeostatic markers (Map3k6, Lgals3, Ccl3). Microglia also showed enhanced expression of dynorphin (Pdyn) and {kappa}-opioid receptor (Oprk1) signaling modules implicated in dysphoria and stress-induced negative effects. Furthermore, transcriptomic mapping revealed cell-type-specific neuronal adaptations: cholinergic neurons upregulated genes linked to anxiety and arousal (Avp, Oxt), GABAergic neurons upregulated genes linked to condition and aversive behavior, whereas glutamatergic neurons enriched for transcripts associated with thigmotaxis and fear behaviors. Conclusions: Together, these findings demonstrate that brief neonatal morphine exposure in an HIV-inflamed milieu induces persistent, cell-type-specific neuroimmune and neurotransmitter reprogramming that engages the dynorphin KOR pathway and predisposes to anxiety- and aversion-related behaviors.",

      "title": "Dual-targeting snRNA gene therapy rescues STMN2 and UNC13A splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the selective deterioration of motor neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). A key driver of this pathogenesis is nuclear loss of ALS-associated protein TDP-43, leading to mis-splicing of TDP-43 targets including important neuronal genes STMN2 and UNC13A. Here, we have developed a gene therapy strategy for ALS and related TDP-43 proteinopathies, to correct mis-splicing of both STMN2 and UNC13A cryptic exons using small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) encoded from a single vector. We identified promoter sequence elements to increase therapeutic snRNA expression by 10-fold, then further optimized the expression cassette with combinatorial snRNA targeting to rescue multiple cryptic splicing targets. The engineered snRNAs restored normal pre-mRNA processing of both STMN2 and UNC13A transcripts despite TDP-43 loss of function, rescuing stathmin-2 protein levels in iPSC derived motor neurons, restoring their axonal regeneration capacity to wild-type levels. In addition, adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of the snRNAs to the murine central nervous system in the constitutive cryptic splicing model Stmn2Hum{Delta}GU fully restored cortical Stmn2 pre-mRNA processing, highlighting the utility of snRNAs as a therapeutic modality in vivo. Together, this study demonstrates that snRNAs are a promising and versatile therapeutic strategy for the simultaneous correction of multiple aberrant transcripts affected by cryptic splicing in TDP-43 proteinopathies.",

      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",
