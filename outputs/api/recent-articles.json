      "title": "Common characteristics of variants linked to autism spectrum disorder in the WAVE regulatory complex",
      "content": "Six variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) abnormally activate the WASP-family Verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC), a critical regulator of actin dynamics. This abnormal activation may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we recently investigated the structural dynamics of wild-type (WT) WRC and R87C, A455P, and Q725R WRC disease-linked variants. Here, by extending MD simulations to I664M, E665K, and D724H WRC, we suggest that all of the mutations weaken the interactions and affect intra-complex allosteric communication between the WAVE1 active C-terminal region (ACR) and the rest of the complex. This might contribute to an abnormal complex activation, a hallmark of WRC-linked ASD. In addition, all mutants but I664M destabilize the ACR V-helix and increase the participation of ACR in large-scale movements. All these features may also abnormally influence the inactive WRC toward a dysfunctional state. We hypothesize that small-molecule ligands counteracting these effects may help restore normal WRC regulation in ASD-related variants.",

      "content": "The first six months of life mark a critical window for human brain development, characterized by rapid synaptic formation, axonal growth, and network reorganization. During this period' large-scale functional networks progressively mature. Although prior infant fMRI studies have characterized temporal functional connectivity, the spatial organization and refinement of brain networks during early infancy remain underexplored. In this study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state fMRI from 74 typically developing infants (0-6 months; 137 scans) using group independent component analysis (ICA) with group-information-guided ICA (GIG-ICA) back-reconstruction. Spatial dissimilarity between each infants spatial map and the group-level map was quantified using cosine dissimilarity and Euclidean distance. Generalized additive models were applied to model age-related trends. Both cosine and Euclidean dissimilarity metrics showed significant decreases with age, indicating a progressive convergence of individual network topographies toward the group-level architecture. These findings reveal increasing spatial coherence and refinement of large-scale brain networks during early infancy, suggesting that spatial maturation complements the well-established functional integration observed in temporal connectivity studies.",

      "title": "Altered striatal dopamine dynamics and behavior in Grin2a mutant mice, a genetic mouse model of schizophrenia",
      "content": "Schizophrenia (SCZ), a complex psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis, is thought to involve, at least in part, dopamine dysregulation in the striatum. Recent large-scale exome sequencing has identified multiple SCZ risk genes, including GRIN2A (encoding an NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor subunit) and AKAP11 (encoding a protein kinase A binding protein), which is also a risk gene for bipolar disorder (BD). However, the mechanisms by which these genetic risk factors perturb dopamine circuits and cause psychotic symptoms remain poorly understood. We asked how behavior, dorsomedial striatal dopamine (DA) dynamics and the activity of D1-/D2-spiny projection neurons (SPNs) were altered in Grin2a and Akap11 mutants. In the open field, Grin2a knockout mice display hyperlocomotion and an abnormal organization of naturalistic behaviors. They also displayed heightened behavioral responses to objects and auditory stimuli. Grin2a heterozygous animals mostly showed intermediate phenotypes, suggesting a dose-dependent effect of Grin2a loss. Further, Grin2a knockout mutants exhibited aberrant dopamine events, altered coupling of dopamine with locomotor features, and exaggerated stimuli-evoked dopamine responses. Notably, heterozygous animals also showed altered striatal SPN events in the open field reflecting dysregulated neural activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs. Compared to Grin2a mutants, Akap11 mutants displayed opposite phenotypes, showing reduced locomotion with a shift from high- to low-velocity movement and distinct alterations in striatal neural activity. Together, GRIN2A (SCZ risk) and AKAP11 (BD/SCZ risk) mutations induce different, often opposite, effects on striatal dopamine signaling and behavior, suggesting that these two risk genes act through distinct mechanisms.",

      "title": "Mapping the Developmental Trajectory of Functional Brain Networks in Early Infancy: Insights into Typical Maturation",
      "content": "Early infancy is a crucial period for brain development, during which fundamental functional and structural frameworks are established. Understanding the maturation of large-scale brain networks during this stage is essential for characterizing normative neurodevelopment and identifying potential deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we investigated developmental changes in the spatial organization of functional brain networks in infants using a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset comprising 137 scans from 74 low-likelihood developing infants aged 0-6 months. We applied independent component analysis to extract large-scale brain networks and utilized advanced spatial metrics, including network-averaged spatial similarity (NASS) to assess alignment with group-level patterns, network strength to quantify neural engagement based on voxel intensities, and network size to examine spatial distribution. Our findings reveal significant age-related increases in NASS across multiple networks, indicating greater consistency in functional organization over time. Additionally, most networks demonstrated increased network strength, reflecting heightened neural involvement, while network size exhibited distinct developmental trajectories, with some networks expanding and others remaining stable. These results highlight the dynamic evolution of functional brain architecture during early infancy, providing critical insights into neurodevelopmental processes.",

      "title": "Memory traces bias new learning for hippocampal generalization",
      "content": "The ability to use generalized prior experience to guide behavior in novel situations is a fundamental cognitive function. While recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus supports generalization how this is accomplished is poorly understood. Here we combined longitudinal optical imaging in head-fixed mice with computational modeling to examine generalization in hippocampal area CA1. We found that prior training accelerated behavioral adaptation to a novel environment and that this was accompanied by highly stable hippocampal representations. We identified putative memory traces from prior experience that enabled this generalization at multiple levels. At the population level, novel-context network dynamics rapidly aligned with low-dimensional neural subspaces established during prior experience. At the cellular level, spatially-informative weak ''residual'' activity reflecting generalizable information about the task structure appeared to bias which neurons form place fields (PFs) and where via behavioral timescale synaptic plasticity (BTSP). Finally, this was an active process as many PFs changed their reference frame in the novel environment to reflect the consistent task structure. In sum, the influence of memory traces on new PF formation may allow past experience to guide new learning such that representations are based on generalizable features, thus enabling rapid adaptive behavior in new contexts.",

      "title": "Synthesizing images to map neural networks to the human brain",
      "content": "Computational models can be used to generate hypotheses about the brain. In the visual system, this approach has revealed similarities between how natural images are represented in convolutional neural networks and in cortical regions. However, natural images generate highly correlated representations across the hierarchy of model layers, meaning that each brain region will not correspond selectively to a single layer. Because each model layer performs additional image transformations, gaining a more selective mapping between individual layers and regions could reveal how specific algorithmic stages of processing are instantiated in the brain. To enable this mapping, we developed a generative framework for image synthesis that minimizes the similarity of image representational similarity matrices across model layers, aiming to orthogonalize the distances between the patterns of unit activations evoked by the same set of images. With the patterns orthogonalized, the resulting similarity matrix for each layer provides a fingerprint of the unique computational role of that layer. To test this approach, we synthesized 16 artificial images from the Inception-V1/GoogLeNet model and scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed these images repeatedly in random order. Image-specific patterns of voxel activity were used to compute image-by-image similarity matrices across the whole brain with searchlights. Most layers could be mapped to circumscribed cortical regions, and these mappings overlapped less than the mappings obtained with natural images. Given the prevalence of existing fMRI datasets with natural images, we used the synthesis method as a benchmark to develop an alternative residual method that can achieve comparable performance for natural image datasets. These approaches could be extended to other neural network architectures and stimulus modalities for targeted mappings of model computations to the brain and behavior.",

      "content": "Early life stress (ELS) is a strong risk factor for several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and is associated with persistent molecular alterations in corticolimbic regions, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we combined unbiased proteomics profiling and viral-mediated gene transfer to characterize the enduring epigenetic changes in the PFC of male and female mice previously exposed to ELS. We found that ELS induced sex-specific and age-dependent accumulation of monomethylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 (H3K27me1), with a transient increase in adolescent females, and a delayed but enduring effect in adult males. ELS-induced H3K27me1 accumulation in the PFC involved changes of SUZ12, a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which controls H3K27 methylation patterns. Indeed, expression of the catalytic domain of SUZ12, VEFS, in PFC neurons during adolescence led to sex differences in social and cognitive alterations in adulthood. Together, our results demonstrate that H3K27me1 functions as a chromatin scar in the PFC, mediating lifelong susceptibility to ELS in a sex-specific manner.",

      "title": "Dysregulated lactate metabolism synergizes with ALS genetic risk factors to accelerate motor decline",
      "content": "Neurons rely on glial lactate shuttling for metabolic support, which declines with aging and in neurodegenerative disease. Full disruption of lactate shuttling in peripheral nerves causes progressive axon degeneration, but we were interested to understand how partial disruption, a scenario more relevant to aging and disease, contributes to neurodegeneration risk. Pyruvate and lactate are interconverted by lactate dehydrogenases (LDHA and LDHB) in both lactate producing and consuming cells. We therefore began by investigating Ldhb knockout mice (loss of LDHA, the dominant LDH in liver and muscle, caused embryonic lethality), and discovered that they develop progressive neuromuscular junction atrophy and functional decline without axon degeneration. Because even Ldhb+/- heterozygosity significantly affects motor behavior, we also wondered about a potential link to congenital disease and pursued this by identifying rare loss-of-function LDHB variants among ALS patients. Next, to better understand how LDHB loss leads to motor decline, we selectively deleted it in defined cell types. SC-specific deletion caused robust motor defects, whereas motor neuron-specific deletion has little effect. Reasoning that neuronal LDHB deficiency could model age-associated decline in lactate metabolism, we asked whether it would interact with ALS genetic risk. Indeed, motor-neuron LDHB deficiency synergizes with relatively mild ALS risk variants, TDP43-Q331K and Sod1-D83G knock-in alleles, to produce early motor neuropathy, indicating that LDHB loss enhances disease risk. These findings establish lactate metabolism as a modifier of motor system vulnerability and highlight it as a therapeutic target in peripheral as well as central neurodegeneration.",

      "content": "Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often emerge in adolescence. Identifying their symptom structures and neural biomarkers in youth with elevated risk is critical for early detection and developing interventions. This study investigated the central symptoms of MDD and GAD and identified the key brain regions (brain bridges) linking structural neuroanatomy to symptoms in at-risk adolescents. Methods: A total of 1,568 adolescents at high risk for MDD and 413 adolescents at high risk for GAD were identified from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Participants completed MDD and GAD symptom assessments and underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanning. We constructed 10 psychological network models incorporating symptoms and brain structural indices to identify central symptoms and brain bridges. Results: Concentration difficulties emerged as the shared core symptom, while self-hatred and irritability were the unique central symptoms for MDD and GAD, respectively. Left- and right-pallidum volumes exhibited the highest bridge centrality for MDD symptoms, whereas left-nucleus accumbens volume showed the highest bridge centrality for GAD symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the pallidum and nucleus accumbens as key brain regions linking structural anatomy to symptom networks in high-risk youth. These results provide novel insights into early neurobiological markers of MDD and GAD from a symptom-oriented perspective and may inform targeted interventions.",

Recent research highlights impaired cerebral lymphatic drainage in PD, suggesting a potential therapeutic target.Case presentationWe report a 56-year-old male with advanced PD who underwent deep cervical lymphovenous bypass (DCLB) surgery, a novel intervention designed to enhance lymphatic drainage by anastomosing the deep cervical lymphatic vessel to a vein. The patient had been diagnosed with PD in 2024 after experiencing progressive motor symptoms since 2019, with suboptimal response to conventional pharmacotherapy.ResultsAt three-month follow-up, significant improvements were observed: Movement Disorder Society\u2013Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale decreased by 30.4% (from 23 to 16), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale decreased by 71.4% (from 77 to 22), and Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire-39 decreased by 94.2% (from 52 to 3). Both motor symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia) and non-motor symptoms (sleep disturbances, orthostatic dizziness) showed improvement.ConclusionDCLB was technically feasible and was followed by symptomatic improvements in this single patient. The underlying mechanism for this clinical response remains unclear and was not investigated with biomarkers in this report. While these preliminary findings are hypothesis-generating, causality cannot be inferred from an individual case. Further controlled studies incorporating neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers are needed to explore potential mechanisms.",

      "title": "A multimodal MRI framework employing machine learning for detecting beginning cognitive impairment in Parkinson\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Cognitive deficits affect up to half of the patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) within a decade of diagnosis, placing an increasing burden on patients, families and caregivers. Therefore, the development of strategies for their early detection is critical to enable timely intervention and management. This study aimed to classify cognitive performance in patients with PD using a binary support vector machine (SVM) model that integrates structural (high-resolution anatomical) and functional connectivity (FC; resting state) MRI data with clinical characteristics. We hypothesized that PD patients with beginning cognitive deficits can be detected through MRI in combination with machine learning. Data from 38 PD patients underwent extensive preprocessing, including large-scale FC and voxel-based analysis. Relevant features were selected using a bootstrapping approach and subsequently trained in an SVM model, with robustness ensured by 10-fold cross-validation. Although clinical parameters were considered during feature selection, the final best-performing model exclusively comprised imaging features\u2014including gray matter volume (e.g., anterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus) and inter-network functional connectivity within the frontoparietal, default mode, and visual networks. This combined model achieved an accuracy of 94.7% and a ROC-AUC of 0.98. However, a model integrating clinical and only functional MRI data reached similar results with an accuracy of 94.7% and a ROC-AUC of 0.90. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that applying machine learning to multimodal MRI data\u2014integrating structural, functional, and clinical metrics\u2014could advance the early detection of cognitive impairment in PD and could therefore be used to support timely diagnosis.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello!</p> <p>I'm not the biggest fan of making GUIs and I make a lot of little projects that need some level of interaction. I tend to recreate a similar basic CLI each time which, after doing it 5+ times, felt like I was wasting time. Unfortunately projects are usually different enough that I couldn't just reuse the same menu's so I decided to try to make something that would dynamically generate the boiler-plate (I think that's how you use that term here) for me and I can just hook my programs into it and get a basic prototype going!</p> <p>To preface, I have only been coding for about a year now but I LOVE backend work (especially in regards to data) and have had a lot of fun with Python and Java. That being said, I'm still learning so there could be easier ways to implement things. I will gladly accept any and all feedback!</p> <h1>Target Audience:</h1> <p>Honestly, anyone! I started out making this just for me but decided to try to make it a lot more dynamic and formal to not only practice but just in-case someone else felt it could be useful. If you want an easy to use CLI for your project, you can generate your project, delete the generator, and go on with your day! I provided as much documentation on how everything works and should work including a walkthrough example! If you're like me and you always make small projects that need a CLI, then keep the generator and just customize it using its templates.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Most alternatives I found are libraries that help <em>build</em> CLIs (things like <code>argparse</code>, <code>Click</code>, or <code>Typer</code> ). They\u2019re great, but they don\u2019t handle the scaffolding, folder layout, documentation, or menu structure for you.</p> <p>I also wanted something that acted like a personal \u201ctoolbox,\u201d where I could easily include my own reusable helpers or plugin packs across projects.</p> <p>So instead of being a CLI framework, this is a <strong>project generator</strong>: it creates the directory structure, menu classes, navigation logic, optional modules, and usage guide for you, based on the structure you define. Out of the tools I looked at, this was the only one focused on generating the entire project skeleton, not just providing a library for writing commands. This generator doesn't need you to write any code for the menus nor for template additions. You can make your project as normal and just hook it into the noted spots (I tried to mark them with comments, print statements, and naming conventions).</p> <h1>What My Project Does:</h1> <p>This tool simply asks for:</p> <p>- A project name<br /> - Navigation style (currently lets you pick between numbers or arrows)<br /> - Formatting style (just for the title of each menu there is minimal, clean, or boxed)<br /> - Optional features to include (either the ones I include or that someone adds in themselves, the generator auto-detects it)<br /> - Menu structure (you get guided through the name of the menu, any sub-menus, the command names and if they are single or batch commands, etc.)</p> <p>At the end, it generates a complete ready-to-use CLI project with:</p> <p>- Menu classes<br /> - UI helpers<br /> - General utilities<br /> - Optional selected plugins (feature packs?)<br /> - Documentation (A usage guide)<br /> - Stubs for each command and how to hook into it (also print statements so you know things are working until then)</p> <p>All within a fairly nice folder structure. I tried really hard to make it not need any external dependencies besides what Python comes with. It is template driven so future additions or personal customizations are easy to drag and drop into either Core templates (added to every generated CLI) or Optional ones (selectable feature).</p> <p>You can find the project here: <a href=\"https://github.com/Urason-Anorsu/CLI-Toolbox-Generator\">https://github.com/Urason-Anorsu/CLI-Toolbox-Generator</a></p> <p>Also here are some images from the process, specifically the result:<br /> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/eyzbM1X\">https://imgur.com/a/eyzbM1X</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Urasonlol\"> /u/Urasonlol </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p6xu9g/i_made_a_python_cli_project_generator_to_avoid/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p6xu9g/i_made_a_python_cli_project_generator_to_avoid/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Simplex polynomial in complex networks and its applications to compute the Euler characteristic",
      "content": "In algebraic topology, a k-dimensional simplex is defined as a convex polytope consisting of k + 1 vertices. If spatial dimensionality is not considered, it corresponds to the complete graph with k + 1 vertices in graph theory. The alternating sum of the number of simplices across dimensions yields a topological invariant known as the Euler characteristic, which has gained significant attention due to its widespread application in fields such as topology, homology theory, complex systems, and biology. The most common method for calculating the Euler characteristic is through simplicial decomposition and the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 formula. In this study, we introduce a new \u201csubgraph\u201d polynomial, termed the simplex polynomial, and explore some of its properties. Using those properties, we provide a new method for computing the Euler characteristic and prove the existence of the Euler characteristic as an arbitrary integer by constructing the corresponding simplicial complex structure. When the Euler characteristic is 1, we determined a class of corresponding simplicial complex structures. Moreover, for three common network structures, we present the recurrence relations for their simplex polynomials and their corresponding Euler characteristics. Finally, at the end of this study, three basic questions are raised for the interested readers to study deeply.",

      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "content": "Background and objectiveMost individuals with schizophrenia reside in the community, where they frequently encounter difficulties related to emotional problems and social functioning\u2013 critical areas of concern in the rehabilitation process. This study aims to investigate the effects of a comprehensive group music therapy intervention on the emotional state and social functioning of individuals with schizophrenia undergoing community rehabilitation.MethodsA total of 28 individuals with schizophrenia in community rehabilitation were randomly assigned to either the music intervention group (n = 14) or the control group (n = 14). The music intervention group participated in an 8-week comprehensive group music therapy intervention, while the control group continued with routine family life. The music therapy program was culturally adapted to the local community context, incorporating familiar regional music and dialect. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) served as the primary outcome to assess affective changes, and the Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) served as the secondary outcome to evaluate social functioning. Both measures were administered pre- and post-intervention. In addition, some participants in the intervention group completed semi-structured interviews to explore changes in social functioning and affect.ResultsFollowing the intervention, the music therapy group showed significant improvements in positive affect, social activities and self-care, as measured by the PANAS and SDSS, respectively. In contrast, no significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group. Semi-structured interviews further supported these findings, with participants in the intervention group reporting enhanced emotional state and improved social functioning.ConclusionComprehensive group music therapy appears to be an effective intervention for improving emotional states and social functioning in individuals with schizophrenia engaged in community rehabilitation. This culturally adapted intervention model demonstrates its potential for broader application.",

      "content": "IntroductionMyotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy, affects not only motor function and muscle integrity but also leads to debilitating cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and multisystem complications. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is increasingly recognized, manifesting as impairments in working memory, executive function, sleep regulation, and mood and behavior. These interrelated, multisystemic features contribute to multifaceted symptoms that significantly reduce quality of life for patients and their families. To identify potential biomarkers of CNS disease activity in DM1, we performed the first exploratory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiling study.MethodsCSF samples from patients with DM1 (n\u202f= 11) and healthy controls (n\u202f= 5) were analyzed using Olink monoclonal antibody panels, quantifying 1,072 proteins. LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression identified proteins discriminating between DM1 and controls. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Reactome database to assess biological significance.ResultsSix candidate biomarker proteins were differentially expressed between between DM1 patients and controls: CKAP4, SCARF1, NCAM1, CD59, PTH1R, and CA4. LASSO analysis further identified 15 proteins discriminating DM1 and controls, implicating pathways related to neuronal health, neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, motor control, neuromuscular junction integrity, and cytoskeletal regulation. Dysregulated pathways included IGF transport, MAPK signaling, NCAM signaling, and broader signal transduction cascades pathways also implicated in other neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuromuscular disorders.DiscussionThis first exploratory CSF proteomic analysis in DM1 identified dysregulated protein networks that may underlie CNS dysfunction in this multisystemic disease. These findings provide novel insights into DM1 pathophysiology and support the potential of CSF proteomic signatures as candidate diagnostic tools, indicators of disease activity, and measures of therapeutic response, pending validation in larger, independent cohorts.",

      "content": "IntroductionBlast-induced ocular trauma is a major cause of vision loss in both civilian and military populations and effective treatments are limited by the adult mammalian retina\u2019s inability to regenerate neurons lost to injury or aging. This study evaluated the neurogenic potential of PNU-282987, an alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, in an adult mouse model of blast-induced retinal trauma. We tested whether a delayed treatment paradigm, initiated after substantial neuronal loss occurred, could induce neurogenesis and restore retinal function.MethodsAdult mice received a single blast exposure, resulting in a significant reduction in cell counts across all retinal layers and decreased electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes. One month after injury, when neuronal loss was fully established, daily eye drops of PNU- 282987 were administered for two weeks. Neurogenesis and cellular proliferation were assessed using BrdU incorporation and co-labeling with retinal ganglion cell and photoreceptor markers. Retinal function was evaluated with ERG recordings, and cell counts in treated retinas were compared with untreated blasted eyes and uninjured controls.ResultsDelayed PNU-282987 treatment induced robust cellular proliferation and neurogenesis throughout the retina. Treated retinas showed significantly increased retinal ganglion cell and photoreceptor counts compared with untreated blast-injured eyes, reaching levels not significantly different from control retinas. Electrophysiological analysis revealed a significant recovery of ERG amplitudes, returning to baseline levels in most cases.Discussion/ConclusionThese findings demonstrate that PNU-282987-induced neurogenesis is sufficient to restore retinal structure and function even when treatment is initiated one month after blast injury. This work establishes a promising novel therapeutic approach for treating retinal trauma in adults.",
