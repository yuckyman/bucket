      "title": "Ptf1a robustly drives the gliogenic switch in the rodent embryonic cortex in a dosage-dependent manner by activating pro-glial gene expression programs",
      "content": "It is widely believed that the gliogenic switch during rodent embryonic development is governed by the orchestrated crosstalk between a cohort of genes and extracellular cues. Here we report that ectopic expression of the single bHLH factor, pancreas transcription factor 1 (PTF1A), is sufficient to drive radial glial progenitors (RGPs)-regardless of progenitor heterogeneity and developmental stage-to differentiate into glial cells. Ptf1a-expressing RGPs exhibit progenitor behaviors indicative of a neurogenic-to-gliogenic fate transition, resembling endogenous progenitors at the late stages of embryonic development, and preferentially produce OLIG2+ oligodendrocytes in vivo, some of which are positive for PDGFR or CC1. This robust gliogenic competency depends on the dosage of stable Ptf1a expression in RGPs. RNAseq reveals 'the glial transcriptome', including upregulated expression of several notch signaling components and the endothelin receptors in Ptf1a RGPs. We further identify Ednrb as one of the downstream targets of Ptf1a that directs RGPs toward gliogenesis via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In summary, our study uncovers a novel and robust role for Ptf1a in glial fate specification, offering a potential strategy for generating human oligodendrocytes in vitro.",

      "title": "Parallel circadian-like oscillations in LTP and excitation inhibition balance in mouse CA1 reverse direction after puberty",
      "content": "Long-term potentiation (LTP), the best characterized form of Hebbian synaptic plasticity, is well known to be under strong circadian regulation. In mice and rats, both nocturnal species, most studies indicate that LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region is more robust when induced during the dark phase. Our examination of the underlying mechanisms at the CA3 to CA1 synapse provides evidence that the capacity to express LTP does not differ between the light and dark cycles of the 24hour day. Instead, the magnitude of theta-burst stimulation induced LTP (TBSLTP) correlates with daily fluctuations in the ratio of synaptic excitation to inhibition (E/I ratio): both the E/I ratio and TBSLTP are higher during the dark phase. Consistent with a causal relationship, blockade of inhibition abolishes the light dark difference in TBS LTP induction, likewise, pairing induced LTP, which is less constrained by inhibitory recruitment, does not differ between cycles. Supporting this model, using the APP/PS1 model of AD we observed that neither the E/I ratio nor TBSLTP change during the light cycle. Finally, we made the intriguing observation that these daily oscillations reverse direction after puberty in WT mice, shifting from being larger in the dark cycle of 2month old mice to being larger in the light cycle in 8month old mice. This developmental switch may reflect an age-dependent reorganization of circadian control over hippocampal plasticity.",

      "title": "Auditory Stimulus Information Entropy Modulates Inter-Brain Synchronization: Evidence from Wireless EEG Hyperscanning",
      "content": "Inter-brain synchronization (IBS) -- reflecting inter-individual correlated neural activity during interaction -- marks shared experiences like music listening. The ability of complex auditory stimuli (e.g., music) to induce IBS links to their information dynamics, notably the uncertainty they evoke, which challenges the nervous system's predictive coding. Based on mutual prediction theory (interacting individuals simultaneously process their own behavior and predict their partner's; accurate mutual predictions lead to convergent neural representations and thus IBS), this study hypothesized that higher stimulus uncertainty enhances IBS (heightened uncertainty reduces independent predictability, promoting convergent representations and stronger IBS). Using information entropy to quantify uncertainty, the study conducted hyperscanning, manipulated entropy across Resting State and 6 Hz auditory stimuli (ASSR, MMN, AHER, Dream Wedding), and measured IBS via phase-locking values (PLV). Results showed frequency specificity: 6 Hz PLV increased with entropy (DW {approx} AHER > MMN {approx} ASSR > Resting State); Alpha band had highest PLV in Resting State. Critically, PLVs differed significantly between any two conditions, and each experimental condition's PLV was also significantly different from that of the Resting State. Findings confirm a 6 Hz-specific positive association between auditory uncertainty and IBS, suggesting musical elements may facilitate social interaction by modulating entropy, with entropy-IBS relations showing frequency dependence.",

      "title": "AAV-mediated overexpression of Prdm12 in knee-innervating afferents reduces inflammatory joint pain and neuronal hyperexcitability in mice",
      "content": "Inflammatory joint pain features in numerous musculoskeletal disorders that affect millions globally. The Prdm12 gene encodes a conserved zinc finger transcriptional regulator expressed selectively in the nervous system. In humans, PRDM12 mutations can cause congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP) or midface toddler excoriation syndrome (MiTES). Prdm12 is prominently expressed in developing somatosensory ganglia, where it plays a crucial role in nociceptive neuron development, its expression being maintained in mature C-LTMRs (C-low threshold mechanoreceptors) and nociceptive neurons. Despite enhanced understanding of Prdm12's role in neuronal excitability and pain behavior, the impact of Prdm12 overexpression in mature nociceptive neurons has not been explored. Here, we conducted intravenous injection of AAV-PHP.S viral vectors encoding Prdm12-GFP (Prdm12-AAV) or GFP alone (Control-AAV), observing no overt changes in mouse behavior. When examining the properties of Prdm12 overexpressing sensory neurons in vitro, we observed an increase in rheobase alongside decreased neuronal responses to capsaicin and ATP, indicating a downregulation of TRPV1 and P2X ion channels activity, respectively. We next conducted intraarticular administration of viral constructs in female mice to determine how Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating sensory neurons alters their excitability and influences inflammatory joint pain induced by intraarticular administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Prdm12 overexpression in knee-innervating neurons decreased inflammation-induced changes in digging and weight bearing, prevented inflammation-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, and decreased macroscopic voltage-gated ion channel conductance. Our findings illustrate that Prdm12 overexpression strongly modulates neuronal excitability in adult animals, highlighting its importance in pain perception and its potential as an analgesic target.",

      "title": "The impact of the serotonergic psychedelic DOI on active vision in freely moving mice",
      "content": "Psychedelic compounds have the ability to generate altered states of consciousness and profoundly distort perception, often resulting in visual hallucinations. While psychedelics have recently regained attention for their potential cognitive and therapeutic effects, how these drugs affect visual processing to generate visual distortions and hallucinations is not as well characterized. Furthermore, studies investigating the effect of psychedelics on visual function have all been done using head-fixed preparations, preventing animals from engaging in the natural visual behaviors that the visual system evolved to support. To determine the impact of psychedelics on active vision, we recorded neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of mice during free movement, while simultaneously recording eye and head position, before and after administration of the serotonergic psychedelic DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine). We find that DOI increases the frequency of visual active sensing behaviors during free movement and leads to a net reduction in the visually-evoked activity that these behaviors generate in V1. The effect of DOI was highly diverse across the population of V1 neurons, driving suppression and facilitation of visual responses in a laminar specific manner. Finally, the effects of DOI were dependent upon both visual input and the statistics of the stimulus. We found a striking dissociation between impact on gaze shift responses and flashed sparse noise presented during head-fixation, which may reflect predictability of the stimulus. These findings provide insights into how psychedelics disrupt sensory processing and the neural mechanisms underlying these altered perceptual states.",

      "title": "Adolescent Alcohol Exposure Disrupts Astrocyte-Synaptic Structural And Functional Coupling In The Male Dorsal Hippocampus",
      "content": "Adolescence is a window of heightened vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of binge ethanol exposure. Adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure has been shown to induce long lasting cognitive and behavioral impairments in patients and rodent models that increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). Our previous work shows that these behavioral deficits coincide with persistent dysfunction of astrocytes. Here, we aim to understand how astrocyte synaptic structural and functional crosstalk are disrupted following AIE to provide better mechanistic understanding of why behavioral impairments persist into adulthood. Male Sprague Dawley rats received AIE, a variety of adeno-associated viruses encoding astrocyte specific sensors, and fiber implantation in the dorsal hippocampal (dHipp) for in vivo photometry. A subset of rats received hM3D(Gq) to chemogenetically activate astrocytes. Following AIE and a forced abstinence period that allowed growth into adulthood, rats underwent assessment in the contextual fear conditioning (CFC) task with simultaneous fiber photometry recordings. By combining immunohistochemistry (IHC), Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy, fiber photometry, chemogenetics, and slice physiology, we show that AIE induces structural and functional decoupling of astrocytes from synapses and astrocyte dysregulation that persists into adulthood. Remarkably, stimulating astrocytic calcium signaling via chemogenetic activation attenuates heightened fear responding and restores gliotransmitter availability. These findings highlight a critical role for astrocyte synaptic crosstalk in regulating fear learning and underscore the untapped therapeutic potential of targeting astrocytes to improve behavioral outcomes following substance use.",

      "title": "ARHGEF17 Deficiency Induces Endothelial Dysfunction and Intracranial Aneurysm Formation via RhoA/ROCK2/MLC Signaling Pathway",
      "content": "BACKGROUND: Genetic susceptibility critically contributes to intracranial aneurysm (IA) formation and rupture, but the mechanisms linking genetic variants to vascular dysfunction remain unclear. ARHGEF17, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulating RhoA activation and cytoskeletal dynamics, has been identified as a potential IA risk gene. METHODS: CRISPR-Cas9-generated ARHGEF17-/- mice and morpholino-based ARHGEF17-deficient zebrafish were used to assess in vivo vascular effects. An elastase/DOCA-induced IA model evaluated aneurysm formation, rupture, and survival. Vascular remodeling of the Circle of Willis was analyzed by histology and immunofluorescence. Endothelial function was examined in HUVECs with lentiviral ARHGEF17 knockdown. Activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling was assessed by G-LISA and Western blotting, with Y-27632 used to test ROCK2 dependence. RESULTS: ARHGEF17 deficiency increased IA incidence and rupture, accompanied by elastic fiber fragmentation, VSMC dedifferentiation, and inflammatory activation. Zebrafish lacking ARHGEF17 exhibited intracranial hemorrhage and vascular instability. In endothelial cells, ARHGEF17 silencing impaired proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and barrier integrity while activating the RhoA/ROCK2/MLC pathway. ROCK inhibition with Y-27632 restored endothelial function and cytoskeletal organization. CONCLUSIONS: ARHGEF17 maintains cerebrovascular integrity by regulating RhoA/ROCK2/MLC-mediated cytoskeletal dynamics. Its deficiency drives endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, and IA formation, while ROCK inhibition reverses these effects, identifying the RhoA/ROCK2 axis as a therapeutic target for ARHGEF17 mutation-associated IAs.",

      "title": "Effects of color-enhancing filters on color salience in normal trichromats",
      "content": "Notch filters can alter color contrasts by selectively filtering different spectral bands of the stimulus and have been developed to enhance reddish-greenish contrasts for color-deficient observers with anomalous trichromacy. We examined the effects of such filters on color salience for normal trichromats, using a visual search paradigm where the task was to locate a color target superimposed on a variegated chromatic background, similar to foraging for fruits among foliage. Background colors varied along a bluish-yellowish or purplish to yellow-green (short-wave cone isolating) axis, roughly spanning the range of dominant color variations in arid or lush environments. Target colors sampled a wide range of hue angles and contrasts. Testing was conducted on a computer monitor, with the filter effects simulated by calculating corresponding chromaticities with or without the filter for naturalistic (Munsell) reflectances. The filter evaluated (Enchroma SuperX glasses) was designed to increase color contrast along a magenta-green axis. Consistent with this, search times for targets on the blue-yellow background were significantly faster for the filter condition, because the filter increased the target-background color difference. Alternatively, overall differences in search times were not observed for the S-cone background. The differences on the two backgrounds could be qualitatively accounted for by the relative salience of the stimuli predicted by a perceptual color space (CIELAB). Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the filters for enhancing visual performance for normal trichromats and naturalistic tasks, and illustrate how these effects depend on the potential color characteristics of the environment.",

      "title": "Artificial microRNAs targeting Tau enable post-symptomatic functional recovery in aged tauopathy mice",
      "content": "Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and progressive supranuclear palsy, characterized by the pathological accumulation of tau protein. While tau reduction has emerged as a promising disease-modifying strategy, most preclinical studies have focused on preventive approaches, and the therapeutic potential after clinical onset remains largely unexplored. This limitation is critical, as patients are typically diagnosed after symptoms emerge. Furthermore, global tau suppression may disrupt physiological tau functions and lead to adverse effects, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. RNA-based therapies, particularly microRNA (miRNA)-mediated silencing, offer high specificity, versatility, and sustained target knockdown. Here, we developed artificial microRNAs (Tau-miRNAs) designed for site-directed expression to selectively reduce tau levels in vulnerable brain regions, thereby minimizing off-target effects. We tested the efficacy of Tau-miRNAs in a tauopathy mouse model at advanced disease stages, delivering them into the prefrontal cortex after cognitive and electrophysiological deficits had developed. This post-symptomatic intervention led to long-term improvements in memory, restoration of neuronal firing properties, and reduced pathological tau at synapses. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of spatially targeted RNA-based tau-lowering strategies for late-stage intervention in tauopathies, addressing a critical unmet need in the treatment of these devastating disorders.",

      "title": "Heterogeneity of ictal firing during generalized seizures in the awake cortex",
      "content": "Cortico-thalamo-cortical oscillations are central to both normal and pathological brain activities and emerge from complex cortical and thalamic interactions. However, the specific activity of identified cortical neurons during the paroxysmal oscillations associated with absence seizures (ASs) in awake animals remains underexplored. The dominant narrative suggests that seizures indiscriminately disrupt cortical activity through generalized hyperexcitability, but direct evidence supporting this view is lacking. Here, we recorded single units from pyramidal neurons and different interneuron subtypes in the neocortex of two validated rodent models of absence epilepsy under awake, behaving conditions. We find that neurons maintain their firing rank order across interictal and ictal states, regardless of whether their ictal firing rate increases, decreases, or remains stable compared to the interictal phase. Rather than a random cortical takeover, ictal activity represents a scalable modulation of pre-existing network states. These results challenge the generalized hyperexcitability model and highlight the structured, heterogeneous nature of cortical activity during ASs, with implications for mechanistic understanding and targeted therapies.",

      "title": "Distinct cortical profiles underlie the common reportability of thought-free experiences",
      "content": "Mind blanking (MB) is a mental state of seemingly no reportable thought content. The question of how we can entertain no thoughts while awake is challenging for the study of spontaneous thinking. By combining EEG-fMRI with experience sampling during task performance, we categorised changes in mental content and self-reported vigilance to map the neurophysiological signatures of MB. We demonstrate that fMRI connectivity around MB reports is characterised by a \"rich\" pattern of long and short-range signal anticorrelations. At the same time, sleepiness reports are linked to a \"simpler\" hyperconnected fMRI pattern, characterised by overall positive connectivity. Put together, an interaction appears: when people report being alert, connectomes around MB reports resemble the hyperconnected pattern, indicating that the neuronal correlates of MB depend on self-rated vigilance. The hyperconnected pattern also correlated with EEG slow wave activity, tying MB's topology to sleep-like electrophysiology during wakefulness. Collectively, we show that distinct cortical events underlie the shared phenomenology of a thought-free mind. We conclude that MB's neurophysiological correlates vary across perceived vigilance levels and that more refined characterisation of the neuronal correlates of thought-less mental states exist. Our findings build on the quest to bridge mental content and its absence with measurable brain activity and provide insights into how ongoing thinking is maintained during wakefulness.",

      "content": "Determining if repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) proteins contribute to the CAG polyGln-encoding spinocerebellar ataxias (CAG-SCAs) is critical for understanding mechanisms and developing therapies for these diseases. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against polySer and polyLeu repeats and locus specific C-terminal regions show sense polySer (AGC frame) and antisense polyLeu (CUG frame) RAN proteins accumulate in affected grey and white-matter brain regions, throughout the cerebellum and pons, in SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, and SCA7 autopsy brains. Cerebellar white matter regions with prominent polySer and polyLeu but minimal polyGln aggregates show demyelination, white matter loss, and activated microglia. In SCA3 mice, RAN proteins accumulate in an age-dependent manner. In neural cells, polySer and polyLeu RAN proteins are toxic and cause autophagic dysfunction. In cells, the FDA-approved drug metformin decreases RAN protein levels and reduces toxicity. Taken together, these data identify sense and antisense RAN proteins as a common molecular mechanism shared by the CAG-SCAs.",

Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.
