      "title": "Soppia: A Structured Prompting Framework for the Proportional Assessment of Non-Pecuniary Damages in Personal Injury Cases",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21082v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Applying complex legal rules characterized by multiple, heterogeneously weighted criteria presents a fundamental challenge in judicial decision-making, often hindering the consistent realization of legislative intent. This challenge is particularly evident in the quantification of non-pecuniary damages in personal injury cases. This paper introduces Soppia, a structured prompting framework designed to assist legal professionals in navigating this complexity. By leveraging advanced AI, the system ensures a comprehensive and balanced analysis of all stipulated criteria, fulfilling the legislator's intent that compensation be determined through a holistic assessment of each case. Using the twelve criteria for non-pecuniary damages established in the Brazilian CLT (Art. 223-G) as a case study, we demonstrate how Soppia (System for Ordered Proportional and Pondered Intelligent Assessment) operationalizes nuanced legal commands into a practical, replicable, and transparent methodology. The framework enhances consistency and predictability while providing a versatile and explainable tool adaptable across multi-criteria legal contexts, bridging normative interpretation and computational reasoning toward auditable legal AI.",

      "title": "Digital Permission Structures: How Celebrity Disclosure Enables Black Masculine Vulnerability in Online Mental Health Discourse",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.20881v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Black men face a double barrier to mental health help-seeking: traditional masculinity norms demanding emotional restrictiveness and systemic racism fostering institutional mistrust. While celebrity mental health disclosures show promise for stigma reduction, limited research examines their impact on Black masculine communities through digital platforms. This convergent mixed-methods study analysed 11,306 YouTube comments following rapper Lil Wayne's unprecedented disclosure of childhood suicide attempt and lifelong mental health struggles. Quantitative analysis using VADER sentiment classification, Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modelling, and NRC emotion lexicon analysis revealed predominantly positive sentiment with systematic community amplification of mental health discourse. Reflexive thematic analysis of 2,100 high-engagement comments identified eight themes, with peer support achieving the highest saturation, contradicting isolation narratives. Findings support a Digital Permission Structures Model demonstrating how intersectional celebrity status (race + gender + high-status), hip-hop authenticity values, and digital platform affordances create triadic authorisation mechanisms enabling vulnerability expression. Community responses revealed communal masculinity rooted in Ubuntu philosophy and active reconstruction of masculine norms, positioning help-seeking as strength. Results challenge deficit-based models of Black masculinity, suggesting interventions should leverage collectivism, partner with high-status cultural figures, employ strength-based messaging, and centre hip-hop authenticity rather than imposing Western individualistic frameworks. This study provides evidence-based strategies for culturally responsive mental health interventions addressing persistent disparities in Black men's service utilisation.",

A robust measurement instrument is essential to correctly evaluate trust from a human-centered perspective. This paper describes the development and validation process of a trust measure instrument, which follows psychometric principles, and consists of a 16-items trust scale. The instrument was built explicitly for research in human-AI interaction to measure trust attitudes towards AI systems from layperson (non-expert) perspective. The use-case we used to develop the scale was in the context of AI medical support systems (specifically cancer/health prediction). The scale development (Measurement Item Development) and validation (Measurement Item Evaluation) involved six research stages: item development, item evaluation, survey administration, test of dimensionality, test of reliability, and test of validity. The results of the six-stages evaluation show that the proposed trust measurement instrument is empirically reliable and valid for systematically measuring and comparing non-experts' trust in AI Medical Support Systems.",

      "title": "Actionable Cybersecurity Notifications for Smart Homes: A User Study on the Role of Length and Complexity",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.21508v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The proliferation of smart home devices has increased convenience but also introduced cybersecurity risks for everyday users, as many devices lack robust security features. Intrusion Detection Systems are a prominent approach to detecting cybersecurity threats. However, their alerts often use technical terms and require users to interpret them correctly, which is challenging for a typical smart home user. Large Language Models can bridge this gap by translating IDS alerts into actionable security notifications. However, it has not yet been clear what an actionable cybersecurity notification should look like. In this paper, we conduct an experimental online user study with 130 participants to examine how the length and complexity of LLM-generated notifications affect user likability, understandability, and motivation to act. Our results show that intermediate-complexity notifications are the most effective across all user groups, regardless of their technological proficiency. Across the board, users rated beginner-level messages as more effective when they were longer, while expert-level messages were rated marginally more effective when they were shorter. These findings provide insights for designing security notifications that are both actionable and broadly accessible to smart home users.",

Rooted in research through design and participatory design methodologies, the civic tool integrates a data dashboard, stakeholder committee, and structured co-design sessions to facilitate collaborative analysis and intervention planning. The civic tool was developed in partnership with municipal authorities, law enforcement, NGOs, and social services, and reflects their institutional priorities while centering community knowledge. We describe the iterative co-design process, including stakeholder workshops for design, validation, training, and evaluation. The civic tool's impact on stakeholder trust, collaboration, and decision-making was assessed through surveys and open-ended questionnaires. Our findings show that stakeholders valued the inclusive design approach and data-driven collaboration while revealing barriers in communication, data literacy, and operational coordination. Furthermore, political and institutional support was identified as critical to the civic tool's success. This paper contributes to research on community technologies by demonstrating how civic tools can be collaboratively developed to navigate wicked social problems through participatory design.",

Often implemented using general-purpose models, these systems are likely to give away the answers, which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints, adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41 participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek to develop learner-centered educational technologies.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.21011v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Generative AI tools are increasingly used to create portrayals of people in occupations, raising concerns about how race and gender are represented. We conducted a large-scale audit of over 1.5 million occupational personas across 41 U.S. occupations, generated by four large language models with different AI safety commitments and countries of origin (U.S., China, France). Compared with Bureau of Labor Statistics data, we find two recurring patterns: systematic shifts, where some groups are consistently under- or overrepresented, and stereotype exaggeration, where existing demographic skews are amplified. On average, White (--31pp) and Black (--9pp) workers are underrepresented, while Hispanic (+17pp) and Asian (+12pp) workers are overrepresented. These distortions can be extreme: for example, across all four models, Housekeepers are portrayed as nearly 100\\% Hispanic, while Black workers are erased from many occupations. For HCI, these findings show provider choice materially changes who is visible, motivating model-specific audits and accountable design practices.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.20958v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a 10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.21142v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A fine-grained account of functional selectivity in the cortex is essential for understanding how visual information is processed and represented in the brain. Classical studies using designed experiments have identified multiple category-selective regions; however, these approaches rely on preconceived hypotheses about categories. Subsequent data-driven discovery methods have sought to address this limitation but are often limited by simple, typically linear encoding models. We propose an in silico approach for data-driven discovery of novel category-selectivity hypotheses based on an encoder-decoder transformer model. The architecture incorporates a brain-region to image-feature cross-attention mechanism, enabling nonlinear mappings between high-dimensional deep network features and semantic patterns encoded in the brain activity. We further introduce a method to characterize the selectivity of individual parcels by leveraging diffusion-based image generative models and large-scale datasets to synthesize and select images that maximally activate each parcel. Our approach reveals regions with complex, compositional selectivity involving diverse semantic concepts, which we validate in silico both within and across subjects. Using a brain encoder as a \"digital twin\" offers a powerful, data-driven framework for generating and testing hypotheses about visual selectivity in the human brain - hypotheses that can guide future fMRI experiments.

However, standard implementations rely on discretizing spike times into binned count data, limiting temporal resolution and scalability. Here, we develop Monte Carlo (MC) methods and polynomial approximations (PA) to the continuous-time analog of these models, and show them to be advantageous over their discrete-time counterparts. Further, we propose using a set of exponentially scaled Laguerre polynomials as an orthogonal temporal basis, which improves filter identification and yields closed-form integral solutions under the polynomial approximation. Applied to both synthetic and real spike-time data from rodent hippocampus, our methods demonstrate superior accuracy and scalability compared to traditional binned GLMs, enabling functional connectivity inference in large-scale neural recordings that are temporally precise on the order of synaptic dynamical timescales and in agreement with known anatomical properties of hippocampal subregions. We provide open-source implementations of both MC and PA estimators, optimized for GPU acceleration, to facilitate adoption in the neuroscience community.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.20859v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In cognitive science and AI, a longstanding question is whether machines learn representations that align with those of the human mind. While current models show promise, it remains an open question whether this alignment is superficial or reflects a deeper correspondence in the underlying dimensions of representation. Here we introduce a methodology to probe the internal geometry of vision-language models (VLMs) by having them generate pairwise similarity judgments for a complex set of natural objects. Using multidimensional scaling, we recover low-dimensional psychological spaces and find that their axes show a strong correspondence with the principal axes of human perceptual space. Critically, when this AI-derived representational geometry is used as the input to a classic exemplar model of categorization, it predicts human classification behavior more accurately than a space constructed from human judgments themselves. This suggests that VLMs can capture an idealized or `denoised' form of human perceptual structure. Our work provides a scalable method to overcome a measurement bottleneck in cognitive science and demonstrates that foundation models can learn a representational geometry that is functionally relevant for modeling key aspects of human cognition, such as categorization.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.20855v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Brain decoding is a key neuroscience field that reconstructs the visual stimuli from brain activity with fMRI, which helps illuminate how the brain represents the world. fMRI-to-image reconstruction has achieved impressive progress by leveraging diffusion models. However, brain signals infused with prior knowledge and associations exhibit a significant information asymmetry when compared to raw visual features, still posing challenges for decoding fMRI representations under the supervision of images. Consequently, the reconstructed images often lack fine-grained visual fidelity, such as missing attributes and distorted spatial relationships. To tackle this challenge, we propose BrainCognizer, a novel brain decoding model inspired by human visual cognition, which explores multi-level semantics and correlations without fine-tuning of generative models. Specifically, BrainCognizer introduces two modules: the Cognitive Integration Module which incorporates prior human knowledge to extract hierarchical region semantics; and the Cognitive Correlation Module which captures contextual semantic relationships across regions. Incorporating these two modules enhances intra-region semantic consistency and maintains inter-region contextual associations, thereby facilitating fine-grained brain decoding. Moreover, we quantitatively interpret our components from a neuroscience perspective and analyze the associations between different visual patterns and brain functions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that BrainCognizer outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple evaluation metrics.",

      "title": "Multi-stable oscillations in cortical networks with two classes of inhibition",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.20848v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the classic view of cortical rhythms, the interaction between excitatory pyramidal neurons (E) and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons (I) has been shown to be sufficient to generate gamma and beta band rhythms. However, it is now clear that there are multiple inhibitory interneuron subtypes and that they play important roles in the generation of these rhythms. In this paper we develop a spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances of multiple rhythms within the network. Using tools from nonlinear dynamics, we explore the roles of each of the two classes of inhibition as well as the role of the VIP modulation on the properties of these rhythms.",

      "title": "Integrated representational signatures strengthen specificity in brains and models",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.20847v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The extent to which different neural or artificial neural networks (models) rely on equivalent representations to support similar tasks remains a central question in neuroscience and machine learning. Prior work has typically compared systems using a single representational similarity metric, yet each captures only one facet of representational structure. To address this, we leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics-each capturing a distinct facet of representational correspondence, such as geometry, unit-level tuning, or linear decodability-and assess brain region or model separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics that preserve geometric or tuning structure (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield stronger region-based discrimination, whereas more flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings suggest that geometry and tuning encode brain-region- or model-family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information tends to be more globally shared across regions or models. To integrate these complementary representational facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a framework originally developed for multi-omics data integration. SNF produces substantially sharper regional and model family-level separation than any single metric and yields robust composite similarity profiles. Moreover, clustering cortical regions using SNF-derived similarity scores reveals a clearer hierarchical organization that aligns closely with established anatomical and functional hierarchies of the visual cortex-surpassing the correspondence achieved by individual metrics.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.20846v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches.",

      "title": "Consciousness, natural and artificial: an evolutionary advantage for reasoning on reactive substrates",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.20839v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Precisely defining consciousness and identifying the mechanisms that effect it is a long-standing question, particularly relevant with advances in artificial intelligence. The scientific community is divided between physicalism and natural dualism. Physicalism posits consciousness is a physical process that can be modeled computationally; natural dualism rejects this hypothesis. Finding a computational model has proven elusive, particularly because of conflation of consciousness with other cognitive capabilities exhibited by humans, such as intelligence and physiological sensations. Here we show such a computational model that precisely models consciousness, natural or artificial, identifying the structural and functional mechanisms that effect it, confirming the physicalism hypothesis. We found such a model is obtainable when including the underlying (biological or digital) substrate and accounting for reactive behavior in substrate sub-systems (e.g., autonomous physiological responses). Results show that, unlike all other computational processes, consciousness is not independent of its substrate and possessing it is an evolutionary advantage for intelligent entities. Our result shows there is no impediment to the realization of fully artificial consciousness but, surprisingly, that it is also possible to realize artificial intelligence of arbitrary level without consciousness whatsoever, and that there is no advantage in imbuing artificial systems with consciousness.",
