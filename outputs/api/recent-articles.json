      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
      "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

      "title": "Measuring mild cognitive impairment whole-brain electroencephalography phase-amplitude coupling connectivity using polar mutual information",
      "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "Launch HN: Mentat (YC S16) \u2013 Controlling LLMs with Runtime Intervention",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN, I\u2019m Cyril from CTGT. Today we\u2019re launching Mentat (<a href=\"https://api.ctgt.ai/v1/chat/completions\">https://api.ctgt.ai/v1/chat/completions</a>), an API that gives developers deterministic control over LLM behavior, steering reasoning and removing bias on the fly, without the compute of fine-tuning or the brittleness of prompt engineering. We use feature-level intervention and graph-based verification to fix hallucinations and enforce policies.<p>This resonates in highly regulated industries or otherwise risky applications of AI where the fallout from incorrect or underperforming output can be significant. In financial services, using GenAI to scan for noncompliant communications can be arduous without an easy way to embed complex policies into the model. Similarly, a media outlet might want to scale AI-generated summaries of their content, but reliability and accuracy is paramount. These are both applications where Fortune 500 companies have utilized our technology to improve subpar performance from existing models, and we want to bring this capability to more people.<p>Here\u2019s a quick 2-minute demo video showing the process: <a href=\"https://video.ctgt.ai/video/ctgt-ai-compliance-playground-cfnl\">https://video.ctgt.ai/video/ctgt-ai-compliance-playground-cf...</a><p>Standard \"guardrails\" like RAG and system prompts are fundamentally probabilistic: you are essentially asking the model nicely to behave. This often fails in two ways. First, RAG solves knowledge <i>availability</i> but not <i>integration</i>. In our benchmarks, a model given context that \"Lerwick is 228 miles SE of T\u00f3rshavn\" failed to answer \"What is 228 miles NW of Lerwick?\" because it couldn't perform the spatial inversion.<p>Second, prompt engineering is brittle because it fights against the model's pre-training priors. For example, on the TruthfulQA benchmark, base models fail ~80% of the time because they mimic common misconceptions found on the internet (e.g. \"chameleons change color for camouflage\"). We found that we could literally turn up the feature for \"skeptical reasoning\" to make the model ignore the popular myth and output the scientific fact. This matters because for high-stakes use cases (like Finance or Pharma), \"mostly safe\" isn't acceptable\u2014companies need audit-grade reliability.<p>Our work stems from the CS dungeon at UCSD, with years spent researching efficient and interpretable AI, trying to \"open the black box\" of neural networks. We realized that the industry was trying to patch model behavior from the outside (prompts/filters) when the problem was on the inside (feature activations). We knew this was important when we saw enterprises struggling to deploy basic models despite having unlimited compute, simply because they couldn't guarantee the output wouldn't violate compliance rules. I ended up leaving my research at Stanford to focus on this.<p>Our breakthrough came while researching the DeepSeek-R1 model. We identified the \"censorship\" feature vector in its latent space. Amplifying it guaranteed refusal; subtracting it instantly unlocked answers to sensitive questions. This proved the model <i>had</i> the knowledge but was suppressing it. We realized we could apply this same logic to hallucinations, suppressing \"confabulation\" features to reveal the grounded truth. While some hallucinations stem from the inherent randomness of generative models, many can be identified with the concerted activation of a feature or group of features.<p>Instead of filtering outputs, we intervene at the activation level during the forward pass. We identify latent feature vectors (v) associated with specific behaviors (bias, misconception) and mathematically modify the hidden state (h):<p><pre><code>  h_prime = h - alpha * (h @ v) * v\n</code></pre>\nThis arithmetic operation lets us \"edit\" behavior deterministically with negligible overhead (<10ms on R1). For factual claims, we combine this with a graph verification pipeline (which works on closed weight models). We check semantic entropy (is the model babbling?) and cross-reference claims against a dynamic knowledge graph to catch subtle relational hallucinations that vector search misses.<p>On GPT-OSS-120b, this approach improved TruthfulQA accuracy from 21% to 70% by suppressing misconception features. We also improved the performance of this model to frontier levels on HaluEval-QA, where we reached 96.5% accuracy, solving the spatial reasoning failures where the baseline failed. It also handles noisy inputs, inferring \"David Icke\" from the typo \"David Of me\" where base models gave up. Full benchmarks at <a href=\"https://ctgt.ai/benchmarks\">https://ctgt.ai/benchmarks</a>.<p>Most startups in this space are observability tools that tell you only after the model failed. Or they are RAG pipelines that stuff context into the window. Mentat is an infrastructure layer that modifies the model's processing during inference. We fix the reasoning, not just the context. For example, that\u2019s how our system was able to enforce that if A is SE of B, then B is NW of A.<p>We believe that our policy engine is a superior control mechanism to RAG or prompting. If you\u2019re frustrated with current guardrails, we\u2019d love it if you would stress-test our API!<p>API: Our endpoint is drop-in compatible with OpenAI\u2019s /v1/chat/completions: <a href=\"https://docs.ctgt.ai/api-reference/endpoint/chat-completions\">https://docs.ctgt.ai/api-reference/endpoint/chat-completions</a><p>Playground: We\u2019ve built an \"Arena\" view to run side-by-side comparisons of an Ungoverned vs. Governed model to visualize the intervention delta in real-time. No signup is required: <a href=\"https://playground.ctgt.ai/\">https://playground.ctgt.ai/</a><p>We\u2019d love to hear your feedback on the approach and see what edge cases you can find that break standard models. We will be in the comments all day.
