      "content": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders, including hypertension and cardiovascular disease, yet strategies for safe and precise mitochondrial-targeted delivery remain limited. Here, we establish strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) as a biocompatible, high-fidelity chemical platform for engineering mitochondria-targeted brain-derived exosomes (BR-EVs). Copper-free click conjugation of a mitochondrial-targeting ligand (e.g. Cy5-DBCO) under mild aqueous conditions preserved vesicle morphology (30-150 nm core; 120-200 nm hydrodynamic), proteomic composition, and uptake dynamics. Time-course imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed unaltered endocytic kinetics, >75 % mitochondrial colocalization, and intact organelle architecture. In vivo neuroinflammation and biodistribution analyses demonstrated immunological neutrality, strong central nervous system retention, and minimal peripheral dispersion following intracerebroventricular administration. Proteomic profiling of unlabeled Sprague-Dawley (SD) and hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) BR-EVs uncovered hypertension-driven enrichment of oxidative and complement pathways correlating with mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species generation in neuronal cultures. These findings establish SPAAC-mediated ligand conjugation as a biocompatible and chemically precise approach for generating mitochondria-targeted exosomes that preserve exosomal identity, biodistribution, and signaling fidelity-advancing a foundational platform for organelle-specific delivery and mechanistic imaging in the central nervous system.",

      "title": "Analysis of cortical dysplasias using b-tensor encoding diffusion MRI in an animal model",
      "content": "Cortical dysplasias are malformations of cortical development characterized by disorganization of the cyto- and myeloarchitecture of the neocortex. They are a common cause of epilepsy and their diagnosis through conventional imaging can often be challenging, hindering surgical treatments. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has the ability to infer tissue properties at the microscopic scale, making it a promising technique for detection of cortical dysplasias. This study aims to assess the microarchitecture of the cerebral cortex in a murine model of cortical dysplasia using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) acquired with b-tensor encoding. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either carmustine (BCNU) or saline solution on day 15 of gestation. Their offspring were imaged at 120 days of age using a 7 tesla scanner, acquiring diffusion-sensitive images with b-tensor encoding. Images were processed with Q-space trajectory imaging with positivity constraints (QTI+) to derive various metrics along a curvilinear coordinate system across the neocortex. After scanning, the brains were processed for immunofluorescence and histological examinations. Experimental animals exhibited a significant reduction of microscopic fractional anisotropy ( FA) and anisotropic kurtosis (Ka) in the middle and lateral cortical layers compared to the control animals. Immunofluorescence and histological analysis showed decreased and dysorganized myelinated fibers, and an increase of glial processes in BCNU-treated animals. Given the applicability of b-tensor encoding in clinical scanners, this approach holds promise for improving detection of focal cortical dysplasias in patients with epilepsy.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Working on a new Python library called Code Spy that watches for file changes and automatically runs tasks to keep your code quality high.</p> <p>The project is not designed to replace enterprise level build / deployment CI infrastructure, it's a shortcut for developers working on solo projects that don't have the time to setup all their build tools and want a simple solution to get up &amp; running quickly! I built it for myself, for this very requirement &amp; just opened sourced it as maybe other solo devs might be interested.</p> <h1>What My Projects Does</h1> <p>The library currently supports four types of tasks, each designed to help with a specific part of the development workflow:</p> <p>Type Checking (MyPy) \u2013 Ensures your Python code has the correct type annotations and catches type-related errors early. This helps prevent subtle bugs and makes your code more maintainable.</p> <p>Linting (Pylint) \u2013 Analyzes your code for style, formatting, and potential issues according to configurable rules. It ensures consistency across your codebase and highlights areas for improvement.</p> <p>Testing (Pytest) \u2013 Automatically runs your test suite whenever code changes, helping you catch regressions quickly and maintain confidence in your code.</p> <p>Development Server (WSGI compatible apps) \u2013 Restarts your development server automatically when code changes are detected, making the feedback loop faster during development.</p> <p>Together, these tasks create a streamlined workflow that keeps code clean, correct, and ready for production with minimal manual effort.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>Anyone developing applications that want to easily check their code quality locally in a single terminal with watching / reloading functionality. This is not designed to replace your enterprise CI build pipeline in your day job.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Running any of these tasks manually in separate terminals / saving time having set all this up yourself.</p> <p>Please \u2b50\ufe0f if you find this project interesting: <a href=\"https://github.com/joegasewicz/code-spy\">https://github.com/joegasewicz/code-spy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/joegeezer\"> /u/joegeezer </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1nbp6/python_library_that_watches_your_code_auto_runs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p1nbp6/python_library_that_watches_your_code_auto_runs/\">[comments]</a></span>",
