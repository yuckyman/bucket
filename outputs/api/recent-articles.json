      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

To address such limitations, including various artifact types, insufficient annotations, and low spatial resolutions, we present PhysioMotion Artifact, a large-scale, task-driven EEG dataset with channellevel artifact annotations. EEG data was acquired from 30 healthy participants performing 16 systematically designed single-type and multi-type movement tasks, inducing 14 distinct types of physiological artifacts.

      "content": "Parkinsons Disease (PD) is characterised by accumulation of -synuclein (-Syn), but how elevated -Syn alters presynaptic architecture during prodromal phases of the disease remains unclear. We investigated presynaptic morphology and two key presynaptic proteins: MYCBP2; and the Active Zone (AZ) protein ELKS. Primary rat cortical neurons were transfected with wildtype -Syn, or the familial A30P mutant, and nanoscopic changes to bouton morphology and protein localisation were investigated using super-resolution microscopy. Variant specific accumulation patterns for overexpressed -Syn were observed without changes to bouton structure. Additionally, increases of both -Syn variants affected presynaptic proteins, decreasing MYCBP2 puncta count and intensity, and reducing ELKS protein density. Since MYCBP2 potentially regulates ELKS, these findings suggest that elevated -Syn perturbs AZ components whilst presynaptic structure is preserved. Our study supports growing evidence that increased -Syn disturbs presynaptic function potentially through a MYCBP2-ELKS axis, a mechanism which may provide a valuable target for PD therapeutics.",

      "title": "High-resolution mapping of foveal vision",
      "content": "Human vision critically relies on the foveola, a tiny region of the retina with the highest photoreceptors density. Although it spans only about 0.1% of the visual field, the foveola accounts for nearly one third of projections to the visual cortex. Accurate assessment of foveal function is therefore essential for monitoring visual processes and visual health. However, probing this region is challenging because of its minute size and the incessant eye movements that humans perform, even when fixating on a single point. Here, we leverage recent advances in eye-tracking and gaze-contingent display control to develop a visual field test capable of mapping foveal sensitivity with high precision and reliability. Applied to healthy observers, this method reveals substantial idiosyncratic variability both across and within individuals, with peak sensitivity consistently shifted toward the temporal visual field. By enabling high-resolution individualized assessment of foveal vision, this approach opens new avenues for both clinical diagnostics and basic research.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems.

      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

      "content": "Flavor, a multimodal perception based on taste, smell, and tactile cues, plays a significant role in consumer preferences and purchase intentions toward coffee. In this exploratory study, we assessed the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning (ML) techniques to predict coffee sensory attributes. We extracted spectral and temporal features from a professional panel while tasting coffee samples and basic water solutions. We trained multiple Least-Squares Boosted Trees (LSBoost) and optimized their hyperparameters through a 100-step Bayesian approach based on a Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) scheme. The models achieved, overall, high predictive accuracy (MAE < 0.75 on a 0 \u2212 10 scale) and medium-to-large robustness (Cohen'sd>0.6) with respect to mean and lasso benchmark regressors. Feature importance analysis revealed that spectral powers and Hjorth's parameters within parietal, central, and frontal regions were the most predictive. Our findings endorse the use of EEG-based ML models as an alternative to traditional flavor evaluation methods, such as Descriptive Sensory Analysis (DSA).",

      "content": "Over the past decade, deaths attributable to opioid and stimulant use have risen dramatically. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three medications for opioid use disorder, there is currently no FDA-approved treatment for stimulant use disorder. Despite the availability of medications for opioid use disorder, the rates of relapse and overdose, particularly in the time of widespread fentanyl use, remain distressingly high. There is an urgent need for more effective treatment options for these debilitating disorders. This article provides an overview of the current standard of care for opioid use disorder and stimulant use disorder. New and emerging neuromodulation approaches with a particular focus on deep brain stimulation are then discussed.",

      "title": "Listening to mom in the neonatal intensive care unit: a randomized trial of increased maternal speech exposure on white matter connectivity in infants born preterm",
      "content": "ObjectiveEarly speech experiences are presumed to contribute to the development of brain structures involved in processing speech. Previous research has been limited to correlational studies. Here, we conducted a randomized trial with neonates born preterm to determine whether increased exposure to maternal speech during NICU hospitalization is causally linked to structural white matter maturation.Study designWe enrolled 46 neonates born preterm (24\u201331 weeks gestational age). Participants were randomly assigned to receive increased (T: n = 21) or routine (C: n = 25) exposure to mother\u2019s speech. The T-group heard 10-min audio recordings of their mothers reading a children\u2019s story two times/hour between 10pm and 6am, increasing speech exposure by 2.67 h/day. The C-group did not hear recorded speech. At near-term-equivalent age, we obtained two high-angular resolution diffusion MRI (scan 1: b = 700, scan 2: b = 1500) and T1 relaxometry scans. We assessed mean diffusivity (MD), pre-registered primary outcome (NCT02847689), of the left and right arcuate fasciculus, tracts implicated in language processing. Secondary outcomes included fractional anisotropy (FA) and R1 (1/T1). We hypothesized that neonates randomized to the T-group would show evidence for increased maturation within the arcuate, indexed as decreased MD and increased FA and R1, compared to neonates in the C-group.ResultsGroups were equivalent on medical and demographic variables. Linear mixed models demonstrated that compared to the C-group, the T-group demonstrated significantly lower MD in the left (scan 1: \u03b2 = \u22120.11, Marginal R2 = 0.27; scan 2: \u03b2 = \u22120.12, Marginal R2 = 0.33) but not right arcuate (scan 1: \u03b2 = \u22120.06, Marginal R2 = 0.09; scan 2: \u03b2 = \u22120.03, Marginal R2 = 0.01). The T-group also demonstrated significantly higher FA (scan 1 \u03b2 = 0.02, Marginal R2 = 0.20; scan 2: \u03b2 = 0.03, Marginal R2 = 0.31) and R1 (\u03b2 = 0.02, Marginal R2 = 0.39) in the left but not right arcuate.ConclusionPreterm neonates with increased maternal speech exposure showed more mature left arcuate microstructure, supporting a causal role of exposure to speech in brain development. Enhancing speech exposure in the NICU may benefit preterm children\u2019s language outcomes.",

      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "title": "Remarkable therapeutic effects of methylphenidate in periodic limb movement disorder comorbid with excessive daytime sleepiness: a case report",
      "content": "BackgroundPeriodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is a sleep-related movement disorder, which may be accompanied by a complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). With this study, we reported a clinical therapy process up to 2.5\u202fyears follow-up, exploring the therapeutic effect of a series of medicines in PLMD comorbid EDS.Case presentationA 27-year-old woman suffered from EDS for more than 10\u202fyears and was then diagnosed with PLMD. Initially, we used levodopa 250\u202fmg per night for 12\u202fweeks, then piribedil 50\u202fmg per night was arranged as the second drug for 12\u202fweeks, and the third drug, pramipexole, was prescribed at a dosage of 0.25\u202fmg per night for 12\u202fweeks, but the EDS was persistent despite the periodic leg movement index (PLMI) returning to normal. Finally, methylphenidate was prescribed at a dosage of 18\u202fmg per day after 4\u202fweeks of washout. Then, the indicators of EDS and PLMD all returned to normal after 6\u202fweeks. A 2.5-year follow-up was scheduled for taking methylphenidate; the symptoms of EDS were steadily well controlled, and PLMI was still kept in the normal range.ConclusionThis finding suggests that methylphenidate is an optimal therapeutic approach for the management of PLMD comorbid EDS.",

      "title": "Neural mechanism of HT7 electroacupuncture in myocardial ischemia: critical role of the paraventricular nucleus oxytocin system",
      "content": "ObjectiveElectroacupuncture (EA) at Shenmen (HT7) alleviates acute myocardial ischemia (AMI), but its central neuromodulatory mechanisms remain insufficiently defined. This study investigated whether oxytocinergic (OT) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) mediate the cardioprotective effects of EA and verified causality through chemogenetic interventions.MethodsPart I: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f18) were allocated into three groups: sham, AMI, and AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7 (2\u202fHz/1\u202fmA, 30\u202fmin/day\u202f\u00d7\u202f3\u202fdays). Cardiac function (echocardiography), histopathology (HE/Masson staining), and PVN electrophysiology were evaluated. Part II: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f18) were divided into sham, AMI, and AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7 groups. Mice received AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry and AAV-cre-OT injections into the PVN. EA-induced neuronal activation was quantified by c-Fos and OT co-localization. Part III: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f18) were assigned to chemogenetic activation (OT-activation), inhibition (OT-inhibition), and control (OT-control) groups. Under physiological conditions, the effects of chemogenetic modulation on PVN electrophysiology, electrocardiography, and echocardiography were assessed. Part IV: C57BL/6 mice (n\u202f=\u202f24) were divided into AMI\u202f+\u202fOT-control, AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7\u202f+\u202fOT-control, AMI\u202f+\u202fOT-inhibition, and AMI\u202f+\u202fEA-HT7\u202f+\u202fOT-activation groups. Under pathological conditions, the effects of chemogenetic regulation on PVN physiology and cardiac function were examined.ResultsEA at HT7 improved left ventricular ejection fraction (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), correlating with suppression of PVN neuronal firing. EA specifically inhibited PVNOT neuronal activity (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Under physiological conditions, chemogenetic modulation of PVNOT neurons altered local electrophysiological activity and cardiac performance. In AMI mice, OT neuronal activation reversed EA-induced cardioprotection (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).ConclusionPVN oxytocinergic neurons are both necessary and sufficient for the cardioprotective effects of EA at HT7. Chemogenetic regulation confirms a causal neurocardiac axis, providing mechanistic insights that support precision acupuncture therapies for ischemic heart disease.",
