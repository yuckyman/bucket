      "title": "ZC4H2 loss of function is associated with temporal dysregulation of neural stem proliferation and neuron development",
      "content": "ZC4H2 is an X-linked zinc finger transcription factor essential for early neurodevelopment. Pathogenic variants in ZC4H2 are associated with both central and peripheral nervous system pathologies. The molecular and cellular mechanisms driving these phenotypes remain poorly understood, particularly in human female models that have undergone X chromosome inactivation. Neuronal models were differentiated from a human female cell line with a de novo Xq11.2 deletion causing ZC4H2 loss of function, associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and cognitive impairment. Using iPSC-derived neural stem cells and cortical organoids, we identified premature neuronal differentiation, reduced BMP-SMAD signaling, and decreased SMAD1/5 phosphorylation. In cortical organoids, ZC4H2 deficiency altered neurogenesis timing, retaining proliferative progenitors while prematurely activating neuronal programs, leading to enlarged organoids with persistent dysregulation of gene programs required for complete neuronal maturation. We identified ZC4H2 target genes likely to mediate these phenotypes and tested a codon-optimized transgene showing both the restoration of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, BMPR2 gene expression, and improved neuronal complexity. These results demonstrate effective ZC4H2 restoration in complex human models and highlight therapeutic potential for ZC4H2-linked neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "Computational modeling of resistance to hormone-mediated remission in childhood absence epilepsy",
      "content": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) often resolves during adolescence, a period marked by hormonal and neurosteroid changes associated with puberty. However, remission does not occur in all individuals. To investigate this clinical heterogeneity, we developed a simplified thalamocortical model with a layered cortical structure, using deep-layer intrinsically bursting (IB) neurons to represent frontal cortex and regular spiking (RS) neurons modeling the parietal cortex. By simulating two cortical configurations, we explored how variations in neuronal composition and frontocortical connectivity influence seizure dynamics and the effectiveness of allopregnanolone (ALLO) in resolving pathological spike-wave discharges (SWDs) associated with CAE. While both models exhibited similar physiological and pathological oscillations, only the parietal-dominant network (with a higher proportion of RS neurons in layer 5) recovered from SWDs under increased frontocortical connectivity following ALLO administration. These findings suggest that neuronal composition critically modulates ALLO-mediated resolution of SWDs, providing a mechanistic link between structural connectivity and clinical outcomes in CAE, and highlighting the potential for personalized treatment strategies based on underlying network architecture.",

      "content": "Precision in assessing neurological function after stroke is key to optimizing the efficacy of rehabilitation. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a highly ecologically valid assessment of cortical activation and functional reorganization after stroke by monitoring cortical hemodynamic changes during different tasks. However, the current fNIRS task paradigm lacks systematic integration for standardized design and clinical translation strategies, and fragmented evidence is difficult to converge into actionable practice guidelines. To fill this gap, this paper systematically reviews the application of fNIRS in motor, cognitive, language, and dual-task paradigms in stroke rehabilitation research. It reveals the clinical value of different paradigms for neurological function assessment and proposes adaptive task designs that fit the functional characteristics of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of personalized and ecological paradigms, providing a theoretical basis and practical reference for subsequent standardized research on fNIRS task paradigms and developing clinical application standards.",

      "content": "Predictive coding (PC) has become a central framework in contemporary cognitive neuroscience, proposing that the brain operates as a hierarchical inference system that continuously minimizes the mismatch between predicted and actual sensory input. Its extension into clinical neuroscience has been accompanied by considerable enthusiasm, yet attempts to translate its computational principles into explanations of psychiatric and neurological disorders have yielded uneven results. The present review critically examines the clinical applicability of PC across three diagnostic domains: schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and mood and anxiety disorders. Drawing on findings from neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and computational modeling, the discussion evaluates how disturbances in prediction error signaling, the precision weighting of sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs, and hierarchical inference have been proposed to relate to core clinical phenomena such as hallucinations, sensory hypersensitivity, and affective dysregulation. Particular attention is given to persistent theoretical tensions, including debates surrounding prior precision, the mapping between neural proxies and behavior, and the inconsistent use of PC terminology across diagnostic contexts. By adopting a structured and comparative approach, this review aims to clarify where predictive coding offers testable mechanistic insight into psychopathology, and where its explanatory scope remains limited or provisional.",

The patient\u2019s clinical presentation, imaging characteristics, treatment course, and outcomes were summarized alongside a comprehensive literature review.ResultsThe patient underwent resection of bilateral frontal lobe cysts followed later by resection of a parietal lobe cyst. Postoperative pathology confirmed LCC with calcification and cystic changes. No severe postoperative complications occurred. Follow-up imaging demonstrated gradual cyst regression and symptom resolution. Genetic testing identified heterozygous SNORD118 variants (n.3C>T and n.74G>A).ConclusionSurgical resection is an effective treatment for LCC cysts causing significant mass effect or neurological deficits, requiring regular follow-up. For smaller, asymptomatic cysts without mass effect, treatment with VEGF inhibitors (e.g., bevacizumab) may be beneficial. Management should be individualized.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo examine prefrontal hemodynamic changes in patients with post-stroke anxiety (PSA), both at rest and during cognitive task engagement, with the aim of elucidating the underlying neural mechanisms of PSA and identifying potential neural correlates for clinical application.MethodsFifty patients with PSA and 45 post-stroke patients without anxiety symptoms were recruited. PSA was diagnosed using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA \u2265 7), and comorbid depression was screened using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17 \u2265 8). Patients with significant cognitive impairment were excluded. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to measure resting-state functional connectivity in the frontopolar cortex (FPC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), as well as task-evoked activation during the verbal fluency task (VFT). Demographic and clinical characteristics showed no significant differences between groups except for stroke type. Between-group comparisons were conducted to identify PSA-related differences in prefrontal network characteristics. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the influence of comorbid depression on neural alterations.ResultsThere were no significant differences between the PSA and non-PSA groups in demographic or clinical characteristics, including age, sex, and disease duration (P > 0.05). Compared to the non-PSA group, patients with PSA exhibited significantly reduced activation in the bilateral FPC during the VFT (P < 0.05). Within the PSA group, those with comorbid depression showed further reductions in activation in the bilateral FPC and the left DLPFC (P < 0.05). No significant differences in resting-state functional connectivity were observed between groups (P > 0.05).ConclusionReduced activation in the bilateral FPC may represent a key neural substrate associated with post-stroke anxiety. In addition, altered activation patterns in the bilateral FPC and left DLPFC may reflect neural correlates related to depressive symptoms in patients with PSA, providing candidate targets for future mechanistic and clinical studies.",

      "title": "Association between post-traumatic stress disorder levels and serum inflammatory factors in patients undergoing digit replantation",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo investigate the levels of early postoperative post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their association with serum inflammatory factors in patients undergoing digit replantation, and to analyze the influencing factors.MethodsA total of 96 patients who underwent digit replantation at Rizhao People\u2019s Hospital between March 2022 and December 2024 were enrolled 7\u202fdays postoperatively. PTSD levels were assessed using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Morning fasting blood samples were collected, and serum levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and IL-10 were measured by ELISA. Data were analyzed using univariate analysis, Spearman\u2019s correlation, multiple linear regression, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.ResultsThe mean PCL-C score for the 96 patients was 38.21\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.31, with 44 patients (45.83%) presenting PTSD symptoms. Univariate analysis revealed that gender, education level, injury type, complete amputation, involvement of the dominant hand, and number of amputated digits significantly influenced PCL-C scores (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). PCL-C scores showed positive correlations with both anxiety and depression scores (r\u202f=\u202f0.285 and 0.679, respectively, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Multiple linear regression identified gender, education level, complete amputation, number of injured digits, and levels of anxiety and depression as independent influencing factors for PTSD (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that PCL-C scores were positively correlated with IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 levels (r\u202f=\u202f0.581, 0.521, 0.552, and 0.507, respectively), and negatively correlated with IL-10 (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.474, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). ROC curve analysis suggested that serum inflammatory factors have good predictive value for PTSD.ConclusionPatients exhibit a certain degree of PTSD in the early stage after digit replantation. Its occurrence is closely associated with female gender, lower education level, severity of the trauma, and co-morbid anxiety and depression, and is significantly correlated with an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory serum factors. Serum inflammatory factors may serve as potential biological markers for the early identification of PTSD risk.",

      "title": "Electrical stimulation in upper limb assistance: opportunities and challenges",
      "content": "The global rise in non-communicable diseases, alongside an aging population, is expected to increase the prevalence of motor impairments and, therefore, the need for assistive care. Upper limb impairments can significantly affect independent living and increase long-term care costs. Wearable assistive devices incorporating electrical stimulation (ES) offer a promising solution to support independence and help alleviate pressures on both formal and informal care provision. The development of hybrid systems, which integrate aspects of robotics and electrical stimulation, aim to overcome the limitations associated with single-modality devices. However, there is limited information on the most appropriate electrical stimulation protocols to use, or on what challenges may be faced in doing so. Correspondingly, this narrative review addresses this gap through assessing the role of electrical stimulation in upper limb assistive technology. By evaluating user requirements and identifying challenges with current stimulation strategies, this review highlights the potential benefits of exploring alternative protocols, beyond conventional functional electrical stimulation (FES) techniques, for upper limb assistance. In particular, addressing practical difficulties of stimulation is likely to be critical for successful user uptake and minimizing device abandonment. The paper subsequently reviews several stimulation strategies which may offer novel research directions and opportunities in the development of upper limb assistive technologies.",
