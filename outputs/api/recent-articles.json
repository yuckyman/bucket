      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

However, little is known about fentanyl-induced molecular adaptations in the habenula and amygdala, two brain regions implicated in opioid use and withdrawal. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing in the rat habenula and amygdala to identify transcriptomic changes associated with fentanyl intake. Rats self-administered intravenous saline or fentanyl over 22-24 days. Ninety minutes following the final session, habenula and amygdala were collected for transcriptomic profiling. In Hb, we identified 453 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between saline and fentanyl rats, with upregulated genes associated with synaptic transmission and ionic conductance. In amygdala, we identified 3,041 fentanyl-associated DEGs with upregulated genes implicated in metabolic and vesicular functions. Downregulated genes in both regions were enriched for extracellular matrix functions. Integration of DEGs with single-cell RNA-sequencing data from rodents and humans revealed that fentanyl DEGs were enriched in specific habenula and amygdala cell type markers. Furthermore, fentanyl downregulated DEGs in amygdala were enriched in genes associated with risk for substance use disorders. Together, we define how fentanyl intake alters transcriptional programs in the habenula and amygdala, and we link these changes to specific human cell types and risk genes for neuropsychiatric disorders and addiction.",

      "title": "GPR37 activation erases spinal pain memory and resolves increased nociception in murine models",
      "content": "Intense nociceptor inputs from injury induce long-term changes in the spinal nociceptive system - referred to as spinal pain memory - that increase pain in magnitude and duration. We investigated whether activation of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) at the spinal level can erase this memory and resolve long-lasting, enhanced pain using two animal models: the capsaicin model and the hyperalgesic priming model. Without altering normal mechanical and heat nociception, a single intrathecal (i.th.) administration of two GPR37 agonists, TX14A and protectin D1 (PD1), dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced increase in nociception not only acutely but also long-term. In the hyperalgesic priming model, a single i.th. injection of either GPR37 agonist, given after an initial injury-induced priming, dose-dependently prevented increased nociception following a subsequent inflammatory insult, indicating an unpriming effect. Global GPR37 knockout abolished the long-term inhibitory effect and unpriming effect of i.th. TX14A, confirming the receptor at the spinal level as the molecule mediating the effects. Ex vivo Ca2+ imaging revealed that i.th. TX14A, given in vivo to the capsaicin model a week before imaging, had rescued dorsal horn excitatory and inhibitory interneurons from long-term potentiation and depression of responsiveness to afferent inputs, respectively, suggesting the erasure of capsaicin-induced spinal pain memory. Conditioned place preference tests indicated no obvious abuse liability for centrally-administered GPR37 agonists. These findings suggest that spinally targeted GPR37 agonism represents a promising therapeutic strategy for resolving persistent pain by erasing spinal pain memory.",
