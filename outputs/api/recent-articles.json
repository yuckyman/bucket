      "title": "Neuronal integrity is altered in the ipsilesional hand sensory territory in late stroke",
      "content": "Background: Sensorimotor remapping plays a crucial role in the rehabilitation of hand function after stroke. While motor remapping has been intensively investigated at various levels, from functional to metabolic, limited attention has been given to somatosensory cortical remapping. This study extends our previous work showing functionally relevant metabolic alterations in radiologically normal-appearing or spared motor cortices, predominantly in the ipsilesional (stroke-injured) hemisphere, during the chronic phase of stroke. Precisely, we investigated the metabolic status of the ipsilesional primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and its relation to hand impairment in late stroke. Methods: Fourteen individuals with a chronic (mean {+/-} SD, 21.1 {+/-} 36.9 months post-onset) ischemic subcortical stroke, exhibiting moderate hand impairment (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity, 44.8 {+/-} 20.9; Jamar dynamometer, 54.1% {+/-} 40.9% of the non-paretic hand), but without sensory deficits, and ten matched healthy controls participated. MR Spectroscopy markers of neuronal status (N-acetylaspartate) and neuronal-glial glutamatergic cycle/neurotransmission (glutamate-glutamine complex) were measured in the ipsilesional S1 (3T, Allegra Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). Between-group comparison of brain-tissue-corrected levels of these markers (LCModel, SPM12, MATLAB 2023a) and correlation analyses were performed (SPSS v26). Results: Compared with controls, patients showed significantly lower N-acetylaspartate levels (by 14.5%, p = 0.03) but no significant alterations in glutamate-glutamine levels (by -4.0%, p = 0.6). Significant correlations were found between N-acetylaspartate and the glutamate-glutamine complex in patients (p = 0.02), but not in controls (p = 0.06). No significant correlations were found between S1 markers and hand impairment (p > 0.05 for all). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with lower cortical excitability in the ipsilesional S1 in chronic stroke survivors. Further work on the functional relevance of such findings, using larger sample sizes, is warranted.",

      "title": "Probing the Glymphatic System Using Optical Imaging and Mathematical Modeling",
      "content": "The glymphatic system is a macroscopic waste clearance pathway in the central nervous system (CNS), crucial to maintaining neural homeostasis through the exchange of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF). Impairments in this system have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, emphasizing the need to understand and potentially improve glymphatic clearance. We investigate tracer diffusion and transport in the glymphatic system by combining optical imaging in rats and mathematical modeling using a partial differential equation of advection-diffusion type. The experimental conditions differ in the levels of isoflurane-induced anesthesia (1.5, 2 and 3%) and the molecular weight of the tracer compounds (1 and 160 kDa). The optimal parameters show a close clustering of the diffusion coefficients and a wider spread of the flow velocities of the cerebrospinal fluid. Our work contributes to a better understanding of flow processes in the brain parenchyma during sleep.",
