We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

This approach in particular is highly useful in video surveillance scenarios, where biometric systems allow people to be easily recognized without intruding on their privacy. In the domain of computer vision, one of the essential and most difficult tasks is tracking a person across multiple camera views, specifically,...",

Although incorporating peritumoral information may reduce feature reproducibility, it does not compromise predictive utility. Notably, feature stability is not a strict prerequisite for predictive relevance, highlighting that exclusive reliance on ICC or stability metrics for feature selection may inadvertently discard informative features.",
