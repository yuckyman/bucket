      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "content": "Are actions organized like sentences? Recent evidence showed reciprocal transfer between tool use and syntactic comprehension, reflecting shared basal ganglia (BG) resources for action and language. The proposed mechanism is that embedding a tool into the motor plan increases the hierarchical structure of actions paralleling the organization of sentences. If so, overlap with linguistic computations should emerge specifically during the initiation and/or reach-to-grasp phase, when tool embedding dynamically updates the relation with the target, rather than when the object is stably held in the tool grip. Forty French native speakers underwent fMRI while performing a sentence comprehension (object vs. subject relatives), and a motor task (with pliers vs. hand). Only the reach-to-grasp phase with the tool elicited neural patterns resembling those of object-relatives, within overlapping BG regions. This phase-specific convergence identifies the BG as a hub for domain-general hierarchical computations, unifying syntactic embedding for language and tool use.",

      "title": "Mnemonic maps of visual space in human prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Neural theories of how the prefrontal cortex (PFC) supports working memory rely on evidence from decades of pioneering macaque research. In some respects, efforts to translate these animal models of working memory in human PFC using neuroimaging have largely failed. One possible explanation, before concluding key non-homologies between the species, is that previous neuroimaging studies used resolutions too coarse to be sensitive to intermixed distributions of neurons tuned to memorized features. To resolve this concern, we scanned human PFC at 900 micron resolution using 7T fMRI. We found that population activity in retinotopically-organized superior precentral sulcus, rather than the predicted midlateral PFC, persists during memory, encodes fine-grained information about memorized items, predicts behavioral errors in memory, and forms a stable subspace with a topological organization yoked to visual space. These results have important implications for both functional homologies between the species and theories of how the PFC supports working memory.",

      "title": "Gradual proactive regulation of body state by reinforcement learning of homeostasis",
      "content": "Living systems maintain physiological variables such as temperature, blood pressure, and glucose within narrow ranges; a process known as homeostasis. Homeostasis involves not only reactive feedback but also anticipatory adjustments shaped by experience. Prior homeostatic reinforcement learning (HRL) models have provided a computational account of anticipatory regulation under homeostatic challenges. However, existing formulations lack mechanisms for gradual, trial-by-trial adjustment and for extinction learning. To address this issue, we developed a continuous HRL framework that enables trial-wise tuning of anticipatory regulation. The model incorporates biologically informed components: asymmetric reinforcement, weighting negative outcomes more than positive outcomes; and a dual-unit, context-gated inhibitory mechanism. We applied the framework to thermoregulatory conditioning with ethanol-induced hypothermia and successfully reproduced cue-triggered compensation, gradual tolerance, and rapid reacquisition after extinction. We then extended the framework to multiple physiological variables influenced by shared neural or hormonal control signals, and found that when regulatory priorities across variables were uneven, a deviation in one variable propagated through shared control to others, yielding a cascading, system-wide failure to return to ideal state (non-recovery); a pattern reminiscent of autonomic dysregulation (e.g., dysautonomia, ME/CFS). Overall, our framework provides a computational basis to advances a systems-level understanding of multi-organ homeostatic dysregulation in vivo.",

      "title": "Specific and converging modulation of the CRH and noradrenergic systems across drug classes and natural rewards in an incubation of seeking paradigm",
      "content": "Stress is known to play a critical role in relapse to drug use as well as in food craving. Craving itself is a key determinant of relapse, and cue-induced drug craving has been shown to increase, or incubate, over time for certain drugs such as cocaine and nicotine, though this effect is less consistent for others such as opiates. However, the contribution of stress-related biochemical systems to the incubation of seeking has not yet been systematically examined in animal models, nor has the specificity of these mechanisms been tested across different drug classes or reinforcers. To address this gap, we trained rats to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg, i.v.), heroin (0.075 mg/kg, i.v.), or saline, and subsequently assessed changes in plasma corticosterone, ornithine and other stress-related amines, alongside central gene and protein expression (CRH, CRH2 receptor, and alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor subunits) after 1 or 30 days of withdrawal. A parallel experiment was conducted using sucrose as a reinforcer. Our findings indicate that although most effects were substance-specific, convergent adaptations were also observed, particularly within noradrenergic systems, suggesting that these mechanisms may represent a common substrate of incubation and a potential target for pharmacological interventions in relapse.",

      "title": "Attentional disengagement during external and internal distractions reduces neural speech tracking in background noise",
      "content": "Within-situation disengagement - the mental withdrawal during conversations in acoustically challenging environments - is a common experience of older people with hearing difficulties. Yet, most research on the neural mechanisms of attentional disengagement from speech listening has focused on the distraction by one competing speaker, whereas within-situation disengagement is often characterized by distraction towards external visual stimuli or internal thoughts and occurs in situations with ambient, multi-talker background masking. Across three electroencephalography (EEG) experiments, the current study examined how disengagement due to external and internal distractions affect the neural tracking of speech masked by different levels of multi-talker babble (speech in quiet, +6 dB, and -3 dB SNR). We observed early (<200 ms), enhanced neural responses to the speech envelope for speech masked by background babble compared to speech in quiet (Experiments 1-3), suggesting stochastic facilitation. Importantly, neural tracking of the speech envelope was reduced when individuals were distracted by a visual-stimulus stream (Experiment 2) and by internal thought and imagination (Experiment 3). There were some indices suggesting the greatest disengagement-related decline in neural speech tracking occurs for the most difficult speech-masking condition, but this was not consistent across all measures. The current data show that disengagement due to external and internal distractions yield decreases in neural speech tracking, potentially suggesting a common neural pathway through which gain is downregulated in auditory cortex. These results indicate that disengagement from listening can be identified through non-invasive neural measures.",

      "title": "Cortical Iron in Schizophrenia: A Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Diffusion Tensor Imaging MRI Study",
      "content": "Background and Hypothesis Cognitive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia remain poorly treated. Iron dysregulation has been implicated as a potential mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction and schizophrenia. While elevated postmortem iron in Brodmann areas 10-11 has been linked to schizophrenia, this has not been assessed in vivo. We therefore used iron-sensitive MRI to test whether cortical iron is elevated in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Study Design We acquired quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI to measure magnetic susceptibility ({chi}), a marker of iron, in 158 participants aged 18-45 (73 with schizophrenia and 76 matched healthy controls). As {chi} is reduced by myelin, we conducted diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess mean diffusivity, an iron-insensitive marker also reduced by myelin. Study Results Primary analyses showed no significant case-control differences in {chi} in the whole cortex (p=0.675) or Brodmann areas 10-11 (p=0.537). Exploratory analyses examined {chi} for 362 cortical regions and a voxelwise analysis, correcting for multiple comparisons. Two left temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) junction regions showed significantly elevated {chi} in schizophrenia: the posterior TPO junction (d=0.752, p<0.001) and the superior temporal visual area (d=0.638, p=0.033), which remained significant after adjusting for mean diffusivity and clinical covariates (p=0.001 and p=0.023, respectively). Voxelwise analysis confirmed elevated {chi} in schizophrenia in the left TPO junction (peak t=5.62). Conclusions This study provides the first in vivo evidence of elevated cortical iron in schizophrenia, suggesting regional iron accumulation may contribute to cortical pathology.",

      "title": "DLK inhibition has sex-specific effects on neuroprotection and locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes devastating functional deficits, in part due to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity that drive death of lesion-adjacent viable neurons. One signaling protein that promotes neuronal apoptosis and activates stress-responsive genes is dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), which is a neuron-enriched kinase that responds to extracellular stress by activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. We hypothesized that SCI would robustly activate DLK signaling and that acute pharmacological inhibition of DLK would suppress JNK pathway activation, thereby enhancing neuroprotection and locomotor recovery in our mouse model of moderate contusion SCI. Using western blotting, we observed that SCI induced strong and sustained activation of the JNK pathway in the injured spinal cord starting at 4 hours post-injury through 7 days. Complementary analysis of single-nucleus RNA-seq revealed that DLK expression is highly enriched in neurons across all injury phases. Following SCI, neurons exhibited robust, time-dependent upregulation of multiple DLK-responsive transcripts, consistent with sustained pathway activation during the acute and subacute periods. Systemic treatment with the selective DLK inhibitor IACS'825 effectively suppressed intraspinal JUN activation in a dose-dependent manner. However, unexpectedly, DLK inhibition delayed functional recovery in male mice and expanded lesion volume by 71%, with no significant effect in females. These findings highlight the complex roles of DLK signaling after SCI, revealing a need to understand the sex-specific molecular mechanisms that modulate injury outcomes. Future studies should further optimize timing, location, and cellular targeting of DLK therapeutic strategies to improve neuroprotection and neurologic recovery after SCI.",

      "title": "Innovative 3D-image analysis of cerebellar vascularization highlights angiogenic gene dysregulations in a murine model of apnea of prematurity",
      "content": "Apnea of prematurity (AOP) affects 50% of preterm infants causing intermittent hypoxia (IH), which can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. Cerebellar abnormalities have been observed in AOP but the relationship between vascular alterations and neural development remains unclear. This study investigates how IH affects cerebellar angiogenesis using a murine model of AOP. We developed an innovative 3D imaging workflow combining IMARIS and VesselVio software to quantitatively analyze cerebellar vascularization at different postnatal stages (P4, P8, P12, P21, and P70). We correlate these results with a transcriptomic analysis of 23 angiogenesis-related genes in the same stages to uncover the associated molecular pathways. We found that IH induced significant vascular changes, particularly at P4, with a global increase in vascular-network dimensions. By P8, the vascular network normalized, but genes were downregulated in all pathways studied. After P12, at the end of the IH protocol, transcriptional regulations vary but persist long-term. Moreover, differential analysis showed distinct effects on superficial versus deep vascular networks, allowing for a more precise understanding of remodeling patterns throughout development. Overall, transcriptomic changes were associated with morphological alterations in a time-dependent manner, suggesting a multiphasic IH response through development with lasting effects. Key regulations included VEGF, angiopoietin, and matrix metalloprotease signaling. These findings demonstrate that IH disrupts cerebellar angiogenesis in parallel with neurogenesis, potentially contributing to the neurodevelopmental deficits observed in AOP. Thus, the interconnected nature of angio- and neurogenesis during cerebellar development makes it crucial to take vascular aspects into account in therapeutic approaches to neurodevelopmental disorders.",

      "title": "C. elegans astrocytes mature in two phases from lineally distinct progenitors through CEH-43/DLX-mediated convergent transcription",
      "content": "Astrocytic glia regulate brain assembly, synapse formation/activity, neuronal energetics, and brain metabolism. Gene programs driving astrocyte specification are only partly understood. Here, we use lineage-restricted single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover a two-phase developmental program for C. elegans CEPsh astrocyte differentiation. In phase one, newly generated astrocytes acquire common transcription profiles despite arising from lineally and transcriptionally distinct progenitors. Convergent differentiation is mediated by the distal-less transcription factor CEH-43. CEH-43 is expressed in astrocytes and their progenitors, binds conserved astrocyte-expressed genes, and cell-autonomously controls astrocyte-specific gene expression. Forced misexpression of CEH-43 in the embryo promotes ectopic expression of astrocyte-specific reporters. The second gene expression phase, directing astrocyte maturation, is also under CEH-43 control. Homologs of CEPsh astrocyte-enriched genes are preferentially enriched in mammalian astrocytes, and the CEH-43 homologs DLX1/2 are expressed in mouse astrocytes. Our findings suggest parallels between CEPsh and mammalian astrocyte development, implicating conserved regulators in astrocyte cell-fate acquisition.",

      "title": "Hierarchical regulation of cerebellar neurogenesis by Sin3A-mediated gene repression",
      "content": "Cerebellar granule cells (GCs) are critical for motor and cognitive functions. Lineage tracing studies have identified a hierarchical developmental progression of GC neurogenesis, transitioning from Sox2+ stem-like cells to Atoh1+ rapidly proliferating granule cell precursors (GCPs), and ultimately to NeuN+ mature GCs. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these transitions remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified a transient, slow-cycling progenitor population defined by co-expression of Sox2 and Atoh1. We show that GC maturation depends critically on the repressive function of the Sin3A/Hdac1 complex, which sequentially silences Sox2 and then Atoh1 to ensure orderly progression through developmental stages. Loss of these repressions prolongs progenitor states, compromises survival, and markedly reduces GC output. We also identify NeuroD1 as a co-repressor that collaborates with Sin3A/Hdac1 to inhibit Atoh1 transcription. Our findings highlight the central role of the Sin3A complex in orchestrating distinct stages of cerebellar GC lineage development and may provide insights into Sin3A-related cerebellar disorders and medulloblastoma in human.",
