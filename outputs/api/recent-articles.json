      "title": "HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface With Hierarchical Force Control",
      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

      "content": "While vibrotactile displays continue to gain popularity, it remains that the phenomenon of tactile change blindness negatively impacts the human ability to detect changes between and within tactile signals. This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

      "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
      "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

      "title": "Multi-modal and multi-region distance model for neuroimaging: Application to ABCD study",
      "content": "Large-scale neuroimaging studies often collect multiple modalities, such as task and resting-state functional MRI, diffusion MRI, and structural MRI. Joint inference across these modalities uses shared variation to improve statistical efficiency, increase replicability, and provide a more integrated view of brain-phenotype associations. In practice, however, such analyses are limited because complex cross-modality covariance cannot be flexibly modeled, which makes the resulting joint effects difficult to interpret. A recent distance-based ANOVA extension allows multimodal analysis and increases power for detecting group differences, but it cannot easily distinguish location from scale effects in distance space, offers only an omnibus pseudo-F test without interpretable parameters, and requires computationally intensive permutation inference. We propose a novel semiparametric, U-statistics-based Generalized Estimating Equation (UGEE) framework that unifies univariate and multivariate distance models. By regressing pairwise dissimilarities on covariates, this method yields interpretable regression coefficients that disentangle location and scale effects and quantify inter-modality differences, while flexibly accounting for correlations among modality distances. The estimator is based on efficient influence functions, ensuring asymptotic efficiency, robustness to misspecification, and computational scalability for large-scale data analysis. We evaluate the proposed method through extensive simulations and analyses of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset. Results show that UGEE accurately estimates modality, group, and interaction effects and achieves a 100-fold speed-up compared with permutation-based approaches. This framework provides a general and computationally efficient tool for semiparametric inference on multimodal data, particularly suited for large neuroimaging applications.",

      "title": "PRISME: A MATLAB Toolbox For Large Data-Driven Multimodal Power Benchmarking",
      "content": "Low statistical power in neuroimaging often undermines research in the field, leading to missed effects, wasted resources, and reduced reproducibility. Performing power analyses during the study design phase is extremely important, but often prohibitively difficult due to a lack of analytical solutions and high computational costs. We present PRISME (Power Resampling Infrastructure for Statistical Method Evaluation), a MATLAB toolbox for neuroimaging power benchmarking. PRISME provides a computational framework for empirical power analysis independent of inference methods, enabling large scale power benchmarking and method comparison.The toolbox supports diverse neuroimaging data types, including both voxel-based activation and functional connectivity analyses, with a non-parametric, flexible algorithm and unified data representations. Furthermore, unlike previous empirical power approaches, PRISME supports multiple test types, such as association and difference tests with behavioral and clinical measures. Finally, PRISME's $25times$ speedup from algorithmic optimizations enables larger-scale power benchmarking, including the first power analysis for the ABCD dataset. Overall, PRISME is the first method- and data-type-agnostic power benchmarking tool for neuroimaging, providing a single solution for power analysis across diverse study designs.",

      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder lacking disease-modifying therapies, and its management is limited by the absence of accessible biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response. We implemented an ultra-deep plasma proteomics workflow integrating Mag-Net extracellular vesicle enrichment with Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometry to profile longitudinal samples from PD patients. This approach quantified 6,481 plasma proteins, an unprecedented depth in PD studies, revealing distinct signatures associated with disease duration and dopaminergic therapy exposure. Candidate biomarkers were validated in an independent cohort using ELISA, demonstrating predictive utility in AI-driven models. To uncover mechanistic drivers, we intersected proteomic data with our new genome-wide overexpression screens for regulators of alpha-synuclein pre-formed fibril uptake, identifying MFN2, PSMD4, and EIF4G1 as major hubs that link systemic proteomic changes to mitochondrial dynamics and proteostasis. Additionally, a meta-analysis of brain transcriptomes responsive to Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment identified 42 candidate genes, including NDUFS4, GNAS, TSC1, and NTS, some of which are targets of approved therapeutics. Finally, an integrative network analysis revealed that key pathological hubs, such as IFNG and PLAT, are targets of approved pharmacological agents. Overall, these findings provide a systems-level resource for PD biomarker discovery and reveal druggable pathways for precision medicine strategies aimed at improving therapeutic outcomes.",

      "title": "Dying oligodendrocytes persist without mitochondria",
      "content": "Myelin is an insulating, multi-layered membrane that supports axonal integrity and neural communication. Different stressors impair myelinating oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. The intracellular processes underlying oligodendrocyte degeneration and death are unclear. Here, using optically targeted DNA damage that causes single-cell demyelination, we reveal that injured mature oligodendrocytes lose mitochondria within days and persist without them for weeks to months before cell death. This differs from other oligodendrocyte lineage cells, which exhibit acute mitochondrial changes followed by rapid cell death. Conditional deletion of the mitochondrial-related gene, Fis1, in mature oligodendrocytes, similarly causes acute loss of mitochondria and prolonged cell death. The unique cell death is characterized by nuclear changes, intracellular stress, and markers of disease-associated oligodendrocytes. Thus, mitochondrial loss may be an early marker of oligodendrocyte pathology, and mitochondrial quality control is required for oligodendrocyte and myelin homeostasis.",
