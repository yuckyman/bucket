      "title": "What Pulls the Strings? Understanding the Characteristics and Role of Argumentation in Open-Source Software Usability Discussions",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08032v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The usability of open-source software (OSS) is important but frequently overlooked in favor of technical and functional complexity. Argumentation can be a pivotal device for diverse stakeholders in OSS usability discussions to express opinions and persuade others. However, the characteristics of argument discourse in those discussions remain unknown, resulting in difficulties in providing effective support for discussion participants. We address this through a comprehensive analysis of argument discourse and quality in five OSS projects. Our results indicated that usability discussions are predominantly argument-driven, although their qualities vary. Issue comments exhibit lower-quality arguments than the issue posts, suggesting a shortage of collective intelligence about usability in OSS communities. Moreover, argument discourse and quality have various impacts on the subsequent behavior of participants. Overall, this research offers insights to help OSS stakeholders build more effective arguments and eventually improve OSS usability. These insights can also inform studies about other distributed collaborative communities.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08009v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Neurological injuries and age-related decline can impair sensory processing and disrupt motor coordination, gait, and balance. As mechanisms of neuroplasticity have become better understood, vibration-based interventions have gained attention as potential tools to stimulate sensory pathways and motor circuits to support functional recovery. This survey reviews stochastic and resonant vibration modalities, describing their mechanisms, therapeutic rationales, and clinical applications. We synthesize evidence on whole-body vibration for improving balance, mobility, and fine motor function in aging adults, stroke survivors, and individuals with Parkinson's disease, with attention to challenges in parameter optimization, generalizability, and safety. We also assess recent developments in focused muscle vibration and wearable stochastic resonance devices for upper-limb rehabilitation, evaluating their clinical promise along with limitations in scalability, ecological validity, and standardization. Across these modalities, we identify key variables that shape therapeutic outcomes and highlight ongoing efforts to refine protocols, improve usability, and integrate vibration techniques into broader neurorehabilitation frameworks. We conclude by outlining the most important research needs for translating vibration-based interventions into reliable and deployable clinical tools.",

This work introduces HOLE (Homological Observation of Latent Embeddings), a method for analyzing and interpreting deep neural networks through persistent homology. HOLE extracts topological features from neural activations and presents them using a suite of visualization techniques, including Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, dendrograms, and blob graphs. These tools facilitate the examination of representation structure and quality across layers. We evaluate HOLE on standard datasets using a range of discriminative models, focusing on representation quality, interpretability across layers, and robustness to input perturbations and model compression. The results indicate that topological analysis reveals patterns associated with class separation, feature disentanglement, and model robustness, providing a complementary perspective for understanding and improving deep learning systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08839v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: There is accelerating interest in sign language technologies (SLTs), with increasing attention from both industry and academia. However, the perspectives of Deaf and Hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals remain marginalized in their development, particularly those outside of the West and in the global South. This paper presents findings from a global, multilingual survey capturing community views on SLTs across a wide range of countries, sign languages, and cultural contexts. While participants recognized the potential of SLTs to support access and independence, many expressed concerns about cultural erasure, inaccurate translation, and hearing-dominated research pipelines. Perceptions of SLTs were shaped by factors including sign language proficiency, policy exposure, and deaf identity. Across regions, participants emphasized the importance of DHH-led design, citing the risk of harm when DHH communities are excluded from technological decision-making. This study offers a novel cross-continental, community-informed analysis of SLTs and concludes with actionable recommendations for researchers, technologists, and policymakers.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08787v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Collective memory -- community members' interconnected memories and impressions of the group -- is essential to the community's culture and identity. Its development requires members' continuous participatory contribution and sensemaking. However, existing works mainly adopt a holistic sociological perspective to analyze well-developed collective memory, less focusing on member-level conceptualization of this possession or what the co-contribution practices can be. Therefore, this work alternatively adopts the latter perspective and probes such interpretative and interactional patterns with two mobile systems. With one being a locative narrative and exploration system condensed from existing literature's design frameworks, and the other being a conventional online forum representing current practices, they served as the anchors of observation for our two-week, mixed-methods field study (n=38) on a university campus. A core debate we have identified was to retrospectively contemplate or document the presence as a history for the future. This also subsequently impacted the narrative focuses, expectations of collective memory constituents, and the ways participants seek inspiration from the group. We further extracted design considerations that could better embrace the diverse conceptualizations of collective memory and bond different community members together. Lastly, revisiting and reflecting on our design, we provided extra insights on designing devoted locative narrative experiences for community-driven UGC platforms.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.08437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Charging electric vehicles (EVs) with renewable energy can lessen their environmental impact. However, the fluctuating availability of renewable energy affects the sustainability of public EV charging stations. Nearby public charging stations may utilize differing energy sources due to their microgrid connections - ranging from exclusively renewable to non-renewable or a combination of both - highlighting the substantial variability in energy supply types within short distances. This study investigates the near-future scenario of integrating dynamic renewable energy availability in charging station navigation to impact the choices of EV users towards renewable sources. We conducted a within-subjects design survey with 50 car users and semi-structured interviews with 10 EV users from rural, suburban, and urban areas. The results show that when choosing EV charging stations, drivers often prioritize either time savings or money savings based on the driving scenarios that influence drivers' consumer value. Notably, EV users tend to select renewable-powered stations when they align with their main priority, be it saving money or time. This study offers end-user insights into the front-end graphic user interface and the development of the back-end ranking algorithm for navigation recommender systems that integrate dynamic renewable energy availability for the sustainable use of electric vehicles.",

Otherwise, we will be at risk of experiencing loneliness or depression. In human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), robotic systems offer nuanced approaches to foster human connection, providing interaction beyond the traditional mediums that smartphones and computers offer. However, many existing studies primarily focus on the humanrobot relationships that older adults form directly with robotic pets rather than exploring how these robotic pets can enhance human-human relationships. Our ethnographic study investigates how robotic pets can be designed to facilitate human relationships. Through semi-structured interviews with six older adults and thematic analysis, our empirical findings provide insights into how robotic pets can be designed as telerobots to connect with others remotely, thus contributing to advance future development of robotic systems for mental health.",

Designing for joint activity focuses on explicitly supporting the interdependencies between agents necessary for effective coordination among agents engaged in the joint activity. This builds and expands upon designing for usability to further address how technologies can be designed to act as effective team players. Effective joint activity requires supporting, at minimum, five primary macrocognitive functions within teams: Event Detection, Sensemaking, Adaptability, Perspective-Shifting, and Coordination. Supporting these functions is equally as important as making technologies usable. We synthesized fourteen heuristics from relevant literature including display design, human factors, cognitive systems engineering, cognitive psychology, and computer science to aid the design, development, and evaluation of technologies that support joint human-machine activity.",

Previous efforts to promote privacy protection have largely focused on top-down approaches such as regulation and technology design, missing opportunities to understand how to empower users through bottom-up, collective approaches. Our paper addresses this by analyzing what and how privacy-related topics are discussed on Quora. We identified a wide range of interconnected privacy topics brought up by the users, including privacy risks and dangers, protection strategies, organizational practices, and existing laws and regulations. Our results highlight the interplay among the individual, technological, organizational, and societal factors affecting users' privacy attitudes. Moreover, we provide implications for designing community-based tools to better support users' collective efforts in navigating privacy, tools that incorporate users' diverse privacy-related behaviors and preferences, simplify information access and sharing, and connect designers and developers with the user community.",

      "title": "A Comparative Study of EMG- and IMU-based Gesture Recognition at the Wrist and Forearm",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.07997v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Gestures are an integral part of our daily interactions with the environment. Hand gesture recognition (HGR) is the process of interpreting human intent through various input modalities, such as visual data (images and videos) and bio-signals. Bio-signals are widely used in HGR due to their ability to be captured non-invasively via sensors placed on the arm. Among these, surface electromyography (sEMG), which measures the electrical activity of muscles, is the most extensively studied modality. However, less-explored alternatives such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) can provide complementary information on subtle muscle movements, which makes them valuable for gesture recognition. In this study, we investigate the potential of using IMU signals from different muscle groups to capture user intent. Our results demonstrate that IMU signals contain sufficient information to serve as the sole input sensor for static gesture recognition. Moreover, we compare different muscle groups and check the quality of pattern recognition on individual muscle groups. We further found that tendon-induced micro-movement captured by IMUs is a major contributor to static gesture recognition. We believe that leveraging muscle micro-movement information can enhance the usability of prosthetic arms for amputees. This approach also offers new possibilities for hand gesture recognition in fields such as robotics, teleoperation, sign language interpretation, and beyond.",

      "content": "arXiv:2505.24580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In this commentary, we argue that El Hady and Machta's \"surface wave\" model for mechanical waves accompanying action potential (AP) propagation describes the same underlying process as the \"axoplasmic pressure wave\" model introduced earlier by Rvachev. Both models describe mechanical modes that store potential energy in the elastic components of the axon (axonal membrane, cytoskeleton, bulk axoplasmic deformation), with kinetic energy carried by the axoplasmic fluid and axoplasmic viscosity playing a significant role. The \"surface wave\" model quantitatively considers driving by the traveling electrical depolarization wave of the AP, whereas the \"axoplasmic pressure wave\" model qualitatively considers driving not only by the AP's electrical depolarization but also by other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal actomyosin contractility. In addition, the \"axoplasmic pressure wave\" model considers mechanisms for synchronizing the depolarization wave and the pressure wave. Although derived using different approaches, the two models yield identical dependencies for the mechanical modes in key limits. The confusion in the literature, which treats these models as describing distinct processes, needs to be resolved to improve comprehensive understanding of the AP phenomenon and to guide future research.",

      "title": "Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations",
      "content": "arXiv:2507.00269v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate: feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3% reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve 16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant statistical interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.",

      "title": "How random connectivity shapes the fluctuating dynamics of finite-size neural populations",
      "content": "arXiv:2412.16111v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Mesoscopic models of finite-size neuronal populations are crucial to understand the dynamics of neural networks in the brain, especially their fluctuations and response to stimuli. However, current theories to derive such models are based on homogeneous all-to-all (full) connectivity. This assumption neglects the variance in the connectivity of biologically realistic networks with connection probabilities $p<1$ (non-full connectivity). To gain insight into the different fluctuation mechanisms underlying neural variability at the population level, we derive and analyze a stochastic mean-field model for finite-size networks of Poisson neurons with random connectivity (including non-full connectivity), external noise and disordered mean inputs. We treat the quenched disorder of the connectivity by an annealed approximation enabling a doubly stochastic description of synaptic inputs for finite network size. A further reduction leads to a low-dimensional closed system of coupled Langevin equations for the mean and variance of the membrane potentials as well as a variable capturing finite-size fluctuations. Compared to microscopic simulations, the mesoscopic model describes the fluctuations and nonlinearities well and outperforms previous theories that neglected the variance in the connectivity. The joint effect of connectivity disorder and finite network size can be analytically understood by a softening of the effective nonlinearity and the multiplicative character of spiking noise. The mesoscopic theory shows that quenched disorder can stabilize the asynchronous state, and it correctly predicts large quantitative and non-trivial qualitative effects of connection probability on the variance of the population firing rate and its dependence on stimulus strength. In conclusion, our theory elucidates how disordered connectivity shapes nonlinear dynamics and fluctuations of neural populations.",

      "title": "Sleep effects on brain, cognition, and mental health during adolescence are mediated by the glymphatic system",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08704v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Background: Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation and heightened vulnerability to cognitive and mental health disorders. Sleep plays a vital role in neurodevelopment, yet the mechanisms linking insufficient sleep to adverse brain and behavioral outcomes remain unclear. The glymphatic system (GS), a brain-wide clearance pathway, may provide a key mechanistic link. Methods: Participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n =6,800; age ~ 11 years) were categorized into sleep-sufficient (>=9 h/night) and sleep-insufficient (<9 h/night) groups. Linear models tested associations among sleep, PVS burden, brain volumes, and behavioral outcomes. Mediation analyses evaluated whether PVS burden explained sleep-related effects. Results: Adolescents with insufficient sleep exhibited significantly greater PVS burden, reduced cortical, subcortical, and white matter volumes, poorer cognitive performance across multiple domains (largest effect in crystallized intelligence), and elevated psychopathology (largest effect in general problems). Sleep duration and quality were strongly associated with PVS burden. Mediation analyses revealed that PVS burden partially mediated sleep effects on cognition and mental health, with indirect proportions up to 10.9%. Sequential models suggested a pathway from sleep -> PVS -> brain volume -> behavior as the most plausible route. Conclusions: Insufficient sleep during adolescence is linked to glymphatic dysfunction, reflected by increased PVS burden, which partially accounts for adverse effects on brain structure, cognition, and mental health. These findings highlight the GS as a potential mechanistic pathway and imaging biomarker, underscoring the importance of promoting adequate sleep to support neurodevelopment and mental health.",

      "title": "Multi state neurons",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.08815v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurons, as eukaryotic cells, have powerful internal computation capabilities. One neuron can have many distinct states, and brains can use this capability. Processes of neuron growth and maintenance use chemical signalling between cell bodies and synapses, ferrying chemical messengers over microtubules and actin fibres within cells. These processes are computations which, while slower than neural electrical signalling, could allow any neuron to change its state over intervals of seconds or minutes. Based on its state, a single neuron can selectively de-activate some of its synapses, sculpting a dynamic neural net from the static neural connections of the brain. Without this dynamic selection, the static neural networks in brains are too amorphous and dilute to do the computations of neural cognitive models. The use of multi-state neurons in animal brains is illustrated in hierarchical Bayesian object recognition. Multi-state neurons may support a design which is more efficient than two-state neurons, and scales better as object complexity increases. Brains could have evolved to use multi-state neurons. Multi-state neurons could be used in artificial neural networks, to use a kind of non-Hebbian learning which is faster and more focused and controllable than traditional neural net learning. This possibility has not yet been explored in computational models.",

The core message here is modest: the paper offers an interesting analogy and an eye-catching fit, but several key steps mix physical claims with definitions and curve-fitting choices. We highlight three such points: (i) a normalization issue that is presented as \"bosonic enhancement\", (ii) an identification of rank with energy that makes the BE fit only weakly diagnostic of an underlying mechanism, and (iii) a baseline comparison that is too weak to support an ontological conclusion. We also briefly flag a few additional concerns (interpretation drift, parameter semantics, and reproducibility).",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.07869v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for under- standing brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding man- ifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns; while the readout module achieves biological fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, we present this work as a study of the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns.",

Modelling efforts aim to relate the neural rhythms present in cortical recordings to the underlying dynamics responsible for their emergence. We present an effort to characterize the neural activity from the cortex of a mouse during natural sleep, captured through local field potential measurements. Our approach relies on using a discretized Wilson--Cowan Amari neural field model for neural activity, along with a data assimilation method that allows the Bayesian joint estimation of the state and parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on synthetic measurements before applying it to a dataset available in literature. Our findings suggest the potential of our approach to characterize the stimulus received by the cortex from other brain regions, while simultaneously inferring a state that aligns with the observed signal.",
