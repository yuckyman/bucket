      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>This is a minimal Python project template I'm using when I spin up small repos. It gives you a ready-to-go structure with src/tests/docs, plus tooling for formatting, linting, testing, type-checking, and dependency management. Out of the box it wires up Black, Ruff, mypy, pytest, pip-tools, pre-commit, and a simple GitHub Actions CI workflow, all driven through invoke tasks so you can run the same commands locally and in CI. </p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This is mainly aimed at people who create a lot of small to medium Python projects and want a clean, modern starting point without a lot of extra complexity. It\u2019s intended for real use (not just a toy), but it deliberately stays lightweight so you can delete or extend pieces as needed. I\u2019ve focused on Python 3.13+ and tried to keep it friendly for Linux/macOS and reasonably compatible with Windows by avoiding make and centralizing commands in tasks.py. </p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Compared to many full-featured templates, this one is intentionally small and opinionated rather than trying to cover every use case. It doesn\u2019t include heavy documentation systems or complex multi-environment setups; instead it focuses on a simple, consistent workflow: invoke for tasks, pip-tools for dependencies, and pyproject.toml for tool configuration. If you want a modern baseline with Black/Ruff/mypy/pytest/pre-commit already integrated, but don\u2019t want to wade through a large scaffold, this might be a useful middle ground.</p> <p>Github Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/sesopenko/python-template\">https://github.com/sesopenko/python-template</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kwirky88\"> /u/kwirky88 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pg10u3/a_small_modern_python_project_template_im_using/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pg10u3/a_small_modern_python_project_template_im_using/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Pairing extinction training with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) reduces drug-seeking by altering activity in afferents to the medial prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Relapse triggered by drug-associated cues or stress remains a major challenge in treating substance use disorders (SUDs), as re-exposure reliably provokes craving and reinstatement of drug seeking. Extinction-based interventions can reduce cue reactivity, yet extinction learning is often weak or context-dependent, limiting its clinical impact. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) enhances learning-related plasticity via widespread engagement of neuromodulatory systems and cortical circuits. Recent preclinical work shows that pairing extinction with VNS facilitates extinction learning and reduces cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, suggesting translational potential as an adjunct to exposure-based therapies. However, the circuit-level mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. To address this gap, we examined how VNS paired with extinction alters activity in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) networks that regulate drug seeking, focusing specifically on afferent projections from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC). Male rats received retrograde AAV-eGFP infusions into either the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) cortex to label upstream projections, followed by cocaine self-administration, extinction training with VNS or sham stimulation, and cue-induced reinstatement. cFos immunolabeling in the BLA and vHPC revealed pathway-specific modulation: VNS decreased overall BLA activity and reduced activation of BLA to IL projections, but increased activation of BLA to PL projections. In the vHPC, VNS selectively decreased activation of vHPC to IL projections without affecting PL-projecting neurons. Because these pathways synapse onto parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs) in the mPFC, we quantified PVI activation and found that VNS decreased overall prefrontal cFos expression, but increased PVI activity in the PL, and decreased PVI activity in the IL. Together, these results demonstrate that VNS paired with extinction reshapes prefrontal-amygdala-hippocampal circuits in a pathway-specific manner, potentially modulating feed-forward inhibition to reduce relapse-like behavior. These findings support VNS as a promising strategy to strengthen extinction learning and improve treatment outcomes in SUD.",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",
