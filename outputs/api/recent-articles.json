      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "title": "Why Consciousness Should Explain Physical Phenomena: Toward a Testable Theory",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.04047v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.",

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models.

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",

      "title": "Intrinsic excitability controls structural plasticity of cerebellar climbing fibers",
      "content": "In the cerebellum, climbing fibers (CFs) convey a teaching signal to Purkinje cells (PCs) that is crucial for cerebellar learning. They undergo activity-dependent synaptic plasticity during development and learning, and their transverse branches have an activity-dependent control of mobility. The maintenance of their structure was shown to rely on the growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), which is highly expressed in these fibers under basal conditions in adults and which is controlled by intracellular calcium levels and phosphorylation. Although activity-dependent structural plasticity occurs in several axonal fibers throughout the brain, it remains unclear whether this is also the case for the main branches of CFs. Here, we investigate this issue using in vivo knock-down of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) in the CF-generating neurons of the inferior olive, and analyzing CF three-dimensional morphology, density and function of synaptic contacts with PCs. We show that the decrease in intrinsic excitability causes a reduction in the number and length of CF branches and that similar effects are caused by the knockdown of GAP-43, suggesting that GAP-43 may mediate this response. We also show that the retraction of CF fibers is associated with a seemingly compensatory increase in the density of CF synaptic terminals and PC dendritic spines, specifically in the area where PCs receive CF inputs. These plastic modifications are associated with a decrease in paired-pulse ratio and an increase in the kinetics and transferred charge of synaptic currents. Our data show that CFs can undergo activity-dependent structural plasticity changes affecting synaptic transmission and suggest the possibility that they contribute to encoding memories in the cerebellum and, if disrupted, to the pathophysiology of cerebellar diseases.",

      "title": "Experience-Dependent Plasticity of Thalamoprefrontal Circuitry Characterizes Learning Across Species",
      "content": "Learning is an adaptive process which is thought to require precise coordination among multiple brain regions over time. Thalamoprefrontal circuitry is central to multiple domains of cognitive control and executive function, yet its evolution during learning is not characterized. In this study, we explored thalamoprefrontal circuit signaling in mice and connectivity dynamics in humans over the course of learning a homologous psychomotor task. In mice, we targeted a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator to the mediodorsal-prefrontal (MdT-dmPFC) projection and used fiber photometry to record synaptic dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activity. As learning sessions progressed, all mice demonstrated a decrease in reaction time (RT) performance on successful trials (p<0.001). In concomitant synaptic MdT-dmPFC circuit activity across sessions, we observed a significant increase in activity during the anticipatory (p<0.01) and reward retrieval (p<0.01) periods, and a non-significant trend towards an increase in preparatory activity (p<0.15). However, following the learning period, during task re-exposure, we observed a significant shift in circuit activity, away from anticipatory (p<0.001) and towards the preparatory period (p<0.001) over the course of re-exposure sessions. Furthermore, we observed an emergence of a learner (decrease in RT) and a non-learner group (increase in RT) during the task re-exposure period. Over the course of a single analogous task session in humans, we also observed a learner and a non-learner group. When analyzing the thalamoprefrontal regional connectivity dynamics of early and late trials for learners, we observed a significant increase in low frequency and decrease in high frequency synchrony (connectivity tilt) in thalamoprefrontal pathways during preparatory and anticipatory periods. Interestingly, pairwise interactions specifically between the anterior corona radiata (ACR) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the human homolog to the genetically targeted MdT-dmPFC circuitry in mice, in fact demonstrated a robustly opposite connectivity tilt effect distinguishing learners from non-learners (Cohens d > 2). Overall, these findings may provide cross-species evidence of novel, conserved thalamoprefrontal circuit mechanisms of adaptive learning.",
