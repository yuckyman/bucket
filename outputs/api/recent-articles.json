      "title": "Dissecting the strain and sex specific connectome signatures of unanesthetized C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice using magnetic resonance imaging",
      "content": "Mouse models are an essential tool for understanding behavior and disease states in neuroscience research. While genetic and sex-specific effects have been reported in many neurodegenerative and psychiatric illnesses, these factors may also alter baseline neuroanatomical features of mice. This raises the question of whether the observed changes are related to the disease being studied (i.e., pathological differences) or if there are baseline strain or sex differences that may potentially predispose animals to different responses. Over the past decade, tremendous effort has been made in mapping neural architecture at various scales; however, the complex relationships including identifying genetic and sex-specific differences in brain structure and function remain understudied. To bridge this gap, we used C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, two of the most widely used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research, to investigate strain and sex-specific features of the brain connectome in awake animals using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By combining resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI, we found that the motor, sensory, limbic, and salience networks exhibit significant differences in both functional and structural domains between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. Further, functional and structural properties of the brain were significantly correlated in both strains. Our results underscore the importance of considering these baseline differences when interpreting the brain-behavior interactions in mouse models of human disorders.",

      "title": "Compensatory responses to glaucoma pathology in the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus",
      "content": "Glaucoma disrupts the conveyance of retinal signals to visual regions of the brain such as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Although plasticity during development allows altered visual experience to modulate dLGN synapses and excitability, evidence for experience-dependent dLGN plasticity in adults is limited. However, glaucoma might trigger compensatory plasticity in adult dLGN, thereby compensating for diminished RGC synaptic drive. Here, we tested this using aged (11-15 month-old) DBA/2J mice, which develop high intraocular pressure and glaucoma. In brain slice recordings, we found that diminished RGC inputs could drive robust action potential firing in dLGN relay neurons that was comparable to controls. This was accompanied by increased intrinsic excitability and decreased magnitude of sustained inhibitory currents from GABA spillover to extrasynaptic receptors. These results implicate multiple cellular and synaptic mechanisms that support signaling despite the diminished RGC inputs in glaucoma.",

      "title": "Non-invasive longitudinal imaging reveals aging-associated changes in neuroimmune cells in adult zebrafish",
      "content": "Zebrafish are a powerful model for imaging studies of development and neurobiology. However, most studies have focused on developing zebrafish due to technical and biological challenges of imaging adult stages. These include increased tissue opacity and illumination depth limitations, and difficulty maintaining life support and anesthesia in a 2-4cm long fish. There are currently limited tools for intravital imaging of the adult zebrafish brain. The ability to image the brain in the same individual repeatedly without physical damage would allow zebrafish to be better utilized to study aging and neurodegenerative disease. We designed and applied a 3D-printable device for non-invasive, repeatable multiphoton neural imaging of genetically non-pigmented adult zebrafish from 2 months to 2 years old. Animals successfully recovered after multi-hour imaging sessions and could be imaged repeatedly over periods of weeks to years. We show the utility of this approach through imaging the neuroimmune system, revealing that microglia in aged zebrafish have enhanced cellular dynamics. This technique could be widely used and beneficial for other cell-scale neuroimaging studies in the adult fish.",

      "title": "Deciphering the circular RNAs landscape in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, with most cases lacking a clear genetic basis. Emerging evidence highlights the involvement of non-coding RNAs, particularly circular RNAs (circRNAs), in disease onset and progression. In this study, we investigated circRNAs implicated in ALS and related motor neuron diseases (MNDs). First, we conducted a systematic review to identify ALS-associated circRNAs, followed by in silico analyses of 15 selected candidates. Our results revealed that hsa-circ-0000099, hsa-circ-0001017, hsa-circ-004846, and hsa-circ-0034880 regulate a high number of ALS-related genes through miRNA sponging. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that hsa-circ-0000099 is particularly involved in unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. Protein-RNA interaction analysis further showed that ALS-related circRNAs can sponge 20 RNA-binding proteins, with FMR1, ELAVL1, EIF4A3, and SRSF1 exhibiting the highest number of interactions. Additionally, molecular docking analysis demonstrated that FUS mutations significantly alter its binding affinity to hsa-circ-0000567 and hsa-circ-0060762. RNA-seq data from ALS patients confirmed significant alterations in the expression of host genes of ALS-related circRNAs and hub proteins across affected tissues, including the spinal cord and multiple brain regions. Collectively, these findings support circRNAs as active contributors to ALS pathogenesis. In particular, the host gene of hsa-circ-0000099, which is expressed in the spinal cord and hippocampus, emerges as a potential biomarker for tissue-specific impairment in ALS. Moreover, its regulatory role in key ALS-related cellular pathways underscores its promise as a candidate for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm its role in ALS pathology.",

      "title": "Convergent and divergent neural and behavioral responses to chronic cocaine use in macaques",
      "content": "Chronic cocaine use leads to physical dependence, psychological addiction, and various health problems such as cardiovascular issues and cognitive impairments. This condition continues to be extremely difficult to treat, as we grapple with its neural and behavioral complexities. What we are missing is a comprehensive account on how naive brains react to occasional and chronic cocaine use, abstinence and re-exposure within subject. We tracked naive macaques using precision functional mapping before, during and after chronic cocaine self-administration over a period of nine months. We analyzed the entire brain to illustrate the pervasive impact of chronic cocaine use on overall function. Although we set out to map the addiction connectome, we found that the neural correlates of chronic drug use and recovery are more complex that can be captured by a singular, canonical connectome. We provide a preclinical model that maps the progression of the macaque functional connectome from a naive state through chronic cocaine use, recovery and re-exposure. We demonstrate that the addiction connectome is dynamic and is characterized by the interaction of subject by drug by time. Occasional cocaine use, whether initial or re-exposure, overrides individual differences, leading to a strong homogenous effect across subjects, or convergence. However, the brain's response to prolonged cocaine use becomes more individualized, resulting in the divergence of effects across subjects. This can be explained by heterogeneity in cocaine-induced effects and in their associated timescales. Abstinence-induced neural alterations converged across subjects after 1-month, but by 2 months, individual trajectories revealed heterogeneity, possibly indicating differences in recovery.",

      "title": "Gain-controlled reconfiguration of long-range coupling explains visibility-dependent spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics",
      "content": "Numerous studies demonstrate the widespread cortical engagement in conscious and unconscious processing (1-5), yet the mechanistic principle that reorganizes spatiotemporal neural dynamics across different levels of conscious access remains unclear. We addressed this using a personalized, connectome-constrained large-scale biophysical model of whole-brain source-imaged electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics recorded from participants who reported the orientation of a backward-masked Gabor patch at four levels of visibility. The key control parameter in the model is the global input gain ({gamma}) to physiologically-grounded cell populations, defined operationally such that higher {gamma} denotes weaker effective global input, which reconfigures long-range couplings and thus modulates spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Fitted {gamma} maps showed higher gain in posterior regions and lower gain in frontal regions on visible trials, whereas the pattern was opposite on invisible trials - i.e., posterior regions received weaker and frontal regions stronger input under visibility, with the opposite under invisibility. This inversion of {gamma} map was observed in pyramidal, VIP, and PV populations, while supplementary pyramidal, SST, and PV time constant were invariant. The visibility-dependent reversal in gain topography mirrored the observed spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics - under visibility, early occipital-to-frontal dynamic coding switched to stable coding, whereas in invisible condition, frontal-dominant stable coding emerged early with attenuated dynamic coding. Simulations generated from the fitted parameters reproduced the observed spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics, supporting a gain-control axis - with pyramidal input efficacy as the principal readout and coordinated VIP/PV modulation - that selects between locally integrating and globally broadcasting regimes as visibility changes. Our results provide a bottom-up mechanistic account of differential perceptual processing depending on the degree of the stimulus awareness, offering insights into potentially resolving ongoing debates about theories of consciousness.",

      "title": "Sources of outdoor air pollution exposure and child brain network development across the United States",
      "content": "Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution is a heterogeneous mixture of chemicals with documented neurotoxic effects. Developmental neuroimaging literature has linked childhood PM2.5 exposure to alterations in brain morphology, microarchitecture, and function, with implications for cognition and psychopathology. However, the extant literature remains largely cross-sectional and often considers PM2.5 a single pollutant, rather than a heterogeneous mixture of chemicals from different sources. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging estimates of exposure to six PM2.5 sources derived from positive matrix factorization, and longitudinal neuroimaging data from a large, geographically-diverse sample of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study youth (N = 6,291) from across the United States (U.S.). To identify exposure-related differences in brain function and assess their geographical generalizability, we used a predictive modeling approach to assess both differences in functional brain network connectivity during childhood (9-11 years of age) and changes in functional brain network connectivity during the transition to adolescence (9-13 years of age) related to PM2.5 exposure. Childhood PM2.5 exposure from traffic emissions and industrial/residual fuel burning were linked to mixed patterns of both stronger and weaker connectivity of sensorimotor networks at ages 9-11 years. Conversely, childhood exposures to secondary pollutants (i.e., ammonium sulfates, nitrates) were linked to largely stronger connectivity of brain networks underlying higher-order cognition that decreased over the following two years. However, these patterns of exposure-related functional connectivity identified in youth across the U.S. better represented youth living in the northeast as compared to youth living in the west. Altogether, this work provides insights into the neurotoxicity of outdoor air pollution exposure in developing sensory and motor systems and potential for biomarkers of eventual psychopathology.",

      "title": "Distributed range adaptation in human parietal encoding of numbers",
      "content": "The brain represents magnitudes through the collective activity of neural populations, whose non-monotonic tuning properties determine the nature and precision of the population neural code. Whether and how this code adapts to changes in the statistics of the encoded magnitudes remains unknown. Here we probe the adaptation of the encoding of numbers in human parietal cortex, using functional MRI during a numerosity-estimation task in which we vary the range of possible numbers. Tracking the tuning properties of number-sensitive populations as the range changes, we show that their receptive fields shift and scale in adaptation to the range, following a structured and predictable pattern. This distributed range adaptation implements efficient coding dynamically: the resulting precision of the neural code varies with the range and is accompanied by corresponding changes in behavioral precision. At the participant level, the degree of neural tuning adaptation significantly correlates with the change in behavioral variability. Our results extend static sensory efficient coding to the adaptive representation of abstract magnitudes, via a neural mechanism of distributed range adaptation that may be a canonical property of neural encoding circuits.",

      "title": "Amorphous silicon resistors enable smaller pixels in photovoltaic retinal prosthesis",
      "content": "Objective. Clinical trials of the photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis PRIMA demonstrated feasibility of prosthetic central vision with resolution matching its 100 \u00b5m pixel width. To improve prosthetic acuity further, pixel size should be decreased. However, there are multiple challenges, one of which is related to accommodating a compact shunt resistor within each pixel that discharges the electrodes between stimulation pulses and helps increase the contrast of the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, standard materials used in integrated circuit resistors do not match the resistivity required for small photovoltaic pixels. Therefore, we used a novel material\u2014doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) and integrated it into photovoltaic arrays with pixel sizes down to 20 \u00b5m. Approach. To fit within a few \u00b5m2 area of the pixels and provide resistance in the M\u03a9 range, the material should have sheet resistance of a few 100 k\u03a9 sq\u22121, which translates to resistivity of a few \u03a9 * cm. The a-Si layer was deposited by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition and its resistivity was adjusted by PH3 doping before encapsulating the resistors between SiO2 and SiC for stability in-vivo. Main results. High-resolution retinal implants with integrated shunt resistors were fabricated with values ranging from 0.75 to 4 M\u03a9 on top of the photovoltaic pixels of 55, 40, 30 and 20 \u00b5m in size. Photoresponsivity with all pixel sizes was approximately 0.53 A W\u22121, as high as in the arrays with no shunt resistor. The shunts shortened electrodes discharge time, with the average electric potential in electrolyte decreasing by only 21%\u201331 % when repetition rate increased from 2 to 30 Hz, as opposed to a 54%\u201355 % decrease without a shunt. Similarly, contrast of a Landolt C pattern increased from 16%\u201322 % with no shunt to 22%\u201334 % with a shunt. Further improvement in contrast is expected with pillar electrodes and local returns within each pixel. Significance. Miniature shunt resistors in a M\u03a9 range can be fabricated from doped a-Si in a process compatible with manufacturing of photovoltaic arrays. The shunt resistors improved current injection and spatial contrast at video frame rates, without compromising the photoresponsivity. These advances are critical for scaling pixel sizes below 100\u202f\u00b5m to improve visual acuity of prosthetic vision.",

      "content": "The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for learning and decision making, but its organization in terms of anatomical connections to other brain areas is not well understood in humans. Here we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography to characterize the cortical and subcortical white matter connections of the human OFC. We found widespread connectivity of the OFC with frontal and temporal cortices, anterior cingulate, insula, olfactory cortex, as well as the striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamic nuclei. We then used k-means clustering to parcellate the OFC into different subregions based on these connections, revealing a medial\u2013lateral division with two clusters, and a separation into medial, lateral-anterior, and lateral-posterior subdivisions with three clusters. Higher order parcellations revealed more complex subdivisions mirroring cytoarchitectural boundaries of the primate OFC. Analysis of the white matter connectivity of the medial and lateral OFC clusters revealed differences in their connectivity patterns with frontal cortices, insula, olfactory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the striatum and several thalamic nuclei. In addition, lateral-anterior and lateral-posterior OFC clusters showed different connectivity strengths with several frontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and the caudate. These findings suggest parallels between the anatomical organization of the human and macaque OFC and may help to elucidate how the OFC contributes to adaptive behavior.
