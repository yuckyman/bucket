      "title": "Neural markers of visual working memory during an upper extremity movement-coupled task: a mobile brain-body imaging (MOBI) study.",
      "content": "Optimal goal directed behavior in everyday life involves the appropriate coupling of cognition and movement. In this study we employed a mobile brain-body imaging (MoBI) system that integrated time-synchronized high-density electroencephalography with three-dimensional motion capture during a touchscreen visual working memory task requiring dynamic upper extremity reach responses. Using this framework we examined how increasing memory load (e.g. from 1-disc to 4-discs) influences behavior and scalp-recorded neural activity when cognitive and motor processes are coupled within a single task, and whether these effects are modulated by handedness. Increasing memory load reliably degraded working memory task performance and slowed motor preparation while core movement execution measures remained largely preserved. Regarding electroencephalography data, parieto-occipital activity increased with load during both the early visual-evoked N1 and the delay period However, load-related modulation reached a plateau at the 3-disc condition during the delay period only. Posterior-frontal engagement also strengthened as load increased, consistent with demands on attentional control memory maintenance and sensorimotor planning. Brain-behavior associations were most robust at a moderate 2-disc level where contralateral delay activity correlated with both cognitive and motor performance measures. Finally, although handedness exerted selective behavioral effects it did not modulate load-related parieto-occipital neural activity Together these findings demonstrate that a multimodal MoBI approach captures integrated cognitive-motor dynamics during working memory guided actions, providing a more comprehensive characterization of behavior and underlying neural signatures than either modality alone This framework offers a translational approach for studying cognitive-motor interactions and their potential disruption in neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease.",

      "content": "<p>I thought it would be interesting to have ID style hover docs outside the IDE.<p>Hover is a Chrome extension that gives you IDE style hover tooltips on any webpage: documentation sites, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.<p>How it works:\n- When a code block comes into view, the extension detects tokens and sends the code to an LLM (via OpenRouter or custom endpoint)\n- The LLM generates documentation for tokens worth documenting, which gets cached\n- On hover, the cached documentation is displayed instantly<p>A few things I wanted to get right:\n- Website permissions are granular and use Chrome's permission system, so the extension only runs where you allow it\n- Custom endpoints let you skip OpenRouter entirely \u2013 if you're at a company with its own infra, you can point it at AWS Bedrock, Google AI Studio, or whatever you have<p>Built with TypeScript, Vite, and the Chrome extension APIs. Coming to the Chrome Web Store soon.<p>Would love feedback on the onboarding experience and general UX \u2013 there were a lot of design decisions I wasn't sure about.<p>Happy to answer questions about the implementation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46490895\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46490895</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
