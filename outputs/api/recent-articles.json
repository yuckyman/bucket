      "title": "A Pilot Study on Fabric-Based Pneumatic Soft Gloves for Assisting Patients With Severe Brachial Plexus Injury",
      "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

      "content": "The open-source development model has been successfully applied to consumer and enterprise software, and recently to consumer hardware. Medical devices may become a beneficiary of this trend, as open-source medical device development has the potential to reduce costs, democratize patient access, and provide continued support to abandoned devices from failed companies. Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology. This review of open-source medical device development explores the current state of development in research and clinical products and suggests best practices for creating sustainable and effective open-source medical devices.",

      "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
      "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "title": "Lower engagement of cognitive control, attention, modulation networks and lower creativity in children while using ChatGPT: an fMRI study",
      "content": "Generative AI can scaffold idea generation, but how it engages control, attention, and memory systems in the developing versus mature brain, and how this relates to creativity, remains unclear. We compared 6-7-year-old (N = 15) children and adults (N = 16) during a naturalistic 5-minute co-creative dialogue with ChatGPT using the same prompt, in-scanner conversation, undergoing functional MRI scanning and their dialogues were recorded. Functional connectivity (Fisher's z) was computed within and between seven large-scale networks: cingulo-opercular, default mode (DMN), memory retrieval, frontoparietal (FP), salience, ventral attention (VAN), and dorsal attention (DAN). Creativity scores, assessed outside of the scanner, did not differ between groups. Adults showed stronger within-network connectivity in control/attention systems, most robustly in FP, with additional effects in salience and DAN. Adults also exhibited greater cross-network integration, particularly FP-salience and FP-DAN couplings, alongside broader adult-greater effects among memory- and attention-related pairs. During a co-creative AI-assisted conversation, children exhibit a less coherent and integrated control-attention-memory architecture than adults. The combination of similar creativity scores with divergent neural profiles suggests that developmental differences in the implementation of creative cognition may be more pronounced than baseline capacity. Our findings highlight FP-centric pathways and their salience-gated interactions as candidate substrates by which creativity supports goal-directed co-creative dialogue with AI.",

      "content": "Hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line have proven to be a good model for studying hair cell function in a system that is easily genetically manipulated, rapidly develops and is experimentally accessible. However, characterization of potential developmental changes, and possible differences along lateral line position are lacking. Here, we used in vivo patch clamp to investigate the electrophysiological and exocytic properties of neuromast hair cells over early development across body location. Long depolarizations led to steady increases in membrane capacitance, presumably due to exocytosis of vesicles localized to ribbon synapses. The magnitude and kinetics of capacitance changes did not vary significantly across the L1 to L6 position of neuromasts along lateral line, but the magnitudes were found to be significantly smaller in hair cells found in the tail region across all developmental time points. For each region, we found no significant changes in capacitance responses between 3 and 7 days after fertilization. Hair cell capacitance responses were greatly reduced in animals injected with CRISPR/Cas9 with gRNAs targeted to otoferlin b. These results confirm the essential role of otoferlin b in neuromast hair cell function, and they establish the fidelity of CRISPR/Cas9 to rapidly mediate genetic removal of critical genes to study their impact on synaptic release.",

      "content": "Klotho (Kl) is an anti-aging protein primarily produced in the kidney and the choroid plexus (CP, where it regulates cerebrospinal fluid composition and exerts neuroprotective effects. Here, we investigated the age-dependent consequences of a CP-specific Kl deletion on CP structure and function using mice lacking KL exclusively in CP epithelial cells (Kl{Delta}CP). In control mice, aging markedly disrupted CP architecture and cilia organization both in the lateral (LV-CP) and fourth ventricle (FV-CP). While CP-specific Kl deletion alone caused no major structural changes it induced region- and age-dependent calcification: FV-CP calcification increased in both aged and young Kl{Delta}CP mice, whereas LV-CP calcification emerged only in older Kl{Delta}CP mice. Proteomic analysis of the CP and hippocampus revealed mild molecular alterations, suggesting compensatory mechanisms that preserve structural and functional stability despite calcium dysregulation. Consistently, Kl{Delta}CP mice exhibited no significant behavioral or cognitive deficits. Overall, Kl deficiency sensitizes the CP to age-related calcification prior to overt structural decline, revealing a region-specific and functional link between Klotho, calcium imbalance, and brain aging.",

      "content": "Globally, stress levels among women of reproductive age are rising, while fertility rates continue to decline. Despite this correlation, a causal link between stress and reduced fertility remains unclear. Experimental studies have shown that severe and chronic stress can disrupt reproductive function, but the effects of mild stress, more representative of the daily stress experienced by most women, are still poorly understood. This study aims to identify how mild stress affects the mouse estrous cycle. Nineteen mice were vaginally lavaged daily one week before stress, during 3-day stress, and one week after stress. The mild stress paradigm consisted of two hours of repeated restraint stress each day for three days. Restraint stress disrupted the estrous cycle causing a longer cycle length in stressed mice, characterized by an extended duration in the diestrus phase. These findings suggest that even moderate stress perturbs normal reproductive cycling, potentially contributing to reduced fertility. This work highlights the need to further explore how everyday stressors may subtly impair reproductive health.",

      "content": "Treatment options for Disorders of Consciousness (DoC) are limited due to insufficient understanding of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Two primary strategies for characterizing DoC and assessing treatment efficacy are in vivo experiments with animal models, and in silico computational models. We combined both approaches by creating a whole-brain model tailored to the experimental functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of a single anesthetized macaque. It was previously reported in an in vivo experiment that anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness was partially reversed by specific electrical stimulation of the thalamic central nuclei. The in silico model reproduced the brain dynamics underlying the restoration of consciousness, providing a potential explanation for the transition between these brain states as continuous trajectories unfolding in a low-dimensional space. Our results demonstrate that whole-brain computational models reproduce the spatiotemporal properties of fMRI recordings during loss of consciousness and during its recovery induced by electrical stimulation, enabling computational exploration of perturbation-based interventions to potentially personalize treatment and aid recovery of consciousness in DoC patients.",

      "title": "Inhibitory Motifs Quench Synchrony Induced by Excitatory Motifs in Biological Neuronal Networks",
      "content": "The connectivity in biological neuronal networks is known to deviate significantly from the random network (Erdos-Renyi) model. Specifically, di-synaptic motifs like reciprocal, convergent, divergent, and chain are found to be either over-represented or under-represented in certain brain regions. Over-representation of such motifs among excitatory neurons is known to induce synchrony. However, cortical activity is typically asynchronous. Thus, it remains unclear how synchrony induced by excitatory motifs may be reduced to physiological levels. To address this question, we systematically vary the prevalence of these four motifs in an Excitatory-Inhibitory (EI) network. We found that over-representation of chain and convergent motifs in the excitatory population led to increased firing rates and greater synchrony. However, this excess synchrony was quenched when we introduced the same type of motifs among inhibitory neurons. Because of the overabundance of motifs, some inhibitory neurons received fewer recurrent inhibitory inputs. Such weakly coupled neurons were primarily driven by uncorrelated external inputs, and therefore, these neurons exerted stronger inhibition on excitatory neurons and reduced both synchrony and firing rates. Thus, we also provide a new mechanism by which synchrony can be controlled in excitatory-inhibitory networks. We predict that the same kind of di-synaptic motifs should be present in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.",

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
