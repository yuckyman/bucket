      "title": "Learning induces persistent chromatin loops underlying robust gene expression during memory recall",
      "content": "Long-term memories are stored in neuronal ensembles called engrams, but the existence of persistent molecular traces in nuclei of engram neurons remain unknown. Using activity-dependent nuclear tagging in vivo, we profiled higher-order chromatin folding and DNA methylation in thousands of single hippocampal neurons up to a month after contextual fear conditioning (CFC). We find CFC-induced chromatin loop plasticity genome-wide, including persistently gained and lost loops with enduring traces in vivo. DNA methylation showed minimal CFC-induced persistence at promoters and enhancers. Persistently gained and lost loops connect distinct enhancers and promoters in excitatory and inhibitory subtypes and correlate with robust CFC-upregulated and -downregulated gene expression, respectively, upon recall. Synaptic genes associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and autism anchor neuronal subtype-specific persistent loops, suggesting relevance to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. We harness the power and sensitivity of multi-modal single-cell measurements to find enduring chromatin traces linked to robust gene expression during fear memory recall.",

      "title": "Integrative multiomic analysis links TDP-43-driven splicing defects to cascading proteomic disruption of ALS/FTD pathways",
      "content": "Loss of nuclear TDP-43 is a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although TDP-43 is known to regulate RNA processing, including repression of cryptic exons, we currently lack a systems-level understanding of the consequences of TDP-43 loss. To address this, we generated multiomic datasets, including RNA-seq and proteomics, from human iPSC-derived neurons depleted of TDP-43. We found that differentially spliced genes, many expressing cryptic exons, had the greatest protein reductions. Surprisingly, nearly half of differentially expressed proteins were neither mis-spliced, nor differentially expressed genes; most of these also had no reported mis-splicing in seven additional post-mortem and iPSC-derived neuron datasets. Integrative network analysis identified a high-confidence disease-specific subnetwork of over 700 interacting proteins, enriched for mRNA processing, synaptic function, and autophagy. Comparison with post-mortem ALS and FTD samples revealed convergent protein and pathway disruptions. We experimentally validated network-predicted effects of cryptic splicing in ATG4B, STMN2, and DAPK1. Our analyses reveal new TDP-43-dependent molecular cascades and nominate central genes as potential ALS/FTD therapeutic targets.",

      "content": "Keratoconus (KCN) is an uncommon corneal disorder where the central cornea undergoes advanced thinning and causes non-uniform astigmatism. This results in metamorphopsia and potential vision loss if it is left untreated. Early detection of KCN is major to provide timely intervention and address severe visual impairment. But, conventional diagnostic tools corneal topography and slit-lamp examinations are based on expert interpretation; they are subjective and insufficient to find early KCN. To...",

      "content": "With the development of advanced imaging technologies, the demand for high quality images in various fields has increased. However, image degradation due to noise, data loss, and other factors persistently hinder image quality. Image restoration (IR) is a critical task in computer vision, aiming to recover original images from degraded observations. Traditional non-learning prior based methods offer flexibility and interpretability but often yield sub-optimal results due to limited...",

We report a 40-year-old man presenting with progressive headache, blurred vision, and elevated intracranial pressure. Magnetic resonance venography confirmed CVST. Thrombophilia screening identified heterozygous methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 4G/5G promoter polymorphism. These gene polymorphisms have been consistently...",
