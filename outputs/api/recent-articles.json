      "title": "Adolescent Social Isolation Facilitates Tau Spread in Raphe Nuclei Linking Depression and Hyperalgesia in Alzheimers Disease",
      "content": "Tau pathology in brainstem serotonergic circuits drives early neuropsychiatric dysfunction in Alzheimers disease (AD), yet mechanisms linking the exposome, particularly social stress exposures to depression and altered pain perception, remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that adolescent social isolation, a critical psychosocial exposome factor and major trigger of depression, facilitates tau propagation in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and downstream raphe nuclei, producing both neuropsychiatric and pain-related sequelae. Tau[P301L] was transduced into the DRN of 30-day socially isolated or group housed C57BL/6J mice using AAV, with control mice receiving AAV-GFP. Four weeks post-transduction, anxiety, social behavior, and pain sensitivity were assessed, and phosphorylated tau (ptau) within the DRN and spread to the median raphe (MRN) and raphe magnus (RMg) serotonergic neurons were evaluated. Socially isolated tau[P301L] mice exhibited hyperlocomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social deficits and hyperalgesia. Histological analysis revealed elevated ptau within TPH2 neurons in the DRN and trans-synaptic tau spread to MRN and RMg, accompanied by reduced TPH2 and increased ptau at the downstream raphe nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed altered expression of Slc6a4 and Tgm2, a stress-responsive gene implicated in AD. These results indicate that DRN tau under social stress drives neuropsychiatric phenotypes, while tau spread to MRN and RMg disrupts serotonergic modulation of pain. This study provides the first evidence that adolescent stress promotes tau propagation within the raphe nuclei, linking early neuropsychiatric and pain-processing deficits to prodromal Alzheimers disease and identifying a critical pathway through which psychosocial exposome risk converges with tau pathology to enable early intervention.",

      "content": "Synaptic dysfunction has been proposed as cellular pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia, yet the brain-wide distribution of dysfunctional circuits at single-neuron resolution has remained unknown. Here, we perform comprehensive multi-probe electrophysiological investigations in vivo in the Grin2a+/- preclinical model for schizophrenia and control animals, recording across ~45 brain regions spanning cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus. Mutants displayed distributed and graded alterations across regions, with prominent activity reductions in higher-order thalamus and cross-parameter alterations across prefrontal cortices, striatum, and hippocampus. Restoration of higher-order thalamic activity in mutants was sufficient to normalize alterations in connected prefrontal cortices and striatum and unexpectedly cascaded distally to hippocampus and sensory cortices. Thus, higher-order thalamus plays a pivotal role in schizophrenia pathophysiology and restoration of a single informed locus could present a potent therapeutic strategy.",

      "title": "Mechanism-Specific Speech Encoding Failures in Auditory Neuropathy: A Computational Phenotyping Framework",
      "content": "Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) causes severe speech comprehension deficits despite preserved cochlear function. Patients vary widely in their impairments, likely reflecting distinct pathophysiological mechanisms that current diagnostics cannot distinguish. A fundamental barrier to diagnosis is that standard speech tests take a one-size-fits-all approach - yielding aggregate intelligibility scores that average across phoneme categories, obscuring mechanism-specific patterns. We hypothesized that different ANSD mechanisms produce distinct phoneme-specific signatures that targeted testing could reveal. Using computational modeling of auditory nerve responses, we tested four mechanism types through three sequential experiments demonstrating that mechanism-specific encoding disruptions cascade into speech recognition failures that remain robust under noise. Brief consonants (flaps, stops) showed severe disruption while sustained vowels were relatively preserved - and critically, these category-specific patterns differed across mechanisms. Speech recognition models trained on ANSD-degraded neural representations developed compensation strategies that generalize to healthy signals, while the reverse failed completely, establishing a fundamental asymmetry: spectral compensation generalizes while temporal integration requires intact timing. These patterns persist under noise, where the same training that benefits healthy listeners harms ANSD listeners, explaining why ANSD patients struggle disproportionately in real-world listening conditions. The results suggest that phoneme-targeted testing - examining specific categories rather than using phonetically balanced materials - may enable mechanism-specific diagnosis and personalized intervention.",

      "title": "Patients with chronic ankle instability exhibit increased sensorimotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and superior temporal gyrus activation during single-leg stance: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study",
      "content": "IntroductionBalance deficits are associated with clinical manifestations in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI); however, evidence of cortical plasticity related to balance control remains insufficient. This study aimed to evaluate cortical activity and balance differences between patients with CAI and healthy individuals during single-leg stance, with or without vision, and to explore the correlations between brain blood flow signals and homeostatic function to elucidate the neurophysiological changes in balance control.MethodsThis cohort study involved 30 patients with CAI from a single hospital and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Cortical activity in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The activity ranges of the center of mass (COM), acceleration, and acceleration extremes were calculated using wearable inertial sensors. Moreover, scale assessments (visual analog scale, foot and ankle ability measure, and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool) and functional tests (classical balance, Y-balance, multi-directional reach tests, and timed up-and-go tests) were conducted.ResultsSignificant between-group effects were observed for the root mean square (RMS) centroid acceleration in the anteroposterior (AP) direction (F = 5.51, p = 0.02), whereas within- and between-group differences existed for RMS centroid acceleration in the mediolateral (ML) direction (F = 3.56, p = 0.03; F = 8.5, p = 0.004). Significant within- and between-group differences were identified for peak acceleration magnitude (Acc_max) \u2013AP (F = 7.85, p = 0.001; F = 11.83, p = 0.001) and Acc_max\u2013ML (F = 15.64, p = 0.0001; F = 5.06, p = 0.026). The oxyhemoglobin concentration change (\u0394HbO2) was significantly greater in patients with CAI than in healthy controls during single-leg stance; between-group differences were identified in the STG\u2013right cerebral hemisphere (R) (F = 10.25, p = 0.002), DLPFC\u2013R (F = 50.99, p = 0.001), SMC\u2013R (F = 27.48, p = 0.0001), STG\u2013left cerebral hemisphere (L) (F = 13.6, p = 0.0001), DLPFC\u2013L (F = 24.21, p = 0.0001), and SMC\u2013L (F = 29.75, p = 0.0001); within-group differences in the SMC\u2013L (F = 9.92, p = 0.0001); and interaction effects in the STG\u2013R (F = 5.73, p = 0.004). During right-leg stance with the eyes closed, RMS\u2013ML and Acc_max\u2013ML exhibited a high positive correlation with \u0394HbO2 in the STG\u2013L (RMS\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.72; Acc_max\u2013ML: p = 0.001, r = 0.74).ConclusionPatients with CAI exhibited lower balance ability and greater COM bias than healthy controls, with increased bilateral activation in brain regions, regardless of which limb was elevated; the results were more pronounced with vision inhibited. Enhanced brain activity was positively correlated with COM changes. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy and wearable inertial sensors can detect balance in patients with CAI.",

      "title": "Association between cortical auditory evoked potentials recorded directly through cochlear implants and post-implantation auditory and speech outcomes",
      "content": "IntroductionFollowing the demonstration of feasibility in recording electrically evoked cortical auditory evoked potentials (eCAEPs) directly via cochlear implants in both children and adults, the present(CIs), this study aimed to investigate the relationship between eCAEP waveform characteristics and auditory and speech performance among cochlear implant (CI) users. Additionally, the effects of age at implantation and current age on the latencies and amplitudes of the P1, N1, and P2 complex were evaluated, within the framework of developmental auditory cortical plasticity.MethodsThe study included 25 children (mean age 11.5 \u00b1 4 years) and 12 adults; (mean age 33.8 \u00b1 12.3 years), all bilaterally implanted with Advanced Bionics devices. Intracochlear eCAEPs were recorded from 33 implanted ears in children and 21 ears in adults. Recordings were obtained via the contralateral basal electrode (number 13) in response to brief (10 ms) electrical stimulation of the apical electrode of the stimulated CI while recordings were done via basal electrode number 13 of the contralateral recording CI referenced to the CI case. Each recording session lasted approximately 5 minutes. Children ranged in age from 2.7 to 16.7 years (mean: 11.5 \u00b1 4), and adults from 18.5 to 49.1 years (mean: 33.8 \u00b1 12.3). Age at implantation ranged from 0.5 to 8.1 years in children (mean: averaged 1.75 \u00b1 1.4), and from 1.6 to 43.6 years in adults (mean: for children and 23.5 \u00b1 16.6) years for adults. Speech and auditory performance were assessed using CAP, SIR, and monosyllabic word recognition in quiet and noise.ResultsReliable eCAEPs with all obligatory components were recorded in all ears. Children demonstrated significantly shorter P1-N1 latencies and larger amplitudes compared to the adult cohort in this study. Age at implantation was the strongest predictor of cortical latency, with earlier implantation correlating with shorter P1-N1 latencies. Most children exhibited age-appropriate P1 latencies comparable to normal-hearing peers, whereas only a few adults-those implanted in early childhood-showed similar patterns. In addition, adult responses frequently showed displayed a split P2 waveform, less prominent in children, possibly reflecting altered cortical integration. Notably, significant correlations were found between eCAEP latencies and speech perception scores, particularly in noise, suggesting functional relevance of cortical processing efficiency. Participants with higher CAP and SIR scores exhibited significantly shorter P1-N1 latencies.DiscussionThese findings provide near-field neurophysiological evidence supporting the critical role of sensitive periods in auditory cortical development. The results underscore the value of intracochlear eCAEPs as a neuroscience-based, objective biomarker of auditory cortical function and plasticity in CI users. This approach enables real-time monitoring of neuroplastic changes and offers a novel platform for translational auditory neuroscience in both pediatric and adult implant recipients.",

      "title": "Autonomic neurotransmission in cardiovascular regulation and pathophysiology",
      "content": "The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is a central regulator of cardiovascular function, coordinating involuntary control of heart rate, vascular tone, and blood pressure through its sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) subdivisions. The SNS mediates the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response via catecholamines, increasing heart rate, contractility, and vasoconstriction, whereas the PNS promotes restorative processes through acetylcholine, decreasing heart rate and enhancing vasodilation. Nitric oxide further modulates vascular tone and autonomic balance, serving as a key neuromodulator. Assessment of cardiovascular autonomic function relies on heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and other physiological tests, which provide insight into the dynamic interplay between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Dysregulation of the ANS contributes to cardiovascular pathologies, including cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, hypertension, and heart failure, where sympathetic overactivity and impaired parasympathetic modulation exacerbate disease progression. Pharmacologic interventions, such as \u03b2-blockers and ivabradine, alongside non-pharmacologic approaches, including structured exercise and respiratory training, aim to restore autonomic balance and improve clinical outcomes. Understanding the exact mechanisms of autonomic neurotransmission is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and optimizing cardiovascular care. Future research integrating molecular, genetic, and systems-level analyses will further elucidate autonomic regulation, guiding personalized interventions to mitigate cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

If it happened today, where would the fallout plumes go and where would you drive to get out of it. NukeCast uses weather forecasts to drive a Lagrangian particle dispersion model with wet and dry deposition. Scenarios are defined by selecting strike site(s) and yield(s); the setup uses preselected US sites and yields based on FEMA emergency data. Outputs are shown as estimated ground level radiation dose at the surface over a 12 hour integration. Free to use with limits, and a paid tier if you want more runs/features because AWS compute time ain\u2019t cheap.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46761493\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46761493</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",
