A local TUI (like Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode or Copilot) that wraps your agent and sends each turn to an email in a nice format.<p>What does it enable? It lets you email your agents. And them email you. So They Keep Working on the tasks you want, and You go and do What You Want. No need to stay at your desk. Be free.<p>I built this for me, but thought others would find it useful, so I turned it into a product. I want get outside, and away from my desk, but still have the agents work.<p>The accidental killer feature: You can CC your team. If you forward the thread to a coworker, their reply goes straight to the agent context too. It turns a local session into an async multiplayer thread.<p>Works out of the box with Claude, Codex, Gemini, Copilot, and OpenCode.

      "title": "Repetition Coherence Reveals Computational Principles of Auditory Object Formation",
      "content": "Repetition is a powerful cue for auditory object formation. In natural environments, however, repetitions are rarely exact copies of sound sequences and often overlap with competing sounds. To characterise the temporal integration dynamics and the evidence required for perceptual organisation of acoustic scenes into objects, we developed a repetition-coherence framework inspired by motion-coherence paradigms in vision. Participants listened to dense tone-cloud sequences in which a subset of tones repeated across cycles, with the proportion of repeating tones indicating coherence. Across two psychophysical tasks (repetition detection and sensorimotor synchronization), repetition coherence had strikingly similar effects: it shaped both the likelihood of object formation and the consistency of subsequent tracking. At high coherence, the emergence of the object and the attainment of a stable tracking phase occurred at the same number of cycles. The behavioural trajectory of synchronization performance, used to infer the dynamics of temporal integration, parallels prior neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, establishing a link between perception and neurophysiology. Moreover, we observed threshold shifts due to unit duration in the detection task, which indicates a dissociation between the effect of temporal scale on the likelihood and timing of object emergence: longer units when repeated reduced detection probability, but emergence timing remained constant. These findings demonstrate convergent behavioural dynamics shaped by bottom-up regularities, while intrinsic temporal integration windows constrain the process differently according to task demands. Overall, repetition coherence provides a principled framework for probing the processes underpinning auditory object formation, revealing common behavioural signatures alongside distinct sensitivities to temporal scale.",

      "title": "Attention and body awareness: The role of inhibition and the management of cognitive resources in the perception of spontaneous sensations.",
      "content": "When the body is attended to and viewed, it appears that only a subset of bodily sensations enters awareness. Some of these sensations can be felt on the skin even though no stimulation triggers their perception: They are commonly referred to as spontaneous sensations (SPS). It is hypothesized that inhibition and the management of cognitive resources are involved in their perception through phenomena of amplification and suppression. However, the involvement of these processes in body awareness remains poorly understood. We investigated the relationship between attentional abilities and the perception of SPS in order to provide the further information regarding this matter. A dual-task paradigm involving visual search and auditory detection was used to assess attentional abilities prior to the investigation of SPS perceived when attending to the glabrous and visible surface of the hand. We found that difficulties in inhibiting distractors were associated with a lower perception of SPS, while difficulties in managing cognitive resources were associated with an increase in the frequency of SPS and a decrease in the perception of paresis-like SPS. This suggests that these attentional processes are involved separately in body awareness and allows us to discuss how attention contributes to the conscious awareness of the body.
