      "title": "HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface With Hierarchical Force Control",
      "content": "Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.",

      "title": "\u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d: Studying the Influence of Vibration Parameters on Speech Persuasion",
      "content": "This paper investigates the notion of \u201cPersuasive Vibrations\u201d, which showed that augmenting a person's speech with vibrotactile feedback could artificially increase persuasion. However, while the initial paper has shown the effect, the underlying reasons why vibrations enhance persuasion remain unknown. Through two different user studies, this paper aims to study how the underlying parameters of the vibratory feedback (e.g., frequency, amplitude, or audio-vibration synchronization) influence persuasion. The first study aimed to identify the parameters of vibrotactile feedback that can positively influence persuasion. The second study evaluated vibrotactile feedback that might impair the persuasive effect. In a nutshell, the first experiment suggests that the isolation of different properties of the vibratory signal could tend to provide higher persuasion compared to no vibratory feedback. A lower frequency at 100 Hz seems the most efficient way to generate a persuasive effect. In contrast, the second experiment suggests that some alteration of the vibratory signal (e.g., latency) does not decrease the levels of persuasion compared to the no-vibration condition. All in all, the results suggest that using lower frequencies could have a better effect on persuasion. These results could serve as a basis for haptic design in applications like videoconferencing, virtual meetings, and training systems where supporting user speech is essential.",

      "content": "While vibrotactile displays continue to gain popularity, it remains that the phenomenon of tactile change blindness negatively impacts the human ability to detect changes between and within tactile signals. This paper surveys the research literature on tactile change detection and blindness under various parameters, including the number of tactors used, the intensity and length of the stimulus, and whether distractors between stimuli (i.e., transients) were used during experimentation, among others. The goal of this survey is to summarize what has been done in an attempt to better understand the parameters that exacerbate tactile change blindness and identify potential areas of future research. When such an understanding is reached, the design of haptic and multimodal displays may ideally be improved.",

      "title": "From Restoration to Augmentation: New Approaches to Haptic Feedback for Artificial Limbs",
      "content": "Haptic feedback is essential for precise motor control, making its integration into artificial limbs a critical design challenge. Current approaches to restoring lost tactile input in patients have focused on interfacing with somatosensory pathways at the brain, nerve, or skin level, achieving partial restoration. However, augmentative artificial limbs, devices that provide novel movement capabilities beyond the biological body, pose unique challenges. These limbs lack dedicated sensory pathways, raising fundamental questions about how to deliver tactile feedback for these devices without disrupting existing somatosensory function. A promising direction lies in exploiting intrinsic tactile feedback, which emerges naturally at the interface between wearable devices and the body. When an artificial limb moves or interacts with objects, the skin detects rich tactile cues transmitted through this interface. Amplifying and refining this intrinsic feedback, via materials optimized for transmission of tactile signals and wearable designs, could enable more intuitive and interpretable haptic feedback for augmentative limbs. This approach offers a pathway toward enhancing embodiment and motor control of augmentative artificial limbs.",

      "title": "Typical Perceptual Sensitivity to Changes in Interpersonal Distance in Developmental Prosopagnosia",
      "content": "Social perception research has traditionally sought to elucidate the visual processing engaged by the faces and bodies of individuals. Recently, however, there has been growing interest in how we perceive dyadic interactions between people. Early findings suggest that dyads arranged face-to-face may engage neurocognitive processing similar to that recruited by faces. Given these parallels, we sought to determine whether individuals with developmental prosopagnosa (DP), who exhibit lifelong face recognition difficulties, also exhibit impaired perception of facing dyads. The focus of our investigation was interpersonal distance\u2014a key visual feature of dyadic social interactions. Participants completed three distance change detection tasks. Two of the tasks depicted distance changes during dyadic social interactions (fighting and dancing). A third task depicted distance changes using nonsocial objects (a pair of grandfather clocks). If DP is associated with impoverished perception of dyadic interactions, we reasoned that individuals with DP should exhibit diminished sensitivity to distance changes on the dancers task and the boxers task, but not on the clocks task. Contrary to this prediction, however, individuals with DP and typical controls did not differ significantly in their ability to detect distance changes on any of the tasks. Although the visual processing of faces and facing dyads exhibit certain similarities, these findings suggest that the underlying perceptual mechanisms may dissociate.",

      "title": "The Interactive Effects of Negative Emotion and Reward Motivation on Visual Perception",
      "content": "Although there is a rapidly growing interest in reward\u2013emotion interactions, our current understanding of how negative emotion influences reward motivation and modulates reward-driven enhancements in visual perception remains limited. To address these gaps, we conducted an fMRI study using a novel variant of the monetary incentive delay task where the valence (negative or neutral) of an emotional scene image served as a cue to indicate a reward or no-reward prospect in the subsequent house\u2013building discrimination task. During the initial cue stage, we hypothesized competitive interactions between reward anticipation and negative emotion along the common value/valence dimension. However, we instead found independent neural signatures of reward (vs. no-reward) anticipation in the ventral striatum and negative (vs. neutral) emotion in the ventromedial pFC and amygdala, with a lack of evidence for their interaction. Notably, during the subsequent task stage, we detected an Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), wherein reward-driven enhancements in task-related processing were attenuated in the case of negative (vs. neutral) cue images. Furthermore, the Emotion \u00d7 Reward interaction scores in PHG and behavioral RTs were correlated across participants. Finally, a regression analysis revealed that negative valence-related activity in ventromedial pFC moderated the relationship between ventral striatum reward anticipation activity and PHG task-related processing. These findings demonstrate that negative emotion and reward motivation, which were largely segregated during the cue stage, interactively modulated subsequent visual perception, thus potentially influencing behavior.",

      "content": "Crowding is a phenomenon in which visual object identification is impaired by the close proximity of other stimuli. The neural processes leading to object recognition and its breakdown as seen in crowding are still debated. To assess how crowding affects the processing of stimuli in visual cortex, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by flickering target and flanker stimuli while manipulating the spacing of these stimuli (Experiment 1) as well as target similarity (Experiment 2). Participants who performed an orientation discrimination task while proportion correct, along with frequency-tagged SSVEPs elicited by target and flanker stimuli, were recorded. Decreasing target\u2013flanker distance reduced both behavioral performance and target-elicited SSVEP amplitudes. Estimates of the critical spacing, a measure of the spatial extent of crowding, from both behavioral data and SSVEP amplitudes were similar. In addition, manipulating target similarity affected both measures in the same way. These findings establish a clear connection between the suppression of stimulus processing by nearby flankers in visual cortex and crowding, and demonstrate the usefulness of SSVEPs in studying the cortical mechanisms of visual crowding.",
