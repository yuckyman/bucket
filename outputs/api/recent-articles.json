      "title": "The fecal microbiota transplantation from drug-naive schizophrenia patients distinctively changes gut microbiome and metabolic profiles in male and female mice",
      "content": "Background: Emerging evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in schizophrenia (SCZ) and antipsychotic-induced metabolic perturbations. Using human fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in mice, this study investigated the role of gut microbiome in metabolic changes related to SCZ and antipsychotic (olanzapine) treatment. Methods: 5-6 weeks old germ-free NIH Swiss mice of both sexes received microbiota from either SCZ patients (SCZ-FMT) or healthy controls (HC-FMT) followed by a diet with or without olanzapine for six-weeks. Food intake and body weight were monitored weekly, and an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and open field test were performed. Serum glucose, and insulin were measured. Gut microbiome characterization and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) quantification were performed in the cecal samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Results: Olanzapine treatment decreased the locomotor activity in the open field test, irrespective of sex or microbiota. Female SCZ-FMT recipient mice exhibited insulin resistance compared to HC-FMT, irrespective of olanzapine treatment. Female SCZ-FMT mice showed significantly lower alpha-diversity compared to HC-FMT, whereas olanzapine treatment increased alpha-diversity. SCZ-FMT and olanzapine treatment differentially altered the microbial abundances and metabolic pathways in male and female mice. Interestingly, cecal SCFAs, mainly acetate levels, were significantly decreased in female SCZ-FMT mice compared to HC-FMT, while olanzapine treatment increased acetate levels in male mice. Both male and female SCZ-FMT mice showed elevated levels of isovaleric acid compared to HC-FMT. Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that the gut microbiome could be a predisposing factor contributing to the intrinsic risk of developing type 2 diabetes associated with SCZ in females.",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "title": "Frequency-selective contrast sensitivity modulation driven by fine-tuned exogenous attention at the foveal scale",
      "content": "Exogenous attention is a rapid, involuntary mechanism that automatically reallocates processing resources toward salient stimuli. It enhances visual sensitivity in the vicinity of the salient stimulus, both in extrafoveal regions and within the high-acuity foveola. While the spatial frequencies modulated by exogenous attention in extrafoveal vision are well characterized, it remains unknown how this mechanism operates within the foveola, which can resolve spatial frequencies up to 30 cycles per...",
