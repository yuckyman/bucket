      "title": "Superior Colliculus Projections Drive Dopamine Neuron Activity and Movement But Not Value",
      "content": "<p>To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into DA pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for DA neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomy and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in male and female rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite DA and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto DA neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with DA neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.</p>",

      "title": "Launch HN: Karumi (YC F25) \u2013 Personalized, agentic product demos",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Toni and Pablo, and we're building Karumi (<a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai\">https://www.karumi.ai</a>), a system that lets your users get instant, scalable, guided demos of your product, fully automated, zero human interaction. It works in any language.<p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a>. There's also a live demo at  <a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz\">https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz</a>.<p>Karumi is an AI agent that operates a real web app in a shared browser session and talks the user through it. Instead of a human giving a screen-share demo, the agent opens your product, clicks around, fills forms, and explains what it\u2019s doing. We started building this as an internal tool at our previous company. As the product grew, people kept asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the right way to demo feature X?\u201c. Docs and scripts became outdated quickly, and the quality of demos depended too much on who was presenting. We wanted something closer to a repeatable program: an agent that knows the main flows, understands who it\u2019s talking to, and can walk through the product without getting lost.<p>Over time this turned into three main components:<p>Planning/control layer<p>A loop that decides the next step: ask something, click, navigate, reset, etc. It uses a reasoning model, but only within a fixed set of allowed actions with guards (timeouts, depth limits, reset states). It never gets free control of the browser.<p>Browser execution layer<p>A controlled browser session, streamed in a video call. The agent can only interact with the elements we want. We log each action with a timestamp and the agent\u2019s \u201creason\u201d, which helps debug odd behavior.<p>Product knowledge layer<p>We ingest docs, demo scripts & videos, and usage analytics, to train the agent. At runtime, the agent uses its knowledge to decide what flow to show and how to explain it.<p>Some practical details and limitations:<p>We only support web apps right now. Desktop apps will come next.\nLLMs introduce non-determinism, so we bias toward safe, predictable behavior: checkpoints, conservative navigation, and \u201cescape hatches\u201d that reset to known states.\nIf the agent doesn\u2019t understand a UI state (unknown modal, layout shift, etc.), it asks the user instead of guessing.\nRegarding pricing, it\u2019s still early. We tailor it to each customer based on their needs. Our current thinking is a platform fee plus a per-call charge for the agent. The platform fee varies depending on complexity, support requirements, and overall scope.<p>People currently use Karumi for inbound demos and internal demo environments.

      "title": "Launch HN: Karumi (YC F25) \u2013 Personalized, agentic product demos",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Toni and Pablo, and we're building Karumi (<a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai\">https://www.karumi.ai</a>), a system that lets your users get instant, scalable, guided demos of your product, fully automated, zero human interaction. It works in any language.<p>Here's a demo video: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a>. There's also a live demo at  <a href=\"https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz\">https://www.karumi.ai/meet/start/phlz</a>.<p>Karumi is an AI agent that operates a real web app in a shared browser session and talks the user through it. Instead of a human giving a screen-share demo, the agent opens your product, clicks around, fills forms, and explains what it\u2019s doing. We started building this as an internal tool at our previous company. As the product grew, people kept asking \u201cwhat\u2019s the right way to demo feature X?\u201c. Docs and scripts became outdated quickly, and the quality of demos depended too much on who was presenting. We wanted something closer to a repeatable program: an agent that knows the main flows, understands who it\u2019s talking to, and can walk through the product without getting lost.<p>Over time this turned into three main components:<p>Planning/control layer<p>A loop that decides the next step: ask something, click, navigate, reset, etc. It uses a reasoning model, but only within a fixed set of allowed actions with guards (timeouts, depth limits, reset states). It never gets free control of the browser.<p>Browser execution layer<p>A controlled browser session, streamed in a video call. The agent can only interact with the elements we want. We log each action with a timestamp and the agent\u2019s \u201creason\u201d, which helps debug odd behavior.<p>Product knowledge layer<p>We ingest docs, demo scripts & videos, and usage analytics, to train the agent. At runtime, the agent uses its knowledge to decide what flow to show and how to explain it.<p>Some practical details and limitations:<p>We only support web apps right now. Desktop apps will come next.\nLLMs introduce non-determinism, so we bias toward safe, predictable behavior: checkpoints, conservative navigation, and \u201cescape hatches\u201d that reset to known states.\nIf the agent doesn\u2019t understand a UI state (unknown modal, layout shift, etc.), it asks the user instead of guessing.\nRegarding pricing, it\u2019s still early. We tailor it to each customer based on their needs. Our current thinking is a platform fee plus a per-call charge for the agent. The platform fee varies depending on complexity, support requirements, and overall scope.<p>People currently use Karumi for inbound demos and internal demo environments. If you want to see it inside a real product, here\u2019s Karumi running in Deel\u2019s platform: <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loom.com/share/e7f7e00f2284478e8335f8f4d4dac6bd</a><p>We\u2019ll be around to answer questions and look forward to your feedback!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46037416</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>",
