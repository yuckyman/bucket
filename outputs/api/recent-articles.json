      "title": "Parallelized Brightfield and Fluorescence Imaging of Organoids Using a Scalable Multi-Camera Platform",
      "content": "Organoid viability, maturation, and growth is commonly assayed through brightfield and fluorescence microscopy using a single objective lens. However, standard microscopic imaging systems pose significant limitations for high-throughput applications, particularly in large-scale experiments where simultaneous imaging of multiple organoids requires increased throughput. There is a strong need for systems that can capture organoid growth rapidly and consistently while minimizing disturbances to culture conditions. Here, we present a novel multi-camera array scanner (MCAS) that parallelizes imaging through the simultaneous use of 48 objective lenses and sensors, resulting in a 95% reduction in acquisition times compared to commercial high-content imagers. We demonstrate and validate this system in multiple well plate formats, in both 2D and 3D neural cell cultures, and in brightfield and fluorescence. The MCAS improves efficiency for measuring organoid growth rates, assessing responses to morphogens and drugs, and measuring viral transduction efficiency. Together, these findings establish the MCAS as a scalable and versatile imaging platform for rapid phenotyping in organoid research.",

      "title": "Exploring the likelihood of the membrane pollution hypothesis with a physiologically plausible biophysical model.",
      "content": "Epilepsy affects more than 52 million people worldwide and has been known since ancient times. Despite this long history, available therapeutic methods, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, fail to control seizures in over 10% of patients. At the same time, there exists a diversity of theories regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying epilepsy. Understanding the biophysical basis of the simplest manifestation of epileptic activity, the paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS), could therefore be highly valuable. Prevailing ideas consider PDS as exaggerated synaptic excitatory potentials, but experimental evidence shows that PDS can be generated in isolated neurons devoid of synaptic input. Ulrich Altrup proposed an alternative view, suggesting that PDS represent aberrantly large pacemaker potentials rather than giant excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Theoretical work by Hernandez-Caceres and Brenes supported this concept, demonstrating a bifurcation-like transformation from physiological pacemaker potentials to PDS and finally to long-duration sustained depolarizations. According to Altrup's membrane pollution hypothesis (MPH), epileptic activity emerges as a consequence of incorporating amphiphilic pollutants into neuronal membranes, which leads to an increase in membrane micro-viscosity. Using a biophysically sound model for pacemaker activity, we explored the possibility of eliciting PDS through increased membrane micro-viscosity. Provided results suggest that this is theoretically plausible. Further experimental and theoretical research is needed to refine details of the MPH and to develop new strategies for combating epilepsy.",

      "title": "Hormonal contraceptive use is associated with reduced central serotonergic activity indexed by the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials",
      "content": "ObjectiveHormonal contraceptives (HCs) are linked to mood disturbances, but the neurobiological mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated whether HC use is associated with altered central serotonergic activity, using the loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP).MethodsFifty-four healthy women (30 current HC users and 24 non-users) completed EEG recordings to assess LDAEP. Depressive symptoms were quantified using the Beck Depression Inventory-II. Between-group analyses were controlled for age and depressive symptoms, and effects of menstrual cycle phase, HC type, and mood-related side effects were also examined.ResultsHC users showed significantly steeper LDAEP slopes than non-users across components (all p\u202f\u2264\u202f0.028) consistent with reduced central serotonergic activity. This remained significant controlling for age and depressive symptoms. No significant effects of menstrual cycle phase or HC type, but HC users reporting adverse mood effects had more somatic symptoms, without corresponding LDAEP differences.ConclusionThis study is, to our knowledge, among the first to explicitly test an a priori hypothesis that HC use is associated with reduced serotonergic activity indexed by LDAEP in healthy women, and shows that HC use is linked to attenuated central serotonergic activity independent of mood symptoms. These findings underscore the role of sex hormones in shaping serotonergic function and may explain individual variability in mood and antidepressant response.",

      "title": "4D trajectory prediction for inbound flights",
      "content": "IntroductionTo address the challenges of cumulative errors, insufficient modeling of complex spatiotemporal features, and limitations in computational efficiency and generalization ability in 4D trajectory prediction, this paper proposes a high-precision, robust prediction method.MethodsA hybrid model SVMD-DBO-RCBAM is constructed, integrating sequential variational modal decomposition (SVMD), the dung beetle optimization algorithm (DBO), and the ResNet-CBAM network. Innovations include frequency-domain feature decoupling, dynamic parameter optimization, and enhanced spatio-temporal feature focusing.ResultsExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.DiscussionExperiments show that the model achieves a low longitude MAE of 0.0377 in single-step prediction, a 38.5% reduction compared to the baseline model; in multi-step prediction, the longitude R2 reaches 0.9844, with a 72.9% reduction in cumulative error rate and an IQR of prediction errors less than 10% of traditional models, demonstrating high accuracy and stability.",
