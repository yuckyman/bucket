      "title": "Exercise Leverages a Post-Stress Therapeutic Window in Hypothalamic CRH Neurons to Enable Recovery from Threat Sensitization",
      "content": "Exercise provides a range of benefits for physical and mental health. It relieves stress, yet paradoxically, it recruits the bodys stress response system. Here we show that activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone cells of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRHPVN) and the endocrine arm of the stress axis is necessary, but not sufficient for the beneficial effects of exercise. Specifically, glucocorticoids act synergistically with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on CRHPVN cells during exercise to reverse behavioral and synaptic sensitization after stress. In the absence of exercise, optogenetic activation of the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptor after stress is sufficient to reverse behavioral sensitization and synaptic metaplasticity. Our findings reveal a novel, time-sensitive mechanism by which exercise alleviates the impact of acute stress.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Global context rapidly shapes sensory responses in V1",
      "content": "Context modulates sensory processing in the cerebral cortex by suppressing responses to expected stimuli and enhancing responses to unexpected ones. Recent proposals argue that early sensory areas such as primary visual cortex (V1) are shaped only by local context, including recent stimulus history, whereas modulation by global context, such as learned temporal structure, is present exclusively in higher cortical areas. This view is incompatible with predictive coding theories. To directly dissociate local and global contextual influences, we used a global/local oddball paradigm in which mice viewed five-item sequences. Across conditions, sequence structure was held constant while stimulus identity and predictability were selectively manipulated, allowing the isolation of response modulations due to local deviance, global expectation, and stimulus repetition independently. In the canonical sequence (AAAA-B), B is locally deviant but globally predictable. Using two-photon calcium imaging and LFP recordings in mouse V1, we found that global predictability abolished context modulation: responses to B were equivalent to those evoked by a random sequence control (e.g., CDEAB). This effect emerged rapidly, after only <10 sequence repetitions, demonstrating fast learning of global structure. When the stimulus was globally deviant, either by replacing B with a novel stimulus (AAAA-C) or by presenting B unpredictably in a standard oddball paradigm, V1 exhibited robust response enhancement. These effects required feedback from anterior cingulate area (ACa), establishing a causal role for higher cortical circuits in conveying global predictions to V1. Strikingly, when an additional A replaced B (AAAA-A), responses were strongly suppressed despite global deviance, indicating that stimulus-specific adaptation may constrain the expression of global prediction error signals in early sensory cortex.",

      "title": "Acute, low-grade inflammation elevates white matter sensitivity to ischemia",
      "content": "Ischemic brain injuries, including stroke, are highly prevalent neurological diseases. Acute, low-grade inflammation, often resulting from peripheral infection, is a recognised risk factor. White matter axons, and their supporting glia, are susceptible to both ischemic and neuroinflammatory injury. The mechanisms behind ischemic and severe inflammatory injury in white matter are well established. However, the white matter response to acute, low-grade inflammation, and how this can interact with co-morbidities such as cerebral ischemia are yet to be examined. Here, we examine the response of white matter to acute, low-grade inflammation and the downstream effects this had on sensitivity of ischemia. Ex vivo mouse optic nerve and corpus callosum, central white matter tracts, tolerated acute, low-grade inflammation (110-minutes, 0.1ug/ml LPS), with preserved action potential conduction, limited microglial activation and no axo-myelinic damage. Exposure to these conditions elevated indicators of stress in oligodendrocytes which, when exposed to ischemic conditions (30 minutes oxygen-glucose deprivation), impaired their ability to maintain healthy myelin. There was a resulting increase in axo-myelinic damage and functional decline associated with ischemic conditions compared to white matter that had not been pre-exposed to LPS. Microglial depletion or dampening microglial responses with the clinically available drug minocycline eliminated the elevated sensitivity of white matter to ischemic injury associated with acute, low-grade inflammation. We demonstrate that acute, low-grade neuroinflammation primes white matter for heightened vulnerability to ischemic injury through microglial-mediated mechanisms. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of ischemic brain injury observed during systemic inflammatory states and highlights microglial modulation as a clinical strategy to mitigate ischemic damage in susceptible patients.",

      "content": "Human time perception is flexible and shaped by both structural constraints and contextual influences. Disentangling these sources of bias is essential for understanding the predictive mechanisms underlying temporal perception, yet no unified model currently integrates them. Here, we quantified precisely the structural and contextual biases in a duration discrimination task to constrain models of duration perception. Using a duration discrimination task, healthy participants judged which of two consecutive stimuli lasted longer. Stimuli were visual, auditory, or cross-modal. Consistent with previous findings, auditory stimuli were perceived as longer than visual stimuli of equal duration, reflecting intrinsic properties of audiovisual neural processing. Contextual biases were manipulated through different duration distributions known to influence temporal judgments. Our results show that duration discrimination relies on distinct representations of each stimulus distribution and is best explained by a combination of Bayesian inference and rescaling. While Bayesian inference accounts for contextual effects such as regression to the mean, rescaling mechanisms predict opposite effects by correcting perceived durations after repeated exposure. These findings challenge existing accounts of contextual effects in time perception and suggest that the brain normalizes temporal representations to adapt to environmental statistics.",

      "content": "Sleep deprivation (SD) is increasingly prevalent and known to impair declarative memory, yet its impacts on the acquisition and consolidation of procedural skills remains unknown. Physical exercise has emerged as a promising intervention for promoting learning and plasticity, but its potential to mitigate SD-induced deficits has never been tested. Here, we investigated whether SD disrupts sequential motor learning (SML) and whether high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) performed after acquisition can influence consolidation. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups combining one night of SD or normal sleep condition with HIIE or control intervention. SD elevated cortisol and sleepiness without affecting brain-derived neurotrophic factor or corticospinal excitability. Behaviorally, SD selectively impaired the movement time execution of SML acquisition, while HIIE reduced the movement accuracy during consolidation, regardless of sleep condition. These findings reveal a component-specific vulnerability of procedural memory to SD and challenge the assumption that exercise consistently enhances consolidation following motor learning.",

      "title": "<em>Psychomusicology</em>: A resounding closing cadence.",
      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.
