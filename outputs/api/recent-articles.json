      "title": "Behaviorally relevant cell ensembles in rat motor cortex are replayed during sleep and implicate hippocampal involvement in motor skill learning",
      "content": "Motor memory is essential for our daily activities. It involves complex neural processes during learning and sleep. However, unlike explicit memory where its neural activation and role in memory consolidation are well-studied, the properties of cell ensembles for motor memory are less understood. In this study, we re-examined rats' behavior and neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) and hippocampus while the animals were trained daily on a single-pellet reaching task. Recordings included both the training and 3 hr rest epochs before and after training. Behaviorally, the animals were classified into two learning types: rapid and gradual learners. Unsupervised cell ensemble detection on M1 neurons revealed that about 60% of the ensembles were modulated during reaching behavior. Those reach-related ensembles were further categorized into four types, and their replay was detected during both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep. In SWS, replay preferentially occurred during spindles, especially slow-oscillation coupled spindles (SO-spindles). In addition, about 30% of the reach-related cell ensembles were modulated during the hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). The direction of modulation and the temporal coupling between SWRs and SO-spindles depended on the training phase and the animals' learning types. Our results demonstrate the replay of rats' skilled-reaching memory during SWS and REM sleep and the possible involvement of the hippocampus through the modulation of M1 activations during SWRs. This study will advance our understanding of how neural activity patterns evolve during skilled-reaching learning and sleep, and help develop medical applications that leverage sleep's memory functions.",

      "title": "Cognitive Resilience in Aging Degus is Linked to CA3 Hippocampal GABAergic Integrity",
      "content": "The preservation of cognitive function during aging remains a key challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we applied an integrative approach, combining behavioral assays with neurophysiological recordings, to investigate hippocampal circuit integrity. We used Octodon degus, a rodent with exceptional longevity (up to 10 years in laboratory conditions), as a natural model of aging and neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer. To assess age-related cognitive changes, we employed three behavioral tasks: Novel Object Recognition (NOR), Open Field (OF), and the Burrowing Test (BT). The BT reflects Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and is based on species-typical spontaneous burrowing behavior, which has been linked to neurodegenerative markers in degus. We also performed multielectrode electrophysiological recordings to assess GABAergic function in the hippocampus. Aged degus with high BT performance (classified as good burrowers, or GB) showed robust hippocampal activity, especially in the CA3 region, a key hub for signal integration and memory encoding. In contrast, degus with poor BT performance (bad burrowers, or BB) exhibited reduced spontaneous hippocampal activity, suggesting potential compensation via GABA-independent synaptic mechanisms. Altogether, our findings suggest that preserved GABAergic function supports cognitive resilience in aging degus. These results offer new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying healthy cognitive aging and may inform future strategies for preventing or mitigating neurodegeneration.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has been hindered by the lack of models that faithfully recapitulate the full profile of disease progression in a human genetic background. We developed a 3D assembloid model (\"Masteroid\") using iPSC-derived neurons, astrocytes, and microglia from APOE4/4 and isogenic control lines. Neurons were seeded with tau oligomers, then combined with astrocytes and microglia to form mature 3D Masteroids, followed by amyloid-{beta} oligomer exposure. After four weeks, AD-Masteroids exhibited hallmark pathologies, including extracellular amyloid-{beta} deposits, intracellular tau aggregation, neurodegeneration, astrogliosis, and microglial activation, with APOE4 exacerbating all phenotypes. Single-cell RNA sequencing further identified novel roles of IGFBP pathways in amyloid-{beta} and tau-mediated pathology. This innovative platform provides a robust system to dissect cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD progression and offers a powerful tool for therapeutic discovery.",

      "title": "The spatiotemporal structure of neural activity in motor cortex during reaching",
      "content": "Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCI) leverage knowledge about neural representations to translate movement-related neural activity into actions. BCI implants have targeted broad cortical regions known to have relevant motor representations, but emerging technologies will allow flexible targeting to specific neural populations. The structure of motor representations at this scale, however, has not been well characterized across frontal motor cortices. Here, we investigate how motor representations and population dynamics (temporal coordination) vary across a large expanse of frontal motor cortices. We used high-density, laminar, microelectrode arrays to simultaneously record many neurons and then sampled neural populations across frontal motor cortex in two monkeys while they performed a reaching task. Our experiments allowed us to map neuronal activity across three spatial dimensions and relate them to movement. Target decoding analysis revealed that task information was heterogeneously distributed across the cortical surface and in depth. Similarly, we found that the temporal dynamics of different neural populations were heterogeneous, but that the amount of task information predicted which neural populations had similar dynamics. The neural populations with the most similar dynamics were composed of neurons with high task information regardless of spatial location. Our results highlight the spatiotemporal complexity of motor representations across frontal motor cortex at the level of neurons and neural populations, where well-learned movements consistently recruit a spatially distributed subset of neurons. Further insights into the spatiotemporal structure of neural activity patterns across frontal motor cortex will be critical to guide future implants for improved BCI performance.",

      "title": "The neural basis of emotional generalization in empathy",
      "content": "The essence of empathy is generalization of emotion across persons. Here, we leverage recent theoretical advances in the neuroscience of generalization to help us understand empathy. We measured brain activity in human neurosurgical patients performing two tasks, one focused on identifying their own emotional response and one identifying emotional responses in others. We quantified the representational geometry of local field potential (LFP) high-gamma activity in four regions: the medial temporal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. We found encoding of both self- and other-emotions in all four regions, but codes for emotion and person are disentangled (that is, factorized) in the insula, but not the other regions. This factorized representation allows for cross-person generalization of emotion in a way that tangled (non-factorized) representations do not. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the insula uniquely contributes to social mirroring processes by which we understand emotions across individuals.",

      "content": "Retinal ganglion cells have traditionally been grouped into cells that are sensitive to luminance but not spatial structure and cells with responses that are enhanced by spatial structure. Neither category captures responses of mouse Off Transient alpha cells, which are largest for spatially homogeneous inputs and are suppressed by spatial structure. We identified two circuit mechanisms that together can explain this unusual spatial selectivity. First, inhibition to these cells is tuned to finer spatial structure than excitation, causing the balance of excitation and inhibition to depend on spatial scale. Second, the excitatory synapses onto these cells undergo strong synaptic depression and the modulation of that depression by presynaptic inhibition amplifies responses to the transition from spatially structured to homogeneous inputs. A spatiotemporal computational model incorporating these circuit features quantitatively recapitulates the observed dynamics. These findings reveal how localized inhibition and short-term plasticity jointly create the distinctive spatial selectivity of Off Transient cells.",

      "content": "The transcriptome of a brain cell encodes both its stable identity and its dynamic responses to environmental stimuli. While significant progress has been made in categorizing cell types within the brain, deciphering to what extent transcriptional identity and transcriptional state are related remains a major technical and conceptual challenge. Here, we present a single-nucleus RNA-sequencing atlas of the mouse hippocampus spanning physiological and pathological stimuli and multiple circadian phases, enabling unified analysis of activity-, circadian-, and cell-type-dependent transcriptional programs. Taxonomically assigned cell types are largely stable despite the induction of different activity states, with a notable exception in the dentate gyrus. Activity and circadian rhythm each drive robust, largely nonoverlapping transcriptional responses, with convergent regulation on genes involved in specific pathways, including endocannabinoid signaling, excitability, and chromatin remodeling. These results underscore the necessity of integrating cell-type taxonomy with transcriptional state to capture how diverse cell types respond to experience.",

      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",

      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "content": "Overcoming visual degradation in challenging imaging scenarios is essential for accurate scene understanding. Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose DWMamba, a degradation-aware and weight-efficient Mamba network for image quality enhancement. Specifically, DWMamba introduces an Adaptive State Space Module (ASSM) that employs a dual-stream channel monitoring mechanism and a soft fusion strategy to capture global dependencies. With linear computational complexity, ASSM strengthens the models ability to address non-uniform degradations. In addition, by leveraging explicit edge priors and region partitioning as guidance, we design a Structure-guided Residual Fusion (SGRF) module to selectively fuse shallow and deep features, thereby restoring degraded details and enhancing low-light textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network delivers superior qualitative and quantitative performance, with strong generalization to diverse extreme lighting conditions.

      "content": "IntroductionAnodal direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) of the visual cortex is a potential rehabilitation tool for vision disorders such as amblyopia and macular degeneration. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are currently unknown. When applied to the human motor cortex, a-tDCS reduces the concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter that modulates neuroplasticity. Our primary aim was to assess whether the same a-tDCS paradigm alters local GABA concentration when applied to the healthy primary visual cortex. We also measured the effect of a-tDCS on visual cortex resting-state connectivity and sought to replicate reported observations of an association between visual cortex GABA concentration and the dynamics of binocular rivalry.MethodsFourteen participants with normal vision completed two brain imaging sessions at least 48 hours apart. In each session, binocular rivalry dynamics, primary visual cortex GABA and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) concentrations (via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) and resting-state functional connectivity (via task-free fMRI) were measured at baseline. Real or sham a-tDCS (20 min, 2mA) was then applied to the visual cortex in a randomized sequence followed by a second set of MRS and fMRI measurements.ResultsNo between-session effects of a-tDCS on GABA or Glx concentration or resting-state functional connectivity were observed. A pre-planned within-session analysis revealed a significant increase in Glx following a-tDCS that did not withstand multiple comparisons correction. No consistent relationships between binocular rivalry dynamics and GABA concentration were apparent.DiscussionTogether, our results suggest that a-tDCS effects on the visual cortex may differ from the GABA-associated mechanism in motor cortex.",

      "title": "A pipelined, resource-efficient convolutional neural network architecture for detecting and diagnosing Alzheimer's disease using brain sMRI",
      "content": "IntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs memory and cognitive function in elderly individuals. Early detection is vital to slow disease progression and enable timely therapeutic intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches for AD, however, often involve high time complexity and significant computational resource utilization, highlighting the need for more efficient automated solutions.MethodsThis study introduces a Resource Efficient Convolutional Neural Network (RECNN) framework for AD detection and diagnosis using brain MRI images. The methodology incorporates three main modules: Gabor transformation, data augmentation, and classification with an anomalous pixel segmentation algorithm. Gabor transforms are employed to enhance spatial frequency features and improve detection rates. Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of training samples. The RECNN classifier is then used for image classification, and functional morphological segmentation is applied to classify affected pixels into mild or advanced stages of AD. Two benchmark datasets are utilized for training and testing the proposed framework.ResultsThe proposed RECNN-based system demonstrated superior detection and classification performance compared with conventional AD detection methods. The model achieved improved accuracy and robustness, with segmentation results enabling the differentiation between mild and advanced AD cases. Comparative evaluation confirmed that RECNN significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high diagnostic reliability.DiscussionThe findings suggest that the RECNN framework offers a resource-efficient and accurate approach for AD detection using MRI data. By combining Gabor-based feature transformation, augmented data diversity, and advanced segmentation, the proposed method provides a scalable and clinically applicable tool for early diagnosis. Future work will extend the model to larger and more diverse datasets and explore hybrid architectures to further enhance diagnostic performance.",

      "title": "Balancing accuracy and efficiency: co-design of hybrid quantization and unified computing architecture for spiking neural networks",
      "content": "The deployment of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is hindered by a critical algorithm-hardware mismatch: a fundamental trade-off between the accuracy degradation caused by aggressive quantization and the resource redundancy stemming from traditional decoupled hardware designs. To bridge this gap, we present a novel algorithm-hardware co-design framework centered on a Ternary-8-bit Hybrid Weight Quantization (T8HWQ) scheme. Our approach recasts SNN computation into a unified \u201c8-bit \u00d7 2-bit\u201d paradigm by quantizing first-layer weights to 2 bits and subsequent layers to 8 bits. This standardization directly enables the design of a unified PE architecture, eliminating the resource redundancy inherent in decoupled designs. To mitigate the accuracy degradation caused by aggressive first-layer quantization, we first propose a channel-wise dual compensation strategy. This method synergizes channel-wise quantization optimization with adaptive threshold neurons, leveraging reparameterization techniques to restore model accuracy without incurring additional inference overhead. Building upon T8HWQ, we propose a novel unified computing architecture that overcomes the inefficiencies of traditional decoupled designs by efficiently multiplexing processing arrays. Experimental results support our approach: On CIFAR-100, our method achieves near-lossless accuracy (<0.7% degradation vs. full precision) with a single time step, matching state-of-the-art low-bit SNNs. At the hardware level, implementation results on the Xilinx Virtex 7 platform demonstrate that our unified computing unit conserves 20.2% of lookup table (LUT) resources compared to traditional decoupled architectures. This work delivers a 6\u202f\u00d7\u202fthroughput improvement over state-of-the-art SNN accelerators\u2014with comparable resource utilization and lower power consumption. Our integrated solution thus advances the practical implementation of high-performance, low-latency SNNs on resource-constrained edge devices.",

      "title": "Does spatialized audio enhance the creation of mental representations?",
      "content": "Navigating unfamiliar environments without vision is a considerable challenge for blind individuals, as it requires constructing accurate cognitive maps. Binaural audio feedback, which delivers spatialized auditory cues, has been proposed as a means of enhancing spatial navigation by leveraging the auditory system's natural ability to localize sounds in three dimensions. This study investigated whether binaural audio feedback offers measurable advantages over non-spatialized feedback in supporting spatial perception and mental representation. Fourteen participants, seven blind individuals and seven blindfolded sighted individuals, explored controlled environments under both feedback conditions and reconstructed the layouts using LEGO models. Performance was evaluated through spatial correlation analysis and distance accuracy measures. Results revealed no significant differences between binaural and non-spatialized conditions for either group. These findings indicate that spatialization of descriptive audio alone may not be sufficient to enhance spatial representations, suggesting that factors such as prior training, task design, and integration with other sensory cues may be critical for unlocking the full potential of binaural audio in assistive navigation.",
