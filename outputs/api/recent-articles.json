      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "content": "IntroductionAccurate localization of the epileptogenic zone is essential for surgical treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. Standard presurgical evaluations rely on multimodal neuroimaging techniques, but these may be limited by availability and interpretive challenges. This study aimed to assess the concordance between zones identified by ictal semiology and a novel distributed electrical source localization technique, CLARA, and to evaluate their impact on postsurgical outcomes.MethodsThis retrospective study included 16 patients with at least three recorded seizures. Ictal semiology was analyzed subjectively using video electroencephalography (VEEG) by a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neurophysiologists, and radiologists, who determined the presumed epileptogenic zone at the lobar level. CLARA was subsequently applied to identify the computed zone based on ictal and/or interictal biomarker activities. The concordance between the presumed and computed zones was assessed qualitatively. Postsurgical outcomes were examined in relation to the extent of resection of the CLARA-defined zones.ResultsAmong thirteen patients with sufficient data for analysis, qualitative comparison showed 77% concordance and 23% partial concordance between the presumed and computed zones. Postsurgical follow-up revealed seizure freedom in one patient with cavernoma following complete resection of the CLARA-defined zone. In contrast, patients with incomplete resection of this region continued to experience seizures.DiscussionThe findings support the potential value of CLARA as an adjunctive neuroimaging technique in the presurgical evaluation of epilepsy. By providing an additional layer of verification, CLARA may improve the accuracy of epileptogenic zone localization when used alongside established modalities such as PET, SPECT, fMRI, and MRI. Its adaptability and lower resource requirements suggest particular utility in centers with limited access to advanced medical equipment and specialized personnel. Broader implementation of CLARA could enhance presurgical decision-making and contribute to improved surgical outcomes for epilepsy patients.",

      "title": "Effects of AC induced electric fields on neuronal firing sensitivity and activity patterns",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding how neurons respond to time-varying electric fields is essential for both basic neuroscience and the development of neuromodulation strategies. However, the mechanisms by which alternating-current induced electric fields (AC-IEF) influence neuronal sensitivity and firing remain unclear.MethodsWe developed a modified two-compartment Pinsky\u2013Rinzel (PR) neuron model incorporating AC-IEF stimulation. Using systematic simulations, we examined firing responses across a wide range of field frequencies, amplitudes, and intrinsic membrane parameters, including inter-compartmental conductance and potassium reversal potential.ResultsNeurons exhibited no firing or sensitivity when the field amplitude was less than twice the baseline membrane potential, regardless of conductance or reversal potential. Sensitivity increased markedly with amplitude: for example, when the amplitude exceeded 0.5 mV/cm, maximum firing rates rose by up to 45% and the sensitivity frequency range extended to 10\u201350 Hz. Phase-locking phenomena (1:1 and 2:1) were observed, with bandwidths widening as amplitude increased. For amplitudes below 30 mV, firing pattern transitions depended strongly on inter-compartmental conductance, whereas amplitudes \u226530 mV produced a consistent progression ending in subthreshold oscillations. Similar parameter-dependent transitions occurred for different potassium reversal potentials, converging at high amplitudes.DiscussionThese results reveal a parameter-dependent mechanism by which AC-IEF modulate neuronal excitability. The findings provide qualitative rather than strictly quantitative insights into how external electromagnetic environments can shape neural activity, offering new directions for targeted neuromodulation in both health and disease.",

      "title": "Intrinsic calcium resonance and its modulation: insights from computational modeling",
      "content": "Hippocampal neurons generate membrane potential resonance due to specific voltage-gated ion channels, known as resonating conductances, which play crucial physiological roles. However, it is not known whether this phenomenon of resonance is limited to membrane voltage or whether it propagates through molecular signaling components such as calcium dynamics. To test this, we first utilized a single-compartment model neuron to study the oscillatory intrinsic calcium response dynamics of hippocampal model neurons, and the effects of T-type calcium channel kinetics on the voltage and calcium resonance. We found that in the presence of T-type calcium channels, our model neuron sustained a strong calcium resonance compared to voltage resonance. Unlike voltage resonance, calcium resonance frequency was largely independent of conductance magnitude, and the two types of resonance were dissociated, meaning independent of each other. In addition, we studied the effects of A-type K+-channels and h-channels in conjunction with T-type calcium channels on calcium resonance, and showed that these two types of channels differentially affect calcium resonance. Finally, using a multi-compartmental morphologically realistic neuron model, we studied calcium resonance along the somato-apical dendritic axis. Using this model, we found that calcium resonance frequency remains almost constant along the somato-apical trunk for the most part, and only toward its terminal end, the calcium resonance frequency was increased. Nonetheless, this increase was lesser compared to the increase in voltage resonance frequency. Our study opens new horizons in the field of molecular resonance, and deepen our understanding concerning the effects of frequency-based neurostimulation therapies, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS).",

      "content": "ObjectivesNight-shift work is associated with cognitive impairments, but convenient, effective, and acceptable traditional Chinese medicine-based interventions remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auricular acupressure combined with auricular acupoint massage on cognitive function in night-shift nurses, using P300 wave parameters from electroencephalography analysis as objective metrics.MethodsEighty nurses (40 days-shift, 40 night-shift) participated. The intervention included auricular acupressure and massage targeting six points, performed daily for 4 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). P300 amplitude and latency were measured.ResultsNight-shift nurses had significantly higher ISI scores and lower MoCA attention, memory, and total scores compared to day-shift nurses (all p < 0.05). Before the intervention, After FDR correction for multiple comparisons, P300 amplitude was significantly lower at the T4 electrode site (q = 0.020) in the night-shift group. P300 latency remained significantly prolonged at sites Fz (q = 0.020), F3 (q < 0.001), F4 (q = 0.035), and T5 (q = 0.033). Post-intervention, the night-shift group demonstrated significant increases in P300 amplitude at F3, F4, T3, T4, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05) and significant reductions in P300 latency at Fz, F4, F7, T5, and T6 (all q < 0.05). Notably, several sites with affected P300 amplitude and latency before the intervention showed significant improvement following intervention.ConclusionAuricular acupressure and massage significantly improved cognitive function in night-shift nurses, evidenced by enhanced P300 parameters. This non-invasive, cost-effective intervention shows promise for alleviating cognitive impairments from shift work.",

      "title": "An interpretable generative multimodal neuroimaging-genomics framework for decoding Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Objective. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia worldwide, encompassing a prodromal stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where patients may either progress to AD or remain stable. The objective of the work was to capture structural and functional modulations of brain structure and function relying on multimodal MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphisms, also in case of missing views, with the twofold goal of classifying AD patients versus healthy controls and detecting MCI converters. Approach. We propose a multimodal deep learning (DL)-based classification framework where a generative module employing cycle generative adversarial networks was introduced in the latent space for imputing missing data (a common issue of multimodal approaches). Explainable AI method was then used to extract input features\u2019 relevance allowing for post-hoc validation and enhancing the interpretability of the learned representations. Main results. Experimental results on two tasks, AD detection and MCI conversion, showed that our framework reached competitive performance in the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of (CI [0.90, 0.95]) and (CI [0.70, 0.72]) in the two tasks, respectively. The interpretability analysis revealed gray matter modulations in cortical and subcortical brain areas typically associated with AD. Moreover, impairments in sensory-motor and visual resting state networks along the disease continuum, as well as genetic mutations defining biological processes linked to endocytosis, amyloid-beta, and cholesterol, were identified. Significance. Our integrative and interpretable DL approach shows promising performance for AD detection and MCI prediction while shedding light on important biological insights.",

      "title": "EEG workload estimation and classification: a systematic review",
      "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) has evolved into an indispensable instrument for estimating cognitive workload in various domains. Machine Learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been increasingly employed to develop accurate workload estimation and classification models based on EEG data. The goal of this systematic review is to compile the body of research on EEG workload estimation and classification using ML and DL approaches. Methods. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures were followed in conducting the review, searches were conducted through databases at SpringerLink, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Explore, PubMed, and Science Direct from the beginning to the end of 16 February 2024. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria. Data were extracted to capture study design, participant demographics, EEG features, ML/DL algorithms, and reported performance metrics. Results. Out of the 125 items that emerged, 33 scientific papers were fully evaluated. The study designs, participant demographics, and EEG workload measurement and categorization techniques used in the investigations differed. Support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and hybrid networks are examples of ML and DL approaches that were often used. Analyzing the accuracy scores achieved by different ML/DL models. Furthermore, a relationship was noted between sample frequency and model accuracy, with higher sample frequencies generally leading to improved performance. The percentage distribution of ML/DL methods revealed that SVMs, CNNs, and recurrent neural networks were the most commonly utilized techniques, reflecting their robustness in handling EEG data. Significance. The comprehensive review emphasizes how ML may be used to identify mental workload across a variety of disciplines using EEG data. Optimizing practical applications requires multimodal data integration, standardization efforts, and real-world validation studies. These systems will also be further improved by addressing ethical issues and investigating new EEG properties, which will improve human\u2013computer interaction and performance assessment.",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
