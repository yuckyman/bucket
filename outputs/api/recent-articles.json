      "title": "Asymmetries in hue measured behaviorally and with visual evoked potentials",
      "content": "Hue percepts vary more rapidly along some directions in color space (e.g. near yellow) than others (e.g. near green) with corresponding differences in the size or stimulus range of different hue categories. The basis for these differences is not known. We examined whether the asymmetries are present in early cortical color coding by comparing the strength of hue differences using visual evoked potentials (VEPs) recorded from occipital cortex. Stimuli were spatial gratings with a fixed nominal contrast in the cone-opponent plane that varied sinusoidally in hue rather than saturation. The responses to different levels of hue separation were measured by the amplitude of the frequency-tagged signals and also in behavioral measurements employing a contrast matching task. For both, the same separation in hue angle resulted in stronger responses for angular differences centered on the yellow quadrant of the cone-opponent space. Responses were also larger for the yellow than blue quadrant, ruling out a general sensitivity loss to the blue-yellow axis as the basis for the differences. The responses differences paralleled the asymmetries in the rates of change in color appearance based on analyses of previous measures of hue scaling functions. The presence of these asymmetries in the VEP responses suggests that they arise relatively early in the cortical sensory representation of color rather than emerging late as a product of inference or color category learning.",

      "title": "Memory recall errors reflect interacting sensory and mnemonic representations",
      "content": "Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance of information that is no longer present in the environment. Some accounts propose that WM is supported by abstract representations so that new sensory inputs do not interfere with existing memories. Others posit that early sensory representations are recruited to maintain memory precision, potentially at the cost of interference caused by new inputs. Here we tested these accounts using an orientation recall task to determine whether memory errors reflect interacting representations of sensory and mnemonic information. We found that adding noise to the memoranda and presenting feature-neutral distractors independently increased recall errors. However, distractors that shared a feature with remembered stimuli led to systematic attractive biases such that memory errors were pulled toward the orientation of the distractor. The magnitude of this bias was modulated by both stimulus noise and whether the distractor was behaviorally relevant. Our results demonstrate that while working memory can utilize abstract representations, it remains susceptible to feature-specific sensory interference, suggesting partial reliance on sensory-like codes.",

      "title": "Nuclear receptor-neurotransmitter coupling links behavior to metabolic state",
      "content": "Animals must flexibly respond to environmental stimuli to survive, and optimal responses critically depend on the organism's current needs. Many organisms have evolved both cell-intrinsic and intertissue signaling pathways that integrate metabolic status. However, how this information is encoded in molecular signals is currently not well understood. Here we show that the nematode C. elegans employs lipidated neurohormones that combine the neurotransmitter octopamine and fat metabolism-derived building blocks to relay information about lipid metabolic status and drive inhibition of aversive olfactory responses during food removal. Using targeted metabolomics, we show that lipidated neurohormone synthesis requires the carboxylesterase CEST-2.1, which links octopamine-glucosides with endogenous methyl-branched or diet-derived cyclopropane fatty acids that act as agonists of the nuclear receptor and master regulator of fat metabolism, NHR-49/PPAR. Loss of cest-2.1, loss of bacterial cyclopropane fatty acid production, or loss of endogenous biosynthesis of the methyl-branched fatty acid substrates of CEST-2.1 mimics the behavioral responses of animals lacking octopamine, indicating that regulation of neurotransmitter-dependent behavior is linked to the coordination of fat metabolism via NHR-49/PPAR. Biosynthesis and subsequent neuromodulation via lipidated neurohormone relies on an intertissue trafficking pathway in which octopamine is shuttled first into the intestine where it is chemically modified, which is likely followed by neuronal import and intracellular hydrolysis to finally release free octopamine. We propose that esterase-dependent synthesis and subsequent hydrolysis of lipidated neurohormones represents a chemical encoding mechanism by which animals integrate information from neurotransmitter signaling and lipid homeostasis to direct appropriate behaviors.",

      "title": "Voluntary Dissociation of Motor Unit Activity in the Vastii Muscles",
      "content": "The CNS coordinates movement through consistent activation patterns across muscles and motor units, suggesting the presence of a relatively fixed and high-dimensional number of neural constraints on voluntary actions. In the human quadriceps, the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) control the knee extensor torque and are considered a synergistic pair largely activated by shared neural inputs. However, some evidence suggests that these muscles, or even subregions within them, can be controlled independently. In this study, we investigated whether humans can dissociate neural input to VM and VL during isometric contractions. Ten participants received real-time feedback from multiple intramuscular EMG electrodes that targeted different regions of the VM and VL while attempting to activate each muscle or sub-regions selectively. We found that nine out of ten subjects were able to clearly separate VM and VL activity based on the intramuscular EMG feedback. However, motor unit decomposition from the intramuscular EMGs revealed that selective recruitment of a unique set of motor units was possible only within the proximal region of VM. In contrast, VL and distal VM showed highly correlated activation, indicating tight functional coupling. Correlation analyses confirmed that the proximal VM exhibited distinct activation profiles compared with both distal VM and VL, supporting the existence of compartmentalized control within VM. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to dissociate the activation of motor units within this synergistic muscle group during low-force isometric contractions.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease risk factors are expressed at brain barriers.",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but whether its etiology is cell autonomous remains unclear. Increasing evidence implicates the blood-central nervous system (CNS) barriers in disease development, highlighting the importance of identifying genetic risk factors linked to cells forming the cerebrovasculature to advance this emerging area of research. The objective of this study is to identify PD genetic risk factors associated with blood-brain (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (BCSFB) barriers, and to validate protein localization in human tissue and experimental models. To do so, we integrated genome-wide association studies and single nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets from the human postmortem substantia nigra (SN), midbrain, or cortical samples from control and PD donors. An in-depth bioinformatics analysis identified genes enriched in cell types that form the multicellular architecture of brain barriers, including CAVIN2, ANXA1, ANO2, and LRP1B. We further validated whether corresponding proteins were present in cell types associated with the blood-CNS barriers in human and mouse post-mortem tissues, as well as in iPSC-differentiated cells and choroid plexus organoids. Results showed that quantifying the proportion of endothelial cells expressing PD-related genes was under-evaluated at the transcript level compared to immunofluorescence analyses. In addition, we observed that CAVIN2 and ANXA1 proteins were more abundant at the vasculature of the substantia nigra vs. cortex, and CAVIN2 protein levels were reduced in PD vs. control human postmortem tissues. In contrast, the investigation of mouse postmortem samples demonstrated that the CAVIN2 protein is only present in a subset of mouse blood vessels, compared to nearly all vessels in human tissue. Similarly, mouse ANXA1 protein localizes to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and not at the vasculature, as seen in human tissue. The primary outcome of this study is the identification of PD-relevant risk genes specifically expressed at brain barriers and enriched in PD-relevant brain regions. The secondary outcome is the demonstration of poor transcript-protein correlation in - at least - a subset of PD risk factors, and a low interspecies conservation of protein localization for the selected candidates. In conclusion, the BBB and BCSFB may represent understudied contributors to PD, endothelial-specific proteins appear differentially regulated compared to transcripts, and experimental models require comprehensive validation to ensure relevance to the human condition.",

In contrast, the manipulation of oli-godendrocytes requires the Cre-LoxP system and gene-by-gene engineering, breeding, and genotyping. Here we introduce OASIS (Oligodendrocyte AAV-CRISPR mediated Specific In vivo editing System), a ver-satile platform that combines SELECTIV, an AAV-receptor-based transduction strategy, with HiUGE, an NHEJ-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in approach. We show efficient and specific oligodendrocyte trans-duction across the brain and tagging of endogenous cytoskeletal, myelin, cell adhesion, scaffolding, and junctional proteins. OASIS enables sparse yet reliable labeling, allowing direct visualization of subcellular protein localization with single-cell resolution. We successfully fused the biotin-ligase TurboID with endogenous oligodendroglial Neurofascin-155, thereby achieving targeted biotinylation of the axoglial junction. OASIS is rapidly customizable for any gene-of-interest. Together, OASIS overcomes longstand-ing barriers in oligodendrocyte biology, providing a powerful system for precise, customizable genome editing and subcellular visualization in the adult brain.",

      "title": "Pro-endometriosis macrophage release of IL-33 is key for endometriosis pain and lesion formation",
      "content": "Endometriosis is a painful gynecological inflammatory disease affecting up to 10% of females. When released by sensory neurons, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) shapes immunity, a process known as neuroimmune communication. We previously showed that nociceptor-derived CGRP polarizes macrophages into pro-endometriosis macrophages (PEMs) that mediates endometrial epithelial (endo-epi) cell growth and pain. However, the key mediators involved in this PEM-induced cell growth were unknown. Using unbiased approaches, we discovered that nociceptor-derived CGRP induces IL-33 production by PEMs. IL-33 binding to its receptor ST2 is key for endometriotic lesion growth and pain during endometriosis in mice as anti-IL-33 antibody treatment reduced evoked and spontaneous pain as well as lesion size. Chemical or genetic ablation of nociceptors or macrophages also resulted in lower levels of lesion IL-33, demonstrating a neuroimmune-driven mechanism for IL-33 production during endometriosis. In humans, we found that IL-33 is correlated with increased number of glands and fibrosis in lesions and that IL-33 expression in macrophages is also associated with genetic risk of endometriosis. We also provided evidence that suggests a dual role for IL-33 in endometriosis, in which, it is initially required for lesion formation and later for lesion maintenance only, and associated pain. Therefore, targeting IL-33/ST2 signaling may effectively treat endometriosis pain.",
