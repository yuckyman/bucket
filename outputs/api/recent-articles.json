      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

Advances in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have rapidly accelerated in the last decade that promises to improve the quality of life of patients with communications, sensory, and motor control disabilities. Approach. In this Perspective, we quantify the extent and nature of scientific convergence across 21 research groups conducting iBCI clinical trials worldwide. Using medical subject headers and Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomies, we analyze topical and disciplinary integration within 161 publications from 1998\u20132023 to assess how deeply team composition aligns with research themes and translational impact. Main Results. Our findings indicate uneven patterns of convergence, with many teams combining engineering and clinical expertise yet omitting ethical, legal, and social dimensions. This represents what we term short-cut convergence. Significance. We propose an operational definition of this phenomenon and identify practical steps for researchers and funders to strengthen full convergence to accelerate iBCI translation and implementation.",

      "title": "Electrical characterization and accelerated aging of amorphous silicon carbide implantable encapsulation",
      "content": "Objective. Chronically implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used for stimulating and recording neural activity in research and clinical settings. However, their reliability can be compromised by insufficient encapsulation stability. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), a chemically stable and biocompatible material, has emerged as a potential thin-film encapsulation for MEAs. We aimed to evaluate thin-film a-SiC encapsulation using electrical-accelerated aging (EAA) and to demonstrate a methodology for obtaining acceleration factors for EAA by Weibull analysis. Approach. Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) encapsulated with a-SiC were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped-voltage protocols to measure leakage currents in buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. EAA employed incrementally increasing voltage biases over time to induce degradation and reveal failure mechanisms. Main results. IDEs exhibited a significant change in electrical behavior on exposure to saline, with failure initiating at specific voltages and accompanied by gas evolution at defect sites. Incremental voltage biasing revealed a capacitive-to-faradaic transition in leakage current response that was used as a failure criterion. Significance. Acceleration factors for voltage-driven accelerated aging of a-SiC thin-film encapsulation can be obtained by Weibull analysis using a mechanistic failure criterion. Breakdown occurs at processing-related defects in the a-SiC. This study demonstrates the use of EAA for evaluating failure in a-SiC thin-film encapsulation used in implantable MEAs. EAA is broadly applicable to thin-film MEAs and provides a highly relevant method of predicting implanted lifetimes of bioelectronics.",

      "content": "Objective. Stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) is a mesoscale intracranial monitoring technique that records from the brain volumetrically with depth electrodes. sEEG is typically used for monitoring of epileptic foci, but can also serve as a useful tool to study distributed brain dynamics. Herein, we detail the implementation of sEEG-based brain-computer interfacing (BCI) across a diverse and large patient cohort. Approach. Across 27 subjects (15 female, 31 total feedback experiments), we identified channels with increases in broadband during hand, tongue, or foot movements using a simple block-design screening task. Subsequently, broadband power in these channels was coupled to continuous movement of a cursor on a screen during both overt movement and kinesthetic imagery. Main results. 26 subjects (29 out of 31 feedback conditions) established successful control, defined as more than 80 percent accuracy, during the overt movement BCI task, while only 12 (of the same 31 conditions) achieved control during the motor imagery BCI task. In successful imagery BCI, broadband power in the reinforced control channel(s) in the two target conditions separated into distinct subpopulations. Outside of the control channel(s), we demonstrate that imagery BCI engages unique subnetworks of the motor system compared to cued movement or kinesthetic imagery alone. Significance. Pericentral sEEG-based motor BCI utilizing overt movement and kinesthetic imagery is robust across a diverse patient cohort with inconsistent accuracy during imagined movement. Cued movement, kinesthetic imagery, and feedback engage the motor network uniquely, providing the opportunity to understand the network dynamics underlying BCI control and improve future BCIs.",

      "title": "Co-Designing Research Priorities in Developmental Neuroscience: A Community-Based Participatory Approach",
      "content": "Children and adolescents, the primary participants in developmental neuroscience research, are rarely consulted or included in the research design process. By neglecting their perspectives and needs, we risk limiting the relevance and effectiveness of translational research that might emerge from such research. Here, we report on a process of co-development with adolescents in the UK city of Bradford to inform the generation of a new developmental neuroimaging research programme. We employed a two-study community-based participatory approach and used mixed methods to identify the research priorities of this community. In the first study, 79 secondary school students from four schools were introduced to fundamental neuroscience concepts during five one-hour workshops. In groups, they then designed research studies, centred around topics they deemed imported, and were asked to present their ideas on posters, role playing as neuroscientists. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on these posters, extracting ten key themes. In the second study, 387 students from four schools ranked the ten extracted themes in order of importance. Mental health and stress consistently emerged as the highest priorities across groups. Exploratory analysis revealed that the priority for themes exploring healthy routines and understanding anti-social behaviours varied across schools and the importance of mental health, and topics related to video gaming varied significantly between genders. This work provides an illustration of how a place-based participatory approach can inform the design of developmental neuroscience programmes, improving both equity and translational relevance.",
