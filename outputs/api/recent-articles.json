      "title": "Passive Brain-Computer Interface Using Textile-Based Electroencephalography",
      "content": "Background: Passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) systems use a combination of electroencephalography (EEG) and machine learning (ML) to evaluate a user's cognitive and physiological state, with increasing applications in both clinical and non-clinical scenarios. pBCI systems have been limited by their traditional reliance on sensor technologies that cannot easily be integrated into non-laboratory settings where pBCIs are most needed. Advances in textile-electrode-based EEG show promise in...",

      "content": "Unimodal brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often suffer from inherent limitations due to the characteristic of using single modalities. While hybrid BCIs combining electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer complementary advantages, effectively integrating their spatiotemporal features remains a challenge due to inherent signal asynchrony. This study aims to develop a novel deep fusion network to achieve synergistic integration of EEG and fNIRS signals...",
