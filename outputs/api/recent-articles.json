      "content": "IntroductionPredictive processing posits that the brain minimizes discrepancies between internal predictions and sensory inputs, offering a unifying account of perception, cognition, and action. In voluntary actions, it is thought to suppress self-generated sensory outcomes. Although sensory mismatch signals have been extensively investigated and modeled, mechanistic insights into the neural computation of predictive processing in voluntary actions remain limited.MethodsWe developed a computational model comprising two-compartment excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and three major types of inhibitory interneurons with biologically realistic connectivity. The model incorporates experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity and feature selectivity to shape excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance. We then extended it to a two-dimensional prediction-error (PE) circuit in which each PC has two segregated, top-down modulated dendrites-each bell-tuned to a distinct feature-enabling combination selectivity.ResultsThe model reveals that top-down predictions can selectively suppress PCs with matching feature selectivity via experience-dependent inhibitory plasticity. This suppression depends on the response selectivity of inhibitory interneurons and on balanced excitation and inhibition across multiple pathways. The framework also accommodates predictions involving two independent features.DiscussionBy combining biological connectivity data with computational modeling, this study provides insights into the neural circuits and computations underlying the active suppression of sensory responses in voluntary actions. These findings contribute to understanding how the brain generates and processes predictions to guide behavior.",

      "title": "When embodiment matters most: a confirmatory study on VR priming in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces training",
      "content": "BackgroundVirtual Reality (VR) feedback is increasingly integrated into Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, enhancing the Sense of Embodiment (SoE) toward virtual avatars and fostering more vivid motor imagery (MI). VR-based MI-BCIs hold promise for motor rehabilitation, but their effectiveness depends on neurofeedback quality. Although SoE may enhance MI training, its role as a priming strategy prior to VR-BCI has not been systematically examined, as prior work assessed embodiment only after interaction. This study investigates whether embodiment priming influences MI-BCI outcomes, focusing on event-related desynchronization (ERD) and BCI performance.MethodsUsing a within-subject design, we combined data from a pilot study with an extended experiment, yielding 39 participants. Each completed an embodiment induction phase followed by MI training with EEG recordings. ERD and lateralization indices were analyzed across conditions to test the effect of prior embodiment.ResultsEmbodiment induction reliably increased SoE, yet no significant ERD differences were found between embodied and control conditions. However, lateralization indices showed greater variability in the embodied condition, suggesting individual differences in integrating embodied feedback.ConclusionOverall, findings indicate that real-time VR-based feedback during training, rather than prior embodiment, is the main driver of MI-BCI performance improvements. These results corroborate earlier findings that real-time rendering of embodied feedback during MI-BCI training constitutes the primary mechanism supporting performance gains, while highlighting the complex role of embodiment in VR-based MI-BCIs.",

      "title": "Precision TMS through the integration of neuroimaging and machine learning: optimizing stimulation targets for personalized treatment",
      "content": "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique based on electromagnetic induction, modulates cortical excitability by inducing currents with a magnetic field. TMS has demonstrated significant clinical potential in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. However, conventional TMS targeting methods that rely on anatomical landmarks do not adequately account for individual differences in brain structure and functional networks, leading to considerable variability in treatment responses. In recent years, advances in neuroimaging techniques\u2013such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\u2013together with the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in big data analysis, have provided novel approaches for precise TMS targeting and individualized treatment. This review summarizes the latest developments in the integration of multimodal neuroimaging and AI technologies for precision neuromodulation with TMS. It focuses on critical issues such as imaging resolution, AI model generalizability, real-time feedback modulation, as well as data privacy and ethical considerations. Future prospects including closed-loop TMS control systems, cross-modal data fusion, and AI-assisted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are also discussed. Overall, AI-driven personalized TMS strategies hold promise for markedly enhancing treatment precision and clinical efficacy, thereby offering new theoretical and practical guidance for individualized treatment in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "GenCPM: a toolbox for generalized connectome-based predictive modeling",
      "content": "Understanding brain\u2014behavior relationships and predicting cognitive and clinical outcomes from neuromarkers are central tasks in neuroscience. Connectome-based Predictive Modeling (CPM) has been widely adopted to predict behavioral traits from brain connectivity data; however, existing implementations are largely restricted to continuous outcomes, often overlook essential non-imaging covariates, and are difficult to apply in clinical or disease cohort settings. To address these limitations, we present GenCPM, a generalized CPM framework implemented in open-source R software. GenCPM extends traditional CPM by supporting binary, categorical, and time-to-event outcomes and allows the integration of covariates such as demographic and genetic information, thereby improving predictive accuracy and interpretability. To handle high-dimensional data, GenCPM incorporates marginal screening and regularized regression techniques, including LASSO, ridge, and elastic net, for efficient selection of informative brain connections. We demonstrate the utility of GenCPM through analyses of the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), showing enhanced predictive performance and improved signal attribution compared to standard methods. GenCPM offers a flexible, scalable, and interpretable solution for predictive modeling in brain connectivity research, supporting broader applications in cognitive and clinical neuroscience.",

      "title": "A novel fast detection algorithm for depression based on 3-channel EEG signals",
      "content": "Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are an emerging field in current research. Among middle-aged and elderly patients, most MUS symptoms are mainly caused by depression, but early symptoms do not meet the international somatization standards, which delays treatment. Therefore, developing a rapid auxiliary diagnosis method is of great significance. This paper proposes a novel model for identifying depression based on 3-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the prefrontal lobe of the human brain. For the collected resting-state EEG signals, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used for signal decomposition, and the power spectrum is employed to select intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. After extracting energy features via sample entropy, LightGBM is adopted for classification, with a classification accuracy of 97.42%. Through comparative experiments, the model proposed in this paper achieves a balance between high accuracy and timeliness. This is conducive to the development of a depression detection system based on portable real-time electroencephalography (EEG), and provides a solution for EEG signal devices in real-time depression detection and pre-triage of patients with Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS).",

      "title": "Analysis of the correlation between serum vitamin D and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hormone levels in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder",
      "content": "ObjectivePost-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a psychological disorder triggered by extreme traumatic events. It is characterized by impaired cognitive function and neuroendocrine dysfunction, particularly dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In recent years, the role of vitamin D in neuroprotection and cognitive function has garnered increasing interest; however, its relationship with hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis hormone levels in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) remains poorly understood.MethodsThis study aimed to investigate the correlation between serum vitamin D levels and HPA axis hormones in patients with PTSD. A total of 96 patients with severe trauma admitted to Rizhao People\u2019s Hospital between March 2022 and December 2024 were enrolled and categorized into PTSD and non-PTSD groups according to diagnostic criteria. PTSD symptoms were evaluated using the PTSD Checklist\u2013Civilian Version. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and cortisol were measured. Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves were employed to assess associations between vitamin D, HPA axis biomarkers, and PCL-C Scores.ResultsThe results showed that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly lower in the PTSD group compared to the non-PTSD group (P < 0.001), while CRH and ACTH levels were significantly higher, and cortisol levels were significantly lower (P < 0.001). Spearman correlation analysis indicated that vitamin D levels were negatively correlated with CRH and ACTH levels and positively correlated with cortisol levels (P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis revealed that serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels have diagnostic potential for PTSD, with a cutoff value of 16.32 ng/mL, an AUC of 0.698, sensitivity of 86.2%, and specificity of 51.1%.ConclusionThis study demonstrated a correlation between serum vitamin D levels and HPA axis hormone levels in patients with PTSD, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with HPA axis dysregulation in PTSD. These findings underscore a potential link between vitamin D deficiency and PTSD, warranting further investigation into the role of vitamin D in the disorder\u2019s pathophysiology and its potential as a therapeutically modifiable factor.",

      "title": "A time-frequency feature fusion-based deep learning network for SSVEP frequency recognition",
      "content": "IntroductionSteady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) has emerged as a pivotal branch in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) due to its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and elevated information transfer rate (ITR). However, substantial inter-subject variability in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals poses a significant challenge to current SSVEP frequency recognition. In particular, it is difficult to achieve high cross-subject classification accuracy in calibration-free scenarios, and the classification performance heavily depends on extensive calibration data.MethodsTo mitigate the reliance on large calibration datasets and enhance cross-subject generalization, we propose SSVEP time-frequency fusion network (SSVEP-TFFNet), an improved deep learning network fusing time-domain and frequency-domain features dynamically. The network comprises two parallel branches: a time-domain branch that ingests raw EEG signals and a frequency-domain branch that processes complex-spectrum features. The two branches extract the time-domain and frequency-domain features, respectively. Subsequently, these features are fused via a dynamic weighting mechanism and input to the classifier. This fusion strategy strengthens the feature expression ability and generalization across different subjects.ResultsCross-subject classification was conducted on publicly available 12-class and 40-class SSVEP datasets. We also compared SSVEP-TFFNet with traditional approaches and principal deep learning methods. Results demonstrate that SSVEP-TFFNet achieves an average classification accuracy of 89.72% on the 12-class dataset, surpassing the best baseline method by 1.83%. SSVEP-TFFNet achieves average classification accuracies of 72.11 and 82.50% (40-class datasets), outperforming the best controlled method by 7.40 and 6.89% separately.DiscussionThe performance validates the efficacy of dynamic time-frequency feature fusion and our proposed method provides a new paradigm for calibration-free SSVEP-based BCI systems.",

      "content": "We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
