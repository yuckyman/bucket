      "title": "Is critical brain dynamics more prevalent than previously thought?",
      "content": "The hypothesis that the brain operates near criticality has far-reaching implications for brain function and is supported by growing experimental evidence. Observations of scale-invariant brain activity agree with this hypothesis, but what about when brain activity is not scale-invariant? Should we reject the criticality hypothesis When power-laws poorly fit the data or when strong oscillations occur (dominated by a specific time scale)? Here we show several ways that criticality can be hidden from traditional data analytic approaches, leading to false negative conclusions. We use a parsimonious high-dimensional model to demonstrate how neural systems may separate different dynamical modes into different subspaces, simultaneously generating non-critical dynamics, critical oscillations, and scale-invariant avalanches. Our results point to a need for new methods capable of revealing hidden criticality and suggest that criticality could be more prevalent than previously thought, hidden in subspaces not readily revealed by standard data analyses.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head.

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy may improve schisis cavity volume in XLRS, with a tolerable safety profile observed in a small number of studies. However, the relatively low single-surgery success rate for XLRS-RD highlights the complex anatomy in these eyes. These findings should be considered when assessing anatomic outcomes from novel therapies that require PPV, including subretinal gene therapy.",

      "content": "Crossmodal correspondences - systematic mappings between stimulus attributes in different modalities - are ubiquitous in the general population. For example, high-pitched (vs low-pitched) sounds are commonly associated with elevated (vs low) positions in space, and rounded (vs angular) shapes tend to be linked to the term 'Bouba' (vs 'Kiki'). There is still some debate about the role of immediate sensory experience versus conceptual colour understanding in crossmodal correspondences. In...",

      "content": "Visual motion perception declines during natural aging in most animals including humans. Edible berries of blackcurrant (BC) and its extracted anthocyanins (BCAs) have beneficial effects on human eyes. However, the effect of BCAs on the perception of moving objects and other dynamic visual patterns remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether BCAs improve visual movement perception in aging mice. The aging mice were fed either a standard diet or a standard diet containing BC....",

While recent large-scale vision models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP offer potential, SAM is trained on natural images, lacking medical domain knowledge, and its decoder struggles with accurate tumor segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose the Medical SAM-Clip Grafting...",

Anemia, which is a widespread condition that affects billions of people worldwide, compromises oxygen transport due to low hemoglobin levels, which leads to severe complications if left undetected. Early and frequent monitoring is essential, yet traditional blood tests can be invasive, costly, and impractical for continuous assessment. This study presents the first...",
