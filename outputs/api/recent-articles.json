      "title": "A Pilot Study on Fabric-Based Pneumatic Soft Gloves for Assisting Patients With Severe Brachial Plexus Injury",
      "content": "Objective: Robotic gloves show promise in hand assistance due to their wearability and home-based potential, yet empirical research remains limited. This pilot study presents a fabric-based pneumatic soft glove, aiming to identify its potential and challenges in clinical practice by evaluating its effectiveness in assisting patients with severe brachial plexus injury (BPI). Methods: The glove integrates a thumb abduction actuator and four bidirectional fabric-based pneumatic actuators (FPAs) with asymmetric chambers for high output force. Sixteen healthy volunteers and five individuals with BPI, all of whom lacked active hand and wrist movements, were recruited. Participants performed object grasping across 25 cm. The healthy group performed seven tasks using objects weighing up to 2 kg, with muscle activities recorded for analysis. The BPI group further performed tasks with eight objects from the action research arm test (ARAT) and twelve objects for activities of daily living (ADLs), encompassing various sizes, weights, and geometries. Results: In the healthy group, sEMG showed a decrease in 89.3% of trials, with 56.0% of these decreases being significant (p$< $0.01). For BPI group, the range of motion (ROM) improved, ranging from 28.5 $\\pm$ 7.9$^{\\circ }$ to 63.1 $\\pm$ 5.1$^{\\circ }$ (thumb) and 10.3 $\\pm$ 17.5$^{\\circ }$ to 122.5 $\\pm$ 19.0$^{\\circ }$ (index finger). With a zero baseline for all tasks, their completion rates were 6.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 out of 8 for ARAT tasks and 10.0 $\\pm$ 1.7 out of 12 for ADLs. Conclusion: The fabric-based pneumatic soft glove significantly enhanced the hand function of patients with severe BPI, demonstrating its potential for hand assistance.",

      "content": "The open-source development model has been successfully applied to consumer and enterprise software, and recently to consumer hardware. Medical devices may become a beneficiary of this trend, as open-source medical device development has the potential to reduce costs, democratize patient access, and provide continued support to abandoned devices from failed companies. Unlike the consumer device market, the medical device market is highly regulated and involves considerable manufacturer liability that may limit the use of open-source technology. This review of open-source medical device development explores the current state of development in research and clinical products and suggests best practices for creating sustainable and effective open-source medical devices.",

      "title": "A Neighbor-Sensitive Multi-Modal Flexible Learning Framework for Improved Prostate Tumor Segmentation in Anisotropic MR Images",
      "content": "Accurate segmentation of prostate tumors from multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, the robustness of existing segmentation methods is limited, mainly because these methods 1) fail to flexibly assess subject-specific information of each MR modality and integrate modality-specific information for accurate tumor delineation, and 2) lack effective utilization of inter-slice information across thick slices in MR images to segment the tumor as a whole 3D volume. In this work, we propose a neighbor-sensitive multi-modal flexible learning network (NesMFle) for accurate prostate tumor segmentation from multi-modal anisotropic MR images. Specifically, we perform multi-modal fusion for each slice by developing a Modality-informativeness Flexible Learning (MFLe) module for selecting and flexibly fusing informative representations of each modality based on inter-modality correlation in a pre-trained manner. After that, we exploit inter-slice feature correlation to derive volumetric tumor segmentation. In particular, we first use a Unet variant equipped with a Sequence Layer, which can coarsely capture slice relationship using 3D convolution and an attention mechanism. Then, we introduce an Activation Mapping Guidance (AMG) module to refine slice-wise representations using information from adjacent slices, ensuring consistent tumor segmentation across neighboring slices based on slice quality assessment on activation maps. Besides, during the network training, we further apply a random mask strategy to each MR modality for improving feature representation efficiency. Experiments on both in-house and public (PICAI) multi-modal prostate tumor datasets demonstrate that our proposed NesMFLe achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

      "title": "Scaffolding Creativity: How Divergent and Convergent LLM Personas Shape Human Machine Creative Problem-Solving",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.26490v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping creative work and problem-solving; however, prior research suggests that they may diminish unassisted creativity. To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona, while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers.\n  Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing. Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model, demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving.\n  Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26265v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values. However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26251v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The appearance of a virtual avatar significantly influences its perceived appropriateness and the user's experience, particularly in healthcare applications. This study analyzed interactions with six avatars of varying characteristics in a patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) application to investigate correlations between avatar ratings and user preferences. Forty-seven participants completed a healthcare survey involving 30 PROMIS items (Global Health and Physical Function) and then rated the avatars on warmth, competence, attractiveness, and human-likeness, as well as their willingness to share personal data. The results showed that competence was the most critical factor in avatar selection, while human-likeness had minimal impact on health data disclosure. Gender did not significantly affect the ratings, but clothing style played a key role, with male avatars in professional attire rated higher in competence due to gender-stereotypical expectations. In contrast, professional female avatars were rated lower in warmth and attractiveness. These findings underline the importance of thoughtful avatar design in healthcare applications to enhance user experience and engagement.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26172v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social media platforms generate massive volumes of heterogeneous data, capturing user behaviors, textual content, temporal dynamics, and network structures. Analyzing such data is crucial for understanding phenomena such as opinion dynamics, community formation, and information diffusion. However, discovering insights from this complex landscape is exploratory, conceptually challenging, and requires expertise in social media mining and visualization. Existing automated approaches, though increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs), remain largely confined to structured tabular data and cannot adequately address the heterogeneity of social media analysis. We present SIA (Social Insight Agents), an LLM agent system that links heterogeneous multi-modal data -- including raw inputs (e.g., text, network, and behavioral data), intermediate outputs, mined analytical results, and visualization artifacts -- through coordinated agent flows. Guided by a bottom-up taxonomy that connects insight types with suitable mining and visualization techniques, SIA enables agents to plan and execute coherent analysis strategies. To ensure multi-modal integration, it incorporates a data coordinator that unifies tabular, textual, and network data into a consistent flow. Its interactive interface provides a transparent workflow where users can trace, validate, and refine the agent's reasoning, supporting both adaptability and trustworthiness. Through expert-centered case studies and quantitative evaluation, we show that SIA effectively discovers diverse and meaningful insights from social media while supporting human-agent collaboration in complex analytical tasks.",

      "title": "Interaction-Augmented Instruction: Modeling the Synergy of Prompts and Interactions in Human-GenAI Collaboration",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.26069v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Text prompt is the most common way for human-generative AI (GenAI) communication. Though convenient, it is challenging to convey fine-grained and referential intent. One promising solution is to combine text prompts with precise GUI interactions, like brushing and clicking. However, there lacks a formal model to model synergistic designs between prompts and interactions, hindering their comparison and innovation. To fill this gap, via an iterative and deductive process, we develop the Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI) model, a compact entity-relation graph formalizing how the combination of interactions and text prompts enhances human-generative AI communication. With the model, we distill twelve recurring and composable atomic interaction paradigms from prior tools, verifying our model's capability to facilitate systematic design characterization and comparison. Case studies further demonstrate the model's utility in applying, refining, and extending these paradigms. These results illustrate our IAI model's descriptive, discriminative, and generative power for shaping future GenAI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.26041v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mindfulness has been studied and practiced in enhancing psychological well-being while reducing neuroticism and psychopathological indicators. However, practicing mindfulness with continuous attention is challenging, especially for beginners. In the proposed system, FractalBrain, we utilize an interactive audiovisual fractal with a geometric repetitive pattern that has been demonstrated to induce meditative effects. FractalBrain presents an experience combining a surreal virtual reality (VR) program with an electroencephalogram (EEG) interface. While viewing an ever-changing fractal-inspired artwork in an immersive environment, the user's EEG stream is analyzed and mapped into VR. These EEG data adaptively manipulates the audiovisual parameters in real-time, generating a distinct experience for each user. The pilot feedback suggests the potential of the FractalBrain to facilitate mindfulness and enhance attention.",

      "title": "Designing for Dignity while Driving: Interaction Needs of Blind and Low-Vision Passengers in Fully Automated Vehicles",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.26015v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) hold promise for enhancing the mobility of blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To understand the situated interaction needs of BLV passengers, we conducted six on-road, and in-lab focus groups with 16 participants, immersing them in real-world driving conditions. Our thematic analysis reveals that BLV participants express a high initial 'faith' in FAVs, but require layered, value-sensitive information during the ride to cultivate trust. The participants' modality preference for voice suggests re-evaluating the role of haptics for BLV users in FAVs. Our findings show the importance of a respectful interaction design in FAVs that both address BLV users' mobility challenges and uphold their dignity. While others have advocated for a dignity lens, our contribution lies in grounding this framework in empirical findings and unpacking what it means to design for dignity in the context of FAVs.",
