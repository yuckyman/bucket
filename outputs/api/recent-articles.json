      "title": "Loss of Fmr1 reorganizes the multi-elemental composition of neural and somatic tissues in Fragile X mice",
      "content": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and results from a genetic mutation which silences the expression of Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP serves various roles regulating cellular protein synthesis and ion flux. However, a comprehensive comparison of multidimensional elemental balance (i.e., ionome) between FXS genotypes and tissues remains absent from the literature. Here, we measured the multivariate balance of 10 elements (i.e., ionome) in tissues of wild-type and Fmr1-knockout mice to compare ionomic composition of brain and somatic tissues within and across genotypes. We found that homogenized brain tissue including several regions (brain PMHTH; define at first use) differed in elemental balance between genotypes, according to MANOVA. We failed to observe differences between genotypes in the mean ratio of any individual element in PMHTH, but sodium displayed lower variance in knockout than wild-type PMHTH. Knockout striatum displayed lower variance in potassium than wild-type. Knockout olfactory bulbs contained higher mean iron and displayed higher variance in sodium and copper than wild-type. Wild-type feces contained higher mean magnesium and zinc than knockout. These results align with previous work showing FXS pathologies alter electrolytic and metal ion regulation, neuronal excitability, and gastrointestinal function. Further work is needed to identify the source of overall ionomic differences in heterogeneous brain tissue (PMHTH), which could be due to differences among regions. Future work should additionally test how elemental differences relate to function at the cellular level, as well as patterns of individual intake, digestion, assimilation, and/or excretion.",

      "title": "D-Methionine Improves Spatial Navigation and Attenuates Oxidative Stress and Amyloid Pathology in a Sex-Specific Manner",
      "content": "Background Oxidative stress and maladaptive neuroimmune activation contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and represent therapeutic targets beyond amyloid-centered approaches. Objective To determine whether oral D-methionine (D-Met), a redox-active amino acid, reduces amyloid pathology and lipid peroxidation and confers disease-modifying benefits in AD mouse models. Methods Male and female APP/PS1 and APPNL-F mice with advanced AD pathology received oral D-Met or vehicle. Behavioral assessments included locomotor activity and hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory. Amyloid burden, lipid peroxidation, peripheral metabolic and inflammatory markers, and hippocampal microglial phenotypes were evaluated using biochemical and histological analyses. Results D-Met did not alter locomotor or exploratory behavior but improved spatial memory recall in both sexes of APP/PS1 mice and in female APPNL-F mice. APPNL-F males exhibited improved learning during Morris water maze (MWM) acquisition. Amyloid pathology was modestly and region-specifically reduced, including decreased hippocampal plaque size in male APPNL-F mice, reduced cortical plaque size in female APP/PS1 mice, and lower soluble amyloid-{beta} (A{beta})42 in male APP/PS1 mice. Lipid peroxidation, assessed by malondialdehyde, was reduced only in female APPNL-F mice. D-Met induced pronounced sex-dependent peripheral effects, increasing adiposity and pro-inflammatory adipose signaling in males, while reducing perigonadal white adipose tissue (pgWAT) IL-6 expression in female APPNL-F mice. In the hippocampus, D-Met remodeled microglial signatures, with female APPNL-F mice showing reduced Iba1 and disease-associated microglial (DAM) markers and increased Axl expression. Conclusion Short-term D-Met acts as a metabolic and redox modulator with modest amyloid-lowering effects mediated by improved microglial function. Therapeutic efficacy is strongly sex- and model-dependent, with the greatest benefit observed in female APPNL-F mice.",

      "title": "Perceptual and neural biomarkers of distraction from an external sound source are not associated with tinnitus severity",
      "content": "Individuals with chronic tinnitus perceive a phantom sound that imposes either a bothersome and irrepressible distraction throughout waking hours or a relatively mild nuisance that often fades into subliminal awareness. The difference in tinnitus salience may reflect a general difference in inhibitory control over any distracting sound, whether externally or internally generated. To test this hypothesis, we investigated neural and behavioral signatures of external auditory distraction suppression in participants with chronic tinnitus that had mild or bothersome tinnitus but were otherwise matched for age and hearing loss. Participants in both groups underwent behavioral and EEG testing that asked them to report on a target stream of amplitude modulated tones that switched from a random arrangement to a repeating sequence. Using additional sounds that imposed varying levels of distraction, we documented neural and perceptual suppression of auditory distractors. Behaviorally, participants with mild versus bothersome tinnitus showed comparable reductions in accuracy in the presence of varying distractor loads. Neural synchronization to the target stimulus change rate provided a useful proxy for distraction effects but did not differ between tinnitus groups. Likewise, no group differences were observed in the neural synchronization to modulation rates of the target or distractor stimuli. Our results build on work showing that individuals with tinnitus perform as well as individuals with normal hearing on listening tasks in noisy environments and expand this observation into the neural representation of sounds. Suppression of the internally generated phantom percept does not appear to be linked to general deficits in suppressing distractors.",

      "title": "Working Memory of Multi-Object Scenes in Primate Frontal Cortex",
      "content": "Working memory allows primates to reason about complex scenes, yet how the brain maintains multiple objects in memory simultaneously remains unclear. Competing theories propose that objects are stored in discrete slots, represented dynamically through switching, or encoded by weighted combinations of single-object representations. We formalized these hypotheses in terms of their quantitative predictions at the level of single neurons and tested them against densely recorded neural data from the dorsomedial frontal cortex and frontal eye field of monkeys trained to perform a novel multi-object working-memory task. Across cross-validated neural data, a Gain model, where population activity reflects weighted compositions of individual object responses, consistently outperformed Slot and Switching models. Trial-specific gain estimates predicted behavioral errors and reaction times, indicating that these latent weights capture meaningful fluctuations in memory fidelity. All results replicated in an independent dataset with different spatial configurations. Together, our work provides a rigorous framework to adjudicate a longstanding debate about how the frontal cortex retains multiple objects, identifying a weighted-sum representation as the format that best explains the neural data.",
