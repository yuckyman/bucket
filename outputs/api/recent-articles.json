      "title": "Olfactory Bulb Pinprick Induction of Cortical Spreading Depolarizations",
      "content": "Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a wave of cellular depolarization followed by prolonged depression of neuronal activity and is associated with a broad array of neurological diseases, including migraine with aura, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. Traditional CSD induction methods for animal studies have included pinprick, concentrated potassium chloride (KCl) application, and electrical stimulation. These methods are invasive and can cause injury to the cortex. Recently, a non-invasive approach using optogenetics has become available, but requires the use of transgenic mice or transfection of an optogene, which limits its wide adoption. Here, we describe a novel approach using olfactory bulb needle insertion in rodents to induce CSD. We also included KCl-induced CSDs as a comparator in the same mice. Olfactory bulb pinprick resulted in CSDs on every attempt (n = 18/18) as confirmed with optical intrinsic signal imaging. Histological analysis revealed that needle disruption in the caudal olfactory bulb, which is continuous with the cerebral cortex, may account for the propagation of CSD from the olfactory bulb to the cortex. Olfactory bulb pinprick reliably induces CSD and is non-invasive with respect to cortex. The approach may prove to be useful in rodent studies where maintenance of cortical integrity is important.",

      "title": "The Rational Irrational: Better Learners Show Stronger Frequency Heuristics",
      "content": "Does favoring less valuable options that deliver more frequent rewards reflect flawed decision-making or an adaptive strategy under complex environments? Frequency effects, defined as a bias toward more frequently rewarded but less valuable options, have traditionally been viewed as maladaptive decision-making deficits. In the present study, we used a within-subject design in which participants completed a four-option reinforcement learning task twice, once under a baseline condition and once with a reward frequency manipulation, to test whether better baseline learning predicts greater or lesser susceptibility to frequency-based biases. Participants were first trained on two fixed option pairs and then transferred their knowledge to novel pairings in a testing phase. Across conditions, higher training accuracy generally predicted higher test accuracy, with one critical exception: on trials where a more valuable option was pitted against a more frequently rewarded but less valuable alternative, participants with higher training accuracy exhibited a stronger bias toward the more frequent option. Moreover, baseline optimal choice rates in these specific trials were unrelated to--and even slightly negatively correlated with--optimal choice rates under the frequency condition. Computational modeling further showed that participants with better baseline learning performance were better fit by frequency-sensitive models in the frequency condition and they weighed frequency-based processing more heavily than value-based processing. Overall, these findings suggest that frequency effects, rather than signaling flawed learning, manifest more strongly in individuals with better baseline learning performance. This seemingly irrational bias may, under conditions of uncertainty, reflect a flexible, adaptive strategy that emerges among the best learners when value-based approaches are costly or unreliable.",

      "title": "Efficient Coding of Spatial Frequency in Natural Images: Cross-frequency Dependence",
      "content": "Research suggests that spatial frequency (SF) channels in the visual system operate with a degree of independence. However, the independence model has been questioned by evidence of non-additive effects in compound gratings, indicating complex interactions between SF channels. These studies, however, typically employ artificial stimuli, leaving questions about SF processing in natural scenes. Efficient Coding hypothesis, which posits that the visual system minimizes redundancy and retains relevant information, predicts a dependence between HSF and LSF. In this study, we examined interactions between LSF and HSF using natural and phase-scrambled images to explore SF integration during perception. Participants completed an SF identification task, using both natural and scrambled images to isolate the role of phase alignment. Our results indicate that HSF and LSF interact primarily in phase-aligned conditions, with phase scrambling driving independent processing of two SFs and reducing error rates. These findings suggest that phase alignment enhances perceptual efficiency, facilitating a trade-off between accuracy and redundancy reduction in natural scene processing.",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
