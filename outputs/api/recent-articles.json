      "title": "Anesthesia-triggered dopaminergic bursts actively induce forgetting: a paradigm shift in understanding cold-shock amnesia",
      "content": "Retrograde memory loss, the inability to recall events preceding amnesia onset, is a well-documented consequence of anesthesia. Recent discoveries, pioneered by Drosophila research, have challenged the view that forgetting is a passive process, and have demonstrated that rather it is a highly active, well-regulated biological process. This work builds on this and makes a remarkable and unexpected discovery that anesthesia itself triggers a robust, widespread burst of activity in dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Here, we report that both cold-shock and CO2 anesthesia elicits strong activation in PAM and PPL1 DAN populations. This calcium activity is accompanied by robust synaptic release of dopamine. Strikingly, pharmacological experiments show that this response is input-driven, as it is completely abolished by Na+ channel blockers and dampened by nAChR antagonists. Using behavioral methods, crucially, we show that anesthesia-induced amnesia can be prevented by blocking activity in PAM and PPL1 neurons during anesthesia. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized active mechanism by which anesthesia induces forgetting, mediated by rapid dopaminergic signaling. This paradigm-shifting discovery redefines how we think about anesthesia-induced amnesia and the biology of forgetting.",

      "title": "Neuronal recordings in head-fixed and freely-moving mole-rats",
      "content": "Mole-rats are subterranean rodents that have evolved remarkable sensory adaptations to life in underground tunnel systems, yet their neural mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a protocol for in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake, head-fixed, and freely moving African mole-rats (Fukomys anselli/micklemi), overcoming unique challenges of studying the neurobiology of subterranean species. We find that mole-rat brain physiology impacts survival after surgeries, with higher carbon dioxide concentrations required for recovery compared to other rodents, likely due to a mutation in the chloride-potassium symporter KCC2. Having addressed these challenges through our optimized methodology, we used tetrodes and Neuropixels probes to record single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) across several cortical and subcortical regions for several weeks. We observed single units responsive to auditory and visual stimuli in the superior colliculus, and hippocampal recordings in freely moving mole-rats revealed prominent theta rhythms at frequencies lower than those observed in any other rodent species to date. Finally, we performed integrated three-dimensional and two-dimensional probe-track analysis within the same brain using tissue clearing, light sheet imaging, rehydration, and vibratome sectioning, and we present a newly developed stereotaxic brain atlas for implantation and histological alignment. This established methodology will guide future studies in comparative rodent neurobiology, providing further insights into neurobiological adaptations to subterranean environments. Given their phylogenetic and ecological similarities, we expect our protocols to be transferable to other subterranean species, including the widely studied naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber).",

      "title": "Unpredictable chronic stress does not alter social behavior in zebrafish",
      "content": "Stress-related disorders encompass diverse behavioral alterations, including impaired social functioning. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for studying these phenomena, particularly because of its robust and ethologically conserved social behaviors. Unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) produces behavioral, physiological, and molecular changes in zebrafish that parallel core features of human anxiety and depressive disorders; however, its impact on social outcomes remains unclear. Here, we examined whether a 14-day UCS protocol alters social behavior in adult zebrafish using two complementary assays: the social preference test and the shoal cohesion test. Across two independent experiments, UCS did not elicit detectable changes in individual social approach or group-level cohesion. In contrast, UCS induced clear anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test, validating the stress manipulation, with stressed fish displaying reduced vertical exploration and decreased time in the upper zone. Shoal cohesion measures showed a time-dependent decrease in both groups, consistent with habituation to the testing environment rather than a stress-specific effect. Together, these results suggest that social behavior in adult zebrafish is relatively resilient to UCS under the conditions tested, whereas anxiety-like responses are markedly affected. Future work should investigate whether factors such as stressor intensity, developmental stage, sex composition, or social hierarchy modulate the sensitivity of social behavior to chronic stress.",

      "title": "Targeting Putrescine Homeostasis with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PS128 to Mitigate Autism-like Behaviors in Fmr1 KO Mice",
      "content": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often presents with gastrointestinal disturbances, yet the molecular mechanisms linking gut alterations to behavioral dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Using Fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout mice, we found that autism-like behaviors are associated with disrupted gut microbiota-polyamine metabolism and elevated putrescine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Supplementation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PS128 reshaped gut microbial communities, improved intestinal integrity, and restored arginine-ornithine-polyamine metabolic homeostasis. PS128 normalized the serum-to-PFC putrescine imbalance and reduced expression of putrescine transporters in the PFC. Consistent with a causal role, peripheral putrescine elevation induced autism-like behaviors in wild-type mice, whereas inhibition of putrescine synthesis ameliorated behavioral deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice. Together, these findings identify putrescine dysregulation as an important metabolic contributor to autism-like phenotypes, support a metabolically stratifiable ASD subtype, and implicate PS128 as a psychobiotic intervention acting through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

      "content": "The endothelial glycocalyx is a key regulator of cerebrovascular function and remains one of the most difficult structures to study in vivo. Here we uncover new structural and dynamical features of the brain endothelial glycocalyx using in vivo two-photon microscopy. We identified glycocalyx enrichment at endothelial junctions and arteriolar branch points, visualized its vesicular transport in real-time, and found evidence for its compositional variations along the arteriovenous axis. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed two distinct kinetics of wheat germ agglutinin binding, including a previously undescribed one. Finally, super-localization of the glycocalyx estimated glycocalyx thickness as 775{+/-}17 nm and 622{+/-}34 nm before and after enzymatic shedding, reconciling discrepancies between past optical and electron microscopy estimates. Together these findings establish the first milti-scale framework of glycocalyx distribution and heterogeneity, transport, and molecular interaction kinetics in the living brain.",

      "title": "Implicit adaptations effect on sensorimotor and motor confidence",
      "content": "Sensorimotor adaptation maintains movement accuracy by counteracting perturbations or miscalibrations. It can operate explicitly, by consciously adjusting motor plans to correct errors, or implicitly, by automatically recalibrating sensorimotor mappings without altering the motor plan. While explicit adaptation is known to reduce sensorimotor confidence -- the perceived likelihood of successful action -- it is unclear whether implicit adaptation similarly affects confidence in sensorimotor judgments or motor awareness (knowledge of one's own limb position). To investigate this, participants made reaching movements to visual targets without seeing their hand. Cursor feedback followed an '' error-clamped '' trajectory: its radial position matched the hand, but its angular direction was fixed and independent of actual hand direction, a manipulation participants were told to ignore. The clamp direction varied sinusoidally over trials ({+/-} 10 {degrees} ; 12 cycles per session). Participants reported confidence by adjusting the size of an arc centered on the target or, in another task, centered on reported reach direction; larger arcs indicated lower confidence. Points were awarded when the arc encompassed the true reach direction, with fewer points for larger arcs, encouraging accurate and meaningful confidence reports. Fourier analysis of reach and report time series revealed a strong 12-cycle component in both, demonstrating robust implicit adaptation and corresponding changes in motor awareness. These findings indicate that although implicit adaptation operates unconsciously, the resulting mismatch between motor plans and proprioceptive signals can bias judgments of reach outcomes. However, confidence judgments were not consistently affected, suggesting that sensorimotor confidence and confidence in proprioceptive awareness may rely on partially distinct mechanisms.",

      "title": "Progressive muscle metabolic reprogramming in asymptomatic ALS gene mutation carriers",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron loss leading to extensive paralysis. There is emerging evidence that the disease involves a prolonged presymptomatic period during which motor function is preserved. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved is key as the presymptomatic phase represents a critical window of opportunity for early intervention. Using RNA sequencing, we investigated changes in gene expression patterns in the skeletal muscle of ten asymptomatic carriers of ALS mutations (8 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 2 SOD1 mutation carriers). We found that specific modifications of gene expression profiles are present in skeletal muscle before asymptomatic ALS gene carriers exhibit biomarker changes predictive of phenoconversion. We identified insulin signaling, AMPK signaling, and thermogenesis pathways, together with the TCA cycle as the main contributors to the dysregulated muscle transcriptome. Our data suggest that this metabolic reprogramming of skeletal muscle develops progressively during the transition to phenoconversion, characterized by a gradual increase in the expression of SREBF1 which encodes SREPB1, the key transcriptional regulator of lipid synthesis, in parallel with the progressive activation of AMPK and insulin signaling pathways. Our findings are consistent with a progressive enhancement in fatty acid metabolism and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, followed by a decline in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency as phenoconversion approaches. Evidence of muscle metabolic reprogramming in ALS long before motor onset identifies the dysregulation of muscle energy homeostasis as a critical early event in ALS pathogenesis.",

      "title": "Echoes as Signal, Not Noise: Reverberation Sharpens Sensitivity to Temporal Structure",
      "content": "Sensitivity to temporal structure is fundamental to hearing, yet how natural reverberation shapes this sensitivity is unclear. Here we identify a general principle we term echo-facilitated temporal sensitivity (EFTS), in which the auditory system exploits reverberation as a computational resource to selectively and dose dependently enhance perceptual and neural responses to rapid temporal changes. Using transitional click trains with subtle inter click interval (ICI) shifts, human listeners showed monotonically improved change detection across simulated echo levels. Concurrent EEG revealed systematic increases of a late change response with echo strength, while onset responses remained stable, indicating a selective boost to temporal-structure-transition processing. In awake rats, electrocorticography over auditory cortex replicated these effects; single units exhibited echo level dependent increases in ICI transition evoked firing, and receiver operating characteristic neurometrics yielded steeper functions and lower discrimination thresholds. Laminar local field potential analysis further revealed that echo-dependent divergence emerged last in the supragranular layer, after appearing in the granular and infragranular layers, consistent with an initial thalamocortical drive followed by intracortical amplification. Together, these findings establish EFTS as a cross-species mechanism for ecologically grounded temporal computation, through which reverberation sharpens neural representations of temporal structure and enhances sensitivity to rapid pattern changes, reframing echoes as structured signals that the brain uses to naturally optimize temporal integration in everyday listening.",

      "title": "Infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) modulation of human brain pulsations in awake and sleep states",
      "content": "Human brain exhibits three propagating pulsations, namely cardiovascular, respiratory, and vasomotor waves, which together propel the flow of intracranial fluids. While their pulsation characteristics have been extensively studied, their causal interconnections have not been systematically investigated. Using ultrafast whole brain magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), we analysed the frequency domain up to 5 Hz for cross-frequency oscillatory interactions in awake and NREM-sleep states of 23 healthy volunteers. Using transfer entropy (TE) analysis, we found that in the awake state the infra-slow (ISF < 0.1 Hz) oscillations of statistically independent resting state networks (RSN) largely drove the neurofluid (NF) pulsatility. NREM-sleep was associated with increased power of infra-slow fluctuation (ISF) vasomotor oscillations and with altered driving patterns between RSN and NF networks in the direction of a causally chained pattern. Importantly, within these independent signal sources, we found three distinct cross-frequency coupling frequency ranges occurring at ISF (<0.1 Hz), respiratory (~0.25 Hz), and cardiovascular (~1 Hz) frequencies, where the slower pulsations generally modulated the faster ones, except for a finding of inverted cardiorespiratory drive in NREM-2 sleep. These results indicate the presence of directional ISF-coordinated mechanisms underlying brain pulsations that contribute to driving the intracranial fluid transfer processes.",
