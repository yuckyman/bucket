      "title": "A synaptic locus of song learning",
      "content": "Learning by imitation is the foundation for verbal and musical expression, but its underlying neural basis remains obscure. A juvenile male zebra finch imitates the multisyllabic song of an adult tutor in a process that depends on a song-specialized cortico-basal ganglia circuit, affording a powerful system to identify the synaptic substrates of imitative motor learning. Plasticity at a particular set of cortico-basal ganglia synapses is hypothesized to drive rapid learning-related changes in song before these changes are subsequently consolidated in downstream circuits. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is untested and the synaptic locus where learning initially occurs is unknown. By combining a computational framework to quantify song learning with synapse-specific optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations within and directly downstream of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, we identified the specific cortico-basal ganglia synapses that drive the acquisition and expression of rapid vocal changes during juvenile song learning and characterized the hours-long timescale over which these changes consolidate. Furthermore, transiently augmenting postsynaptic activity in the basal ganglia briefly accelerates learning rates and persistently alters song, demonstrating a direct link between basal ganglia activity and rapid learning. These results localize the specific cortico-basal ganglia synapses that enable a juvenile songbird to learn to sing and reveal the circuit logic and behavioral timescales of this imitative learning paradigm.",

      "title": "A dendrite-resolved, in vivo transfer function from spike patterns to dendritic Ca2+",
      "content": "Dendrites transform local electrical activity into intracellular Ca2+ signals that drive plasticity [1,2], yet the voltage [-&gt;] Ca2+ mapping during natural behavior remains poorly defined. Here, we measure this transfer function via simultaneous voltage and Ca2+ imaging throughout the dendritic arbors of hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons in behaving mice. Dendritic Ca2+ exhibited a hierarchical activation pattern dominated by back-propagating action potentials: simple spikes primarily drove somatic and proximal Ca2+, whereas complex spikes produced larger somatic Ca2+ signals and propagated farther into distal dendrites, sometimes in a branch-selective manner. Dendrite-restricted co-activation of voltage and Ca2+ without concurrent somatic events was rare. A biophysics-inspired model accurately predicted local Ca2+ transients from local voltage waveforms. Our data and model provide a quantitative understanding of when -- and why -- dendritic Ca2+ signals in CA2 pyramidal cells arise during behavior.",

      "content": "<p>I made this for myself, and it seemed like it might be useful to others. I'd love some feedback, both on the threat model and the tool itself. I hope you find it useful!<p>Backstory: I've been using many agents in parallel as I work on a somewhat ambitious financial analysis tool. I was juggling agents working on epics for the linear solver, the persistence layer, the front-end, and planning for the second-generation solver. I was losing my mind playing whack-a-mole with the permission prompts. YOLO mode felt so tempting. And yet.<p>Then it occurred to me: what if YOLO mode isn't so bad? Decision fatigue is a thing. If I could cap the blast radius of a confused agent, maybe I could just review once. Wouldn't that be safer?<p>So that day, while my kids were taking a nap, I decided to see if I could put YOLO-mode Claude inside a sandbox that blocks exfiltration and regulates git access. The result is yolo-cage.<p>Also: the AI wrote its own containment system from inside the system's own prototype. Which is either very aligned or very meta, depending on how you look at it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706796\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706796</a></p>\n<p>Points: 18</p>\n<p># Comments: 24</p>",

      "title": "Effectiveness of transcranial electrical stimulation combined with dual-task training in stroke, mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson\u2019s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
      "content": "AimIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) or transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) combined with dual task training (DTT) on physical and cognitive functions in adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and stroke disorders.MethodWe conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and CINAHL databases for English-language literature on randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the effects of tDCS, tACS, or tRNS combined with DTT in adults with MCI, PD, and stroke. The search covered studies from the inception of each database up to November 21, 2025. The initial screening of selected articles was conducted independently by two researchers (YLQ and WLW).ResultsA total of twelve studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising individuals with stroke (n\u202f=\u202f4), MCI (n\u202f=\u202f3), and PD (n\u202f=\u202f5). Meta-analysis revealed that active tDCS+DTT yielded no significant overall improvement in global cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): SMD\u202f=\u202f0.09, 95% CI [\u22120.49, 0.66], p =\u202f0.77, I2 =\u202f72%). A large, highly homogeneous benefit was observed for executive function (TMT-B: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.33, 95% CI [\u22122.39, \u22120.27], p =\u202f0.01), driven exclusively by the MCI subgroup (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22122.35, 95% CI [\u22123.20, \u22121.51], I2 =\u202f0%). Timed Up and Go cognitive-motor dual-task (TUG CMDT) cadence improved overall (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.58, 95% CI [0.09, 1.08], p =\u202f0.02, I2 =\u202f39%) in both MCI and stroke subgroups. TUG motor dual task (MDT) speed improved modestly (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.42, 95% CI [0.02, 0.83], p =\u202f0.04, I2 =\u202f34%), and CMDT speed showed a strong trend (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.49, p =\u202f0.09), only significant in stroke (SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22121.42, p =\u202f0.002). However, this generalized finding must be nuanced by specific efficacy observed in individual PD studies, which reported significant gains in force-tremor decoupling, postural stability, and CMDT accuracy.ConclusionThe meta-analysis suggests that the effects of tDCS combined with DTT are remarkable in certain populations and for specific outcomes. While substantial improvements are confirmed for executive function and dual-task gait in MCI and stroke, the overall limited efficacy in PD highlights the critical influence of heterogeneity and intervention specificity. Future research should prioritize disease-specific electrode montages and the integration of tACS or tRNS to optimize outcomes across diverse neurological populations.",
