However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "title": "Efficacy of Contact Lens-Based Interventions in Slowing Myopia Progression in Children: A Systematic Review",
      "content": "Myopia prevalence is increasing globally, with early-onset childhood myopia carrying a higher risk of progression to high myopia and associated sight-threatening complications. Contact lens-based interventions, including dual-focus, multifocal, extended depth-of-focus (EDOF), and orthokeratology designs, have been developed to slow progression, but their efficacy and safety remain variably reported. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of contact lens interventions in...",

      "content": "In presentations for teaching, research, or public education purposes, well-chosen images enhance focus, reflection, and memory retention. AI tools help create images that are culturally sensitive and inclusive and depict abstract or complex psychiatric scenarios. AI images should be clear, audience-tailored, and complementary to text and verbal explanations. Clear, detailed prompts ensure alignment with the intended vision and stylistic consistency across images. Addressing variables such as...",
