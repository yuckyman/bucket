It is becoming increasingly recognized that mechanical stimuli, such as fluid shear forces, are a critical determinant of immune cell regulation. In this review, we discuss the principles and significance of various mechanical forces present within the human body, with a focus on fluid shear flow and its impact on immune cell activation and function. Moreover, we discuss engineering approaches used to study immune cell mechanobiology, and their implications in health and diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious disease.",

      "title": "Predicting individual incubation of opioid craving by whole-brain functional connectivity",
      "content": "A high risk of relapse triggered by craving during abstinence remains a main challenge in opioid addiction treatment. Multiple brain regions have been implicated in opioid craving, but the brain-wide neural mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Using resting-state fMRI and connectome-based predictive modeling, we identified a whole-brain connectome that predicted the time-dependent increases (incubation) in oxycodone craving in individual rats after voluntary abstinence induced by exposure to an electric barrier. Incubation of oxycodone craving was operationally defined as the increase in non-reinforced lever pressing during relapse tests from early (day 1) to late (day 15) abstinence (incubation score). We found that changes in whole-brain functional connectivity during abstinence, but not during oxycodone self-administration, predicted the incubation score. Greater decreases in functional connectivity were associated with higher incubation scores. The predictive connectome involved complex interactions across multiple brain systems, including frontal-striatal, frontal-insula, insula-striatal, and hippocampal and sensorimotor circuits. To test causality of the predictive connectome, we examined the effect of pharmacological inactivation of dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which significantly decreased oxycodone seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence. DMS inactivation increased connectivity strength within the predictive connectome, supporting a causal role of this connectome in incubation of oxycodone craving. The predictive connectome did not predict food-reward seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence, indicating specificity to oxycodone craving. Our findings identify a brain-wide connectome marker that predicts individual differences in the incubation of opioid craving and provide potential targets for developing personalized interventions and monitoring therapeutic outcomes in opioid addiction treatment.",

      "title": "A method for the time-frequency analysis of high-order interactions in non-stationary physiological networks",
      "content": "Objective. Several data-driven approaches based on information theory have been proposed for analyzing high-order interactions (HOIs) involving three or more components of a network system. The existing methods do not account for temporal correlations in the data, or are defined only in the time domain and rely on the assumption of stationarity in the underlying dynamics, making them inherently unable to detect frequency-specific behaviors and track transient functional links in physiological networks. Approach. This study introduces a new framework which enables the time-varying and time-frequency analysis of HOIs in networks of random processes through the spectral representation of vector autoregressive models. The time- and frequency-resolved analysis of synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes is ensured by a robust identification procedure based on a recursive least squares estimator with a forgetting factor. Main results. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the time-frequency analysis is able to highlight transient synergistic behaviors emerging in specific frequency bands which cannot be detected by time-domain stationary analyzes. The application on brain evoked potentials in rats elicits the presence of redundant information timed with whisker stimulation and mostly occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. The application to cardiovascular oscillations reveals a reduction in redundant information following head-up tilt, reflecting a functional disconnection within the physiological network of heart period, respiratory, and arterial pressure signals. Significance. The proposed framework enables a comprehensive time-varying and time-frequency analysis of the hierarchical organization of dynamic networks. As our approach goes beyond pairwise interactions, it is well suited for the study of transient high-order behaviors arising during state transitions in many network systems commonly studied in physiology, neuroscience and other fields.",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

This paper is meant as a history of how the standard has developed and grown over time. We outline the principles behind the project, the mechanisms by which it has been extended, and some of the challenges being addressed as it evolves. We also discuss the lessons learned through the project, with the aim of enabling researchers in...",
