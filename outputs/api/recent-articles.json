      "title": "Tactile\u2013Thermal Interactions: Cooperation and Competition",
      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "content": "<p>People always want to know what the point of life is. Why are they on earth? What are we doing here? Whats our purpose? <em>Whats the point?</em></p>\n<p>For most of my life, I didn't really have any answer, but as I got older, I realized, things weren't about me. I took a step back, and recognized a much bigger picture we're all apart of, and I now know exactly why we're here on earth.</p>\n<p>As a human, you have a powerful ability, to calm, heal, and help those around you. You have the ability to protect both the people in our world, and the planet itself from harm and distress.</p>\n<p>I know there is a huge amount of pain in our world, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness, and believe me when I say, I share the same feelings. However I believe its important that we each learn to <em><strong>harness that energy into things that are positive and kind</strong></em>, not negative or evil.</p>\n<p>Remember that a lot of who you are, is your ability to experience things outside of yourself, <em>including other humans.</em> They are a direct and immediate part of your own reality. Treat their struggles and woes as if they were your own, don't leave people behind, don't leave people unloved. As frustrating as the world can be, it is worth protecting, it is worth loving, it is worth healing together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;Life is a beautiful, magnificent thing, even to a jellyfish... The trouble is you won't fight. You've given in, continually dwelling on sickness and death. But there's something just as inevitable as death, and that's life. Life, life, life. Think of all the power that's in the universe, moving the earth, growing the trees. That's the same power within you if you only have the courage and the will to use it.&quot;</em> - Charlie Chaplin, Limelight 1952</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>&quot;The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings; for that reason, he does not hate anyone.&quot;</em> - Isa Upanishad</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "\ud83d\ude80 Introducing MacToast: Modern, customizable toast notifications for MacOS!",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p><strong>mactoast</strong> is a small Python library that displays clean, modern toast-style notifications on macOS. It aims to provide an easy way for scripts, tools, automations, and CLI apps to give lightweight visual feedback\u2014without relying on full macOS Notification Center alerts. Key features:</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udfe6 Minimal, borderless toast UI (color, size, transparency customizable)</li> <li>\u26a1 One-line usage \u2014 <code>toast(&quot;Hello&quot;)</code></li> <li>\u2611\ufe0f Display SF Symbols and icons</li> <li>\ud83d\udd00 Non-blocking mode so your script keeps running while the toast appears</li> <li>\ud83d\udd14 Various notification sounds</li> <li>\ud83c\udf4e MacOS-native window</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s designed to feel like the lightweight snackbars you see in modern UIs\u2014simple and unobtrusive. I was inspired by Raycast's compact output for command scripts. Link: <a href=\"https://github.com/rafa-rrayes/mactoast\">https://github.com/rafa-rrayes/mactoast</a></p> <p>To install it: <code>pip install mactoast</code></p> <p>Usage:</p> <pre><code>import mactoast mactoast.toast(&quot;hello world!&quot;) </code></pre> <p>Its that easy!</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>mactoast is intended for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Developers working on macOS</strong> who want simple, lightweight feedback from scripts or tools</li> <li><strong>CLI/terminal users</strong> who want visual cues without printing more text</li> <li><strong>Automation workflows</strong> (e.g., cron jobs, personal scripts) that need a small \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cerror\u201d popup</li> <li><strong>Prototype and hobby projects</strong>, though the library is stable enough to be used in small production utilities It is <strong>not</strong> designed to replace macOS system notifications or handle interactive/clickable alerts. Its focus is purely aesthetic, quick visual feedback.</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>Existing options for Python notifications on macOS tend to fall into two categories:</p> <h1>1. System-level notifications (e.g., osascript, pync)</h1> <p>These integrate with the macOS Notification Center. They\u2019re great for long-lived, system-tracked alerts\u2014but:</p> <ul> <li>They require user permission</li> <li>They appear in Notification Center clutter</li> <li>They don\u2019t support custom UI styling</li> <li>They can be slow to display <em>mactoast</em> avoids all of that by using a lightweight custom toast window that appears instantly and disappears cleanly.</li> </ul> <h1>2. GUI frameworks (Tkinter, PyQt, etc.)</h1> <p>You <em>can</em> build custom popups with them, but they:</p> <ul> <li>Require full GUI framework dependencies</li> <li>Aren\u2019t visually consistent with macOS</li> <li>Need more code just to show a tiny message <em>mactoast</em> provides a prebuilt, macOS-native toast that requires <strong>zero GUI setup</strong>.</li> </ul> <h1>How mactoast differs</h1> <ul> <li>\ud83c\udf4f macOS-native window, no external GUI frameworks</li> <li>\ud83c\udfa8 Highly customizable (shape, color, duration, font, position)</li> <li>\u26a1 Extremely lightweight, minimal dependencies</li> <li>\ud83e\uddf1 Dead simple API, built specifically for quick notifications</li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rafa_rrayes\"> /u/rafa_rrayes </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmlq1r/introducing_mactoast_modern_customizable_toast/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pmlq1r/introducing_mactoast_modern_customizable_toast/\">[comments]</a></span>",
