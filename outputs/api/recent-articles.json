      "title": "The Reel Deal: Designing and Evaluating LLM-Generated Short-Form Educational Videos",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.05962v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Short-form videos are gaining popularity in education due to their concise and accessible format that enables microlearning. Yet, most of these videos are manually created. Even for those automatically generated using artificial intelligence (AI), it is not well understood whether or how they affect learning outcomes, user experience, and trust. To address this gap, we developed ReelsEd, which is a web-based system that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate structured short-form video (i.e., reels) from lecture long-form videos while preserving instructor-authored material. In a between-subject user study with 62 university students, we evaluated ReelsEd and demonstrated that it outperformed traditional long-form videos in engagement, quiz performance, and task efficiency without increasing cognitive load. Learners expressed high trust in our system and valued its clarity, usefulness, and ease of navigation. Our findings point to new design opportunities for integrating generative AI into educational tools that prioritize usability, learner agency, and pedagogical alignment.",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Fully endoscopic MVD for HFS offers wide visualization of the neurovascular conflict area and minimizes brain injury caused by retraction. Once technical proficiency is achieved, surgical outcomes are favorable and complications are low. Despite the drawbacks such as a slight sense of vertigo during use and high cost, the 3D endoscope provides a stereoscopic view. More research is essential to verify its role in MVD surgery.",

While ocular screening of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine is important, retinal toxicity with a low dose and short duration of use remains rare. Clinicians must retain a broad differential diagnosis in the assessment of patients with bull's eye maculopathy.",

      "content": "Image deblurring and compression-artifact removal are both ill-posed inverse problems in low-level vision tasks. So far, although numerous image deblurring and compression-artifact removal methods have been proposed respectively, the research for explicit handling blur and compression-artifact coexisting degradation image (BCDI) is rare. In the BCDI, image contents will be damaged more seriously, especially for edges and texture details. Therefore, the restoration of the BCDI is a more severe...",

It has been proposed as an alternative to genotyping by SNP arrays. At least one commercial product based on it is available for agricultural species. Concerns limiting adoption in its current form are: 1) the cost of storing the huge volume of data...",
