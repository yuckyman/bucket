      "title": "Ask HN: By what percentage has AI changed your output as a software engineer?",
      "content": "<p>Compared to the era before AI coding tools (say, ~2 years ago), if you had to put a number on it, how much has your productivity as a SWE changed?<p>I think about this a lot; am keen to hear what others' perceptions are. For me; the short answer: about 2x (i.e. 100% faster than pre LLMs). Long answer:<p>When I thoroughly understand the domain (i.e. business logic and real world problem I'm solving), and am familiar with the tech stack, I'm about ~10x faster for the same or better code quality.<p>When I don't understand the domain, prompts will be ambiguous or inadequate, the LLM will guess, it will do a month's work in a day, but I'll spend the next 3 weeks refactoring and realising how trash the code was, due to how trash the prompt was. All in all, it's probably still faster than pre AI, but can give a demoralising psychological phenomena where you <i>think</i> something's nearly completed only to spend weeks debugging it, refactoring, and often tossing it away and starting over.<p>In an unfamiliar tech stack, I can't always spot obvious mistakes (mistakes caused by the AI or the prompt), so it's less productive and more risky.<p>10-15% of the productivity improvement is due to improvements in the dev environment. I open ~/dotfiles with cursor and tell it a problem I have or ask for a specific improvement. It usually modifies .zshrc, .vimrc or similar (and iterates as necessary if the first attempt didn't work). Due to how fast this is (e.g. 5 minutes), I've made about 20 little tweaks that previously didn't justify the time. They definitely make me happier as well as a bit more productive.<p>But overall, taking everything into account, I'd say I'm about 2x as productive as before LLMs.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46409375\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46409375</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 12</p>",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Topological data analysis reveals rigid brain-state dynamics during self-viewing in trait rumination",
      "content": "Rumination -- repetitive, negatively valenced, self-focused thought -- is a maladaptive cognitive style linked to emotional dysregulation and psychiatric risk. To investigate its neural underpinnings in a naturalistic context, we developed an fMRI paradigm in which participants observed and reflected on videos of their own past group-based problem-solving sessions, a naturalistic self-relevant context rarely examined in fMRI studies. Thirty-two adults were recorded during collaborative design-thinking tasks in triads. In a subsequent scanning session, each participant viewed two self-relevant team videos and one control team video, followed by a structured reflection period. We assessed trait rumination using the Rumination Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ) and applied Topological Data Analysis (TDA) via the Mapper algorithm to model individual-level whole-brain dynamics during the task. Mapper shape graphs captured temporal transitions between brain states, allowing us to quantify the similarity of timepoints across the session. Individuals with higher trait rumination showed significantly higher temporal similarity, indicating reduced brain-state variability, during self-relevant conditions (r = 0.46, p = 0.018). This effect was not observed during the control condition. These findings suggest that rumination is associated with rigid brain dynamics during self-observation and evaluative processing. Traditional GLM and inter-subject correlation (ISC) analyses confirmed task engagement of key self-referential and social-evaluative regions, while Mapper revealed dynamic features not captured by static or group-averaged methods. Together, these findings demonstrate that trait rumination is associated with rigid large-scale brain dynamics during self-relevant cognition and highlight the value of combining naturalistic paradigms with topological approaches to capture behaviorally meaningful signatures.",
