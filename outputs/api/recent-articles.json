      "title": "An Approach to Grounding AI Model Evaluations in Human-derived Criteria",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.04676v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria, aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors. Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills, such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.",

      "title": "Combine Virtual Reality and Machine-Learning to Identify the Presence of Dyslexia: A Cross-Linguistic Approach",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.04510v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish university students. In particular, the research investigates whether VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test, but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia, particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.",

      "title": "Conversational AI increases political knowledge as effectively as self-directed internet search",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.05219v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Conversational AI systems are increasingly being used in place of traditional search engines to help users complete information-seeking tasks. This has raised concerns in the political domain, where biased or hallucinated outputs could misinform voters or distort public opinion. However, in spite of these concerns, the extent to which conversational AI is used for political information-seeking, as well the potential impact of this use on users' political knowledge, remains uncertain. Here, we address these questions: First, in a representative national survey of the UK public (N = 2,499), we find that in the week before the 2024 election as many as 32% of chatbot users - and 13% of eligible UK voters - have used conversational AI to seek political information relevant to their electoral choice. Second, in a series of randomised controlled trials (N = 2,858 total) we find that across issues, models, and prompting strategies, conversations with AI increase political knowledge (increase belief in true information and decrease belief in misinformation) to the same extent as self-directed internet search. Taken together, our results suggest that although people in the UK are increasingly turning to conversational AI for information about politics, this shift may not lead to increased public belief in political misinformation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05166v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Many transport authorities are collecting and publishing almost real-time road traffic data to meet the growing trend of massive open data, a vital resource for foresight decision support systems considering deep data insights. Using such a traffic count dataset, we explored the spatio-temporal transitions in the cross-country road traffic volumes in the context of modelling behavioural transitions in car-based human mobility. We developed a reproducible workflow for computing multi-dimensional variables of traffic flow. This study reports on individual car-based daily travel behaviour detected, before (2016-2018) and during the COVID pandemic (2019-2021), between Germany and neighbouring countries (Luxembourg, France and Belgium). In relevance to the net-zero carbon transition, further study should shed light on the interpolation and downscaling approaches at the comprehensive road-network level for identifying pollution hot spots, causal link to functional landuse patterns and calculation of spatial influence area. In the case of Luxembourg, the Bridges and Roads Authority has installed a large digital traffic observatory infrastructure through the adoption of sensor-based IoT technologies, like other European member states. Since 2016, they have provided high-performance data processing and published open data on the country's road traffic. The dataset contains an hourly traffic count for different vehicle types, daily for representative observation points, followed by a major road network. The original dataset contains significant missing entries, so comprehensive data harmonization was performed.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05145v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped by users and contexts.",

In spite of what marketing suggests, research still lacks an understanding of the long-term usage of such devices in ecologically valid everyday settings, as most studies are conducted in very controlled environments. Therefore, we conducted interviews with ten AVP users to better understand how experienced users engage with the device, and which limitations persist. Our participants report that XR can increase productivity and that they got used to the device after some time. Yet, a range of limitations persist that might hinder the widespread use of XR as a productivity tool, such as a lack of native applications, difficulties when integrating XR into current workflows, and limited possibilities to adapt and customize the XR experience.",

      "title": "Evaluating Idle Animation Believability: a User Perspective",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.05023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Animating realistic avatars requires using high quality animations for every possible state the avatar can be in. This includes actions like walking or running, but also subtle movements that convey emotions and personality. Idle animations, such as standing, breathing or looking around, are crucial for realism and believability. In games and virtual applications, these are often handcrafted or recorded with actors, but this is costly. Furthermore, recording realistic idle animations can be very complex, because the actor must not know they are being recorded in order to make genuine movements. For this reasons idle animation datasets are not widely available. Nevertheless, this paper concludes that both acted and genuine idle animations are perceived as real, and that users are not able to distinguish between them. It also states that handmade and recorded idle animations are perceived differently. These two conclusions mean that recording idle animations should be easier than it is thought to be, meaning that actors can be specifically told to act the movements, significantly simplifying the recording process. These conclusions should help future efforts to record idle animation datasets. Finally, we also publish ReActIdle, a 3 dimensional idle animation dataset containing both real and acted idle motions.",

SePA combines: (1) Individualized models predicting daily stress, soreness, and injury risk from wearable sensor data (28 users, 1260 data points); and (2) A retrieval module that grounds LLM-generated feedback in expert-vetted web content to ensure contextual relevance and reliability. Our predictive models, evaluated with rolling-origin cross-validation and group k-fold cross-validation show that personalized models outperform generalized baselines. In a pilot expert study (n=4), SePA's retrieval-based advice was preferred over a non-retrieval baseline, yielding meaningful practical effect (Cliff's $\\delta$=0.3, p=0.05). We also quantify latency performance trade-offs between response quality and speed, offering a transparent blueprint for next-generation, trustworthy personal health informatics systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04705v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Fashion has evolved from handcrafted designs to automated production over the years, where AI has added another dimension to it. Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04636v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite the continued anthropomorphization of AI systems, the potential impact of racialization during human-AI interaction is understudied. This study explores how human-AI cooperation may be impacted by the belief that data used to train an AI system is racialized, that is, it was trained on data from a specific group of people. During this study, participants completed a human-AI cooperation task using the Pig Chase game. Participants of different self-identified demographics interacted with AI agents whose perceived racial identities were manipulated, allowing us to assess how sociocultural perspectives influence the decision-making of participants in the game. After the game, participants completed a survey questionnaire to explain the strategies they used while playing the game and to understand the perceived intelligence of their AI teammates. Statistical analysis of task behavior data revealed a statistically significant effect of the participant's demographic, as well as the interaction between this self-identified demographic and the treatment condition (i.e., the perceived demographic of the agent). The results indicated that Non-White participants viewed AI agents racialized as White in a positive way compared to AI agents racialized as Black. Both Black and White participants viewed the AI agent in the control treatment in a negative way. A baseline cognitive model of the task using ACT-R cognitive architecture was used to understand a cognitive-level, process-based explanation of the participants' perspectives based on results found from the study. This model helps us better understand the factors affecting the decision-making strategies of the game participants. Results from analysis of these data, as well as cognitive modeling, indicate a need to expand understanding of the ways racialization (whether implicit or explicit) impacts interaction with AI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2503.14333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Studies often aim to reveal ``first-order\" representations (FORs), which encode aspects of an observer's environment, such as contents or structure. A less-common target is ``higher-order\" representations (HORs), which are ``about\" FORs -- e.g., their strength or uncertainty -- and which may contribute to learning. HORs about uncertainty are unlikely to be direct ``read-outs\" of FOR characteristics, instead reflecting noisy estimation processes incorporating prior expectations about uncertainty, but how the brain represents such expected uncertainty distributions remains largely unexplored. Here, we study ``noise expectation\" HORs using neural data from a task which may require the brain to learn about its own noise: decoded neurofeedback, wherein human subjects learn to volitionally produce target neural patterns. We develop and apply a Noise Estimation through Reinforcement-based Diffusion (NERD) model to characterize how brains may undertake this process, and show that NERD offers high explanatory power for human behavior.",

      "title": "The dynamic interplay between in-context and in-weight learning in humans and neural networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2402.08674v5 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Human learning embodies a striking duality: sometimes, we appear capable of following logical, compositional rules and benefit from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly disparate behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems -- one for rapid, rule-based inferences and another for slow, incremental adaptation. It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter type of learning, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of \"in-context learning\" (ICL) -- the ability to flexibly grasp the structure of a new task from a few examples. Here, we show that the dynamic interplay between ICL and default in-weight learning (IWL) naturally captures a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, reproducing curriculum effects on category-learning and compositional tasks, and recapitulating a tradeoff between flexibility and retention. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering a novel perspective on dual-process theories and human cognitive flexibility.",

The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.",

      "content": "arXiv:2508.13846v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which affects and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.",

Building on the geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap between AI and computational neuroscience.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04633v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation. Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a controlled biological substrate.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.05151v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins and widespread disruptions in brain function. Computational modeling has advanced our understanding of these processes, but efforts have traditionally focused on either neuronal dynamics or the underlying biological mechanisms of disease. One class of models uses neural mass and whole-brain frameworks to simulate changes in oscillations, connectivity, and network stability. A second class focuses on biological processes underlying disease progression, particularly prion-like propagation through the connectome, and glial responses and vascular mechanisms. Each modeling tradition has provided important insights, but experimental evidence shows these processes are interconnected: neuronal activity modulates protein release and clearance, while pathological burden feeds back to disrupt circuit function. Modeling these domains in isolation limits our understanding. To determine where and why disease emerges, how it spreads, and how it might be altered, we must develop integrated frameworks that capture feedback between neuronal dynamics and disease biology. In this review, we survey the two modeling approaches and highlight efforts to unify them. We argue that such integration is necessary to address key questions in neurodegeneration and to inform interventions, from targeted stimulation to control-theoretic strategies that slow progression and restore function.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.04454v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: My findings show, for the first time, what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioids induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow wave sleep. Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and other medial habenula activators slowdown respiration during SWS and anesthesia. Using DTI method I observed that human hippocampus is connected to MHb via posterior septum, while amygdala via anteromedial BNST. MHb projected to pineal gland and contralateral MHb (Vadovi\\v{c}ov\\'a, 2014). MHb has dense mu-opioids receptors (Gardon and Faget, 2014) and strong projections to IPN. Herkenham (1981) found increased glucose intake during anesthesia in MHb and IPN. The IPN projects to serotonergic MRN/DRN, and pain/interoception/arousal linked PAG. The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? This extended circuit model explains role of the dentate gyrus >posterior septum >MHb >IPN >MRN >hippocampus + BF + claustrum >cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) in memory replay, loss of awareness, anesthesia and SWS. It proposes new neural mechanisms for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN >MRN >claustrum >cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. This brain model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence and wanting. This model suggests that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, cannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, neuropeptide Y, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-proteins production-spines/synapses growth-anti-inflammatory state.",

      "title": "Altered excitability of dI3 neurons regulates hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury",
      "content": "Recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury is limited in mammals. Reactivation of locomotor circuits does occur, but primarily through the activation of sensorimotor pathways in the context of locomotor training. Previous investigations have shown that dI3 neurons, a developmentally-defined population of pre-motor, glutamatergic interneurons, are indispensable for this process. However, it remains unclear how dI3 neurons are recruited during locomotor recovery, and whether they could be leveraged to improve locomotor function following spinal cord injury. Herein, we investigated how the excitability of dI3 neurons influences locomotor behaviour and recovery after spinal cord injury. In T9-T10 transected mice, we found that acute chemogenetic silencing of dI3 neurons leads to immediate loss of hindlimb motor tone, and significant reduction in stepping during treadmill locomotion. Conversely, regular chemogenetic stimulation of dI3 neurons led to transient increases in hindlimb motor tone early after injury, but ultimately reduced hindlimb motor tone and locomotor recovery over the long term. These chronic changes resulting from dI3 neuron stimulation were associated with the absence of expression of the constitutive 5-HT2C-R isoform, potentially representing a homeostatic mechanism for the regulation of dI3 excitability following spinal cord injury. Given these findings, we hypothesized that dI3 stimulation effects on motor tone, while insufficient to drive locomotor function alone, may promote stepping improvements when locomotor rhythm-generating circuits are active. The addition of quipazine, a serotonergic agonist known to facilitate locomotor rhythmogenesis, in combination with dI3 stimulation, significantly improved locomotor function, while also mitigating the long-term reduction in treadmill stepping associated with dI3 stimulation alone. In aggregate, our results suggest that hyper-excitable dI3 neurons are involved in the maintenance of motor tone after spinal cord injury, possibly through a 5-HT2C-R-dependent mechanism, and further show that the selective stimulation of dI3 neurons could enhance the recovery of locomotor function following spinal cord injury.",
