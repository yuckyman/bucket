      "title": "Mapping the circulating proteome across neurodegeneration: A harmonized, consortium-scale framework for uncovering molecular pathophysiology",
      "content": "Large-scale plasma proteomics offers unprecedented opportunities to investigate the systemic biology of neurodegeneration, yet technical heterogeneity, site-specific artifacts, and clinical confounding remain major barriers to reproducible discovery. Leveraging data from 13,733 individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and non-impaired controls in the Global Neurodegeneration Proteomics Consortium (GNPC), we present a scalable and generalizable analytical framework for harmonizing and interpreting consortium-scale proteomic datasets. Using a high-dimensional perturbation framework, we systematically benchmark five commonly used batch correction methods across a range of realistic confounding structures, including site-disease imbalance, nonlinear effects, and heteroskedasticity. Empirical Bayes modelling via limma consistently emerged as the most robust method, optimally balancing removal of site-related technical variance with retention of disease-relevant biological signal. On this harmonized foundation, we resolve neurodegenerative disease plasma signatures, including a shared immune-metabolic axis in AD and PD, neuromuscular disruption in ALS, and proteostatic imbalance in PD. Tissue and cell-type enrichment highlight widespread immune-endocrine involvement in AD and hematopoietic activation in PD. Demographically matched analyses nominate distinct, candidate biomarkers across diseases, including lipid, redox, and complement factors in AD, lysosomal and cytoskeletal proteins in PD, and muscle-derived markers in ALS. This study establishes a scalable analytical framework for integrating real-world proteomic data and provides a disease-resolved catalogue of circulating signatures to inform biomarker development and targeted intervention across neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "Phasic dopamine encodes persistent attraction to reward cues",
      "content": "Reward-predictive cues can become attractive themselves due to incentive salience attribution. This manifests as persistent engagement with cues, known as sign-tracking. Cue-evoked phasic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) is critical for sign-tracking and cue-evoked reward craving, yet is also known to follow learning rules requiring outcome value updating. Would cue-evoked dopamine track incentive salience persistence, or change in accord with reward value alteration while failing to encode persistent behaviors? We assessed NAc dopamine activity using fiber photometry in sign-tracking rats during an omission task, in which physical cue interaction cancels reward. Animals adapted to reward loss while maintaining non-physical cue interaction reflective of persistent incentive salience. Cue-evoked dopamine remained unchanged during omission, mirroring robust incentive salience but not behavioral adaptations occurring with learning. In contrast, outcome-related dopamine reflected reward gain or loss. Therefore, cue-related dopamine encodes persistence of cue value, independent of outcome-related dopamine signals tracking reward occurrence.",

      "title": "Genetic Influences on Neural Responses in Placebo Analgesia Circuitry",
      "content": "Placebo analgesia is a well-established medical phenomenon with overlapping neural representations between humans and rodents, but the genetic contribution to this conserved neural circuitry remains unknown. Using functional brain imaging in 305 monozygotic and dizygotic twins, we quantified the heritability of neural activation in placebo analgesia brain circuity during evoked pain, including the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, brainstem and cerebellum, using the ACE model. Neural responses showed significant heritability, with additive genetics accounting for 21 to 49% of the variance (A = 0.21 to 0.49), indicating that genetics have a moderate effect on pain-evoked brain activity within the placebo analgesia circuitry. For the first time, our findings reveal a heritable component of the neural network supporting placebo analgesia. By linking genetic variations to neural responses in the placebo analgesia circuitry, this study bridges human and preclinical research and opens new ways for improving clinical trial methodology and tailoring pain therapies to individual genetic profiles.",

      "title": "Signatures of covert neuron loss in the local field potential of motor cortex",
      "content": "Background: Covert stroke is understudied despite occurring ten times for every symptomatic stroke and contributing to stroke's enormous global disease burden. For instance, it is unknown whether covert stroke replicates the peri-infarct neuroelectrophysiological frequency spectrum impact of symptomatic stroke. This motivated the use of our novel electrolytic lesioning platform to explore the spectral consequences of covert neuron loss. Methods: During a multi-month period of participation in an arm reaching task, neuron loss was induced via electrolytic lesions to the motor cortex of two large animals (U: n = 4; H: n = 7). Behavioral metrics were paired with spectrum estimates from local field potential recordings. These spectra were represented as bandpowers, aperiodic/periodic parameters, and decomposed time-frequency tensors. Lesion impact was assessed using nonparametric permutation tests of next-day effects and state space model parameters. Results: Task success rate was unaffected by lesions, but shifts in aperiodic structure reduced next-day {gamma} bandpower (30 - 100 Hz; U: -1.38V2, p < 1 x 10-3; H: -1.66V2, p = 0.001) while sensorimotor rhythms spanning 8 - 45 Hz ({Sigma}SMR) were amplified (Monkey U: 8.68V2, p < 1 x 10-3; Monkey H: 2.40V2, p = 0.004). Additionally, state space modeling showed that spectral perturbations to {gamma} and {Sigma}SMR outlasted any behavioral impact of the lesions (Monkey U: Behavior=1 d, {gamma} =2 d, {Sigma}SMR =2 d; Monkey H: Behavior=0 d, {gamma} =3 d, {Sigma}SMR =1 d). Finally, tensor decomposition revealed interpretable, animal-specific perturbations to time-frequency dynamics. Conclusion: Covert neuron loss induced multi-day spectral perturbations similar to those observed after symptomatic stroke. The neural spectrum is thus more sensitive to neuron loss than previously understood and could be responsive to neuron loss caused by covert stroke. This work also motivates the use of electrolytic lesions to bridge covert and symptomatic regimes of neuron loss, advancing our causal understanding of post-stroke interactions between spectrum and behavior.",

      "title": "Beyond the Brake: the Subthalamic Nucleus Predominantly Facilitates Action in Non-human Primates",
      "content": "The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is traditionally viewed as a brake on motor output. Challenging this model, we investigated its role in value-based decision-making by recording single-neuron activity from the primate STN during a choice task. Our findings reveal that the STN contains functionally distinct clusters of neurons and, contrary to its classical role, the vast majority of task-related neurons (approximately 89%) exhibited activity consistent with action facilitation. Two of the clusters contained facilitative neurons that increased their firing for rewarded choices, and critically, their response latency predicted saccadic reaction times on a trial-by-trial basis. Population-level analyses further demonstrated that these facilitative neurons robustly encode the upcoming choice. A smaller third cluster of neurons showed activity consistent with action suppression. These results indicate a dual function of the STN, suggesting it plays a predominant role in actively facilitating desired actions, rather than simply suppressing unwanted ones.",
