      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "A Force/Torque Taxonomy for Classifying States During Physical Co-Manipulation",
      "content": "Achieving seamless human-robot collaboration requires a deeper understanding of how agents manage and communicate forces during shared tasks. Force interactions during collaborative manipulation are inherently complex, especially when considering how they evolve over time. To address this complexity, we propose a taxonomy of decomposed force and torque components, providing a structured framework for examining haptic communication and informing the development of robots capable of performing meaningful collaborative manipulation tasks with human partners. We propose a standardized terminology for force decomposition and classification, bridging the varied language in previous literature in the field, and conduct a review of physical human-human interaction and haptic communication. The proposed taxonomy allows for a more effective and nuanced discussion of important force combinations that we expect to occur during collaborative manipulation (between human-human or human-robot teams). We also include example scenarios to illustrate the value of the proposed taxonomy in describing interactions between agents.",

      "title": "Haptic Relocation Away From the Fingertip: Where, Why, and How",
      "content": "Tactile haptic devices are often designed to render meaningful, complex, and realistic touch-based information on users\u2019 skin. While fingertips and hands are the most preferred body locations to render haptic feedback, recent trends allow such feedback to be extended to alternative body locations (e.g., wrist, arm, torso, foot) for various scenarios due to reasons such as wearability and needs of the application. In this paper, I address the new concept of haptic relocation. It refers to scenarios in which the expected feedback is related to the fingertips but rendered on a different body location instead \u2013 e.g., contact forces registered by two robotic fingers during teleoperation rendered to the users\u2019 wrist instead of the fingers. I investigated the design choices of wearable haptic devices for haptic relocation concerning different body locations, targeted applications, and actuator selection. I discuss approaches and design choices from the literature by speculating on the possible reasons, and conclude the paper by highlighting some challenges and issues to be mindful of in the future. This paper will guide engineers and researchers in searching for alternative haptic rendering solutions \u2013 especially when fingers and hands are not available for haptic interaction.",

      "content": "This review focuses on the interactions between the cutaneous senses, and in particular touch and temperature, as these are the most relevant for developing skin-based display technologies for use in virtual reality (VR) and for designing multimodal haptic devices. A broad spectrum of research is reviewed ranging from studies that have examined the mechanisms involved in thermal intensification and tactile masking, to more applied work that has focused on implementing thermal-tactile illusions such as thermal referral and illusory wetness in VR environments. Research on these tactile-thermal illusions has identified the differences between the senses of cold and warmth in terms of their effects on the perception of object properties and the prevalence of the perceptual experiences elicited. They have also underscored the fundamental spatial and temporal differences between the tactile and thermal senses. The wide-ranging body of research on compound sensations such as wetness and stickiness has highlighted the mechanisms involved in sensing moisture and provided a framework for measuring these sensations in a variety of contexts. Although the interactions between the two senses are complex, it is clear that the addition of thermal inputs to a tactile display enhances both user experience and enables novel sensory experiences.",

      "title": "A model of rhythm production and rhythmic auditory stimulation in healthy and Parkinsonian basal ganglia",
      "content": "In fMRI experiments, the basal ganglia is consistently activated by rhythmic action and sensorimotor synchronization to a metronome, and conditions like Parkinsons Disease that affect basal ganglia and its dopaminergic modulation are experimentally seen to affect performance on both types of task. However, it is not clear what role this circuit or dopaminergic modulation play during rhythm production and synchronization tasks. Here, we propose that the basal ganglia may specify, maintain, and adapt the tempo with which rhythmic action (e.g. finger tapping or walking) is performed. We build a model based on previous \"action selection\" models of the cortico-basal-ganglia loop, altered such that cortico-basal-ganglia loops correspond not to distinct actions but to a continuum of possible action tempi. During rhythm production, an initial tempo is selected by cortical input, and rhythmic action can be automatized to continue in the absence of cortical input if tonic dopamine levels in striatum are sufficiently high. When striatal dopamine is reduced, our model reproduces two key features of dopamine deprivation in Parkinsons disease: freezing of gait, and increased variation in produced intertap intervals during rhythmic tapping. By reanalyzing data from a recent experiment with Parkinsonian patients, we confirm the models prediction that increased interval variability should be largely attributable to increased tempo drift (rather than, e.g., increased timekeeper noise). This model of rhythm production is the first to invoke specific features of basal ganglia circuitry. It augments existing models of action selection in basal ganglia with the addition of continuous action parameters, and in doing so provides a starting point for further modeling of action timing and rhythm in the motor system. It offers a new model of the mechanism by which rhythmic auditory stimulation supports gait in Parkinsons patients, and makes a new, testable prediction about sensorimotor synchronization under conditions of low tonic dopamine.",

      "title": "White Matter Microstructure Fingerprint of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease",
      "content": "There is much controversy about the spatial heterogeneity and microstructural characterisation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), the neuroimaging hallmark of cerebral small vessel disease. To address this knowledge gap, we analysed relaxometry and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) together with cardiovascular risk data in a community-dwelling adult cohort (202 participants, mean age: 69.2 years, range: 53.3-85.4 years, 110 females). Following automated WMH detection, we compared MRI-derived metrics of tissue myelination, iron content, axonal density, and extracellular water, between WMH and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). Principal component analysis demonstrated a pattern of demyelination, axonal loss, and extracellular fluid accumulation, particularly pronounced in periventricular regions. The layer-specific profiles of theWMHs revealed a centrifugal gradient of white matter vulnerability, with myelin loss and extracellular water accumulation, interpreted as oedema, at the core, and ongoing axonal reorganization and demyelination in the surrounding tissue. The obtained signatures of white matter pathology were intimately linked to the aging-related increase in cardiovascular risk. High blood pressure and impaired glucose regulation, together with reduced cholesterol and hemoglobin levels, emerged as key contributors. Our findings suggest that WMHs represent the radiologically visible endpoint of a more widespread white matter damage in cerebral small vessel disease. This underscores the pressing need for early detection and consequent treatment of cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "title": "Metabolism-weighted brain connectome reveals synaptic integration and vulnerability to neurodegeneration",
      "content": "The remarkable abilities of the human brain arise from its specialized regions, which process and integrate information through complex connectivity patterns. While network science has developed various metrics to assess the degree of connectivity between these regions, it has not yet considered the level of activity within each region. Consequently, a highly connected region might be classified as a hub in the brain's connectome, even if it is weakly active or linked primarily to less active areas. Conversely, a region that is highly active but has only a few connections may be undervalued. To address this issue, we present a fully-weighted brain graph in which both edges (representing connectivity) and nodes (indicating metabolic activity) contribute to the importance, or centrality, of each region. In this model, the metabolism-weighted centrality (MwC) of each brain region integrates both connectivity and metabolic activity, using three datasets from simultaneously acquired functional MRI and metabolic FDG-PET data. We found that our fully-weighted brain graph demonstrates a greater ability to explain quantitative imaging data of signaling metabolism and its association with cognitive domains than a classical, edge-weighted graph. Additionally, regions with relatively high MwC exhibited increased synaptic and metabolic activity, as indicated by transcriptomic data. Furthermore, these regions showed higher susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. This framework of a fully-weighted brain graph represents a paradigm shift from connectivity-based metrics to an activity-aware brain graph. It offers a more biologically informed representation of brain network dynamics, connecting metabolic activity levels to higher cognitive functions as well as neurodegeneration.",
