      "title": "Artificial General Intelligence for Medical Imaging Analysis",
      "content": "Large-scale Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models, including Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT/GPT-4, have achieved unprecedented success in a variety of general domain tasks. Yet, when applied directly to specialized domains like medical imaging, which require in-depth expertise, these models face notable challenges arising from the medical field's inherent complexities and unique characteristics. In this review, we delve into the potential applications of AGI models in medical imaging and healthcare, with a primary focus on LLMs, Large Vision Models, and Large Multimodal Models. We provide a thorough overview of the key features and enabling techniques of LLMs and AGI, and further examine the roadmaps guiding the evolution and implementation of AGI models in the medical sector, summarizing their present applications, potentialities, and associated challenges. In addition, we highlight potential future research directions, offering a holistic view on upcoming ventures. This comprehensive review aims to offer insights into the future implications of AGI in medical imaging, healthcare, and beyond.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity, Heartrate Synchrony, and Eye Movements Reveal Distinct Components within Narrative Engagement and Immersion",
      "content": "Storytelling is a fundamental and universal human behavior, representing a vehicle for cultural information exchange throughout human history. In the present day, consumption of narrative audiovisual media is one of the most common recreational activities worldwide. Despite the importance and ubiquity of storytelling, relatively little is known about the neurocognitive mechanisms by which narrative media capture and sustain our attention. In this study, 40 participants watched 10 short clips from television shows of various genres while electroencephalography, eye tracking, heart rate, and self-report data were recorded. Self-reported immersion and three of the four components of narrative engagement that we examined\u2014attentional focus, emotional engagement, and narrative presence\u2014were associated with interindividual synchrony in heart rate and gaze behavior, but were associated with relatively distinct patterns of neural activity (electroencephalography power amplitude and functional connectivity). Narrative understanding, on the other hand, was not associated with heart rate or gaze synchrony. Furthermore, structural equation modeling revealed directionally opposing relationships between overall alpha-band connectivity and narrative presence on the one hand (positive), and narrative understanding (negative) on the other. These results suggest narrative understanding may be associated with a different set of neurocognitive processes to the other dimensions of narrative engagement. These findings point toward a bifurcated model of narrative engagement and raise interesting theoretical questions about the role of narrative comprehension in this process.",

      "content": "CONCLUSION: Low adherence to medication was found among 82% of cases. Factors significantly associated with adherence were gender, education, duration of treatment, and having received prior instruction. Forgetfulness and the cost of treatment were the most common factors leading to low treatment adherence. Among 79 participants who were observed for the drop instillation technique, 43% were found to have instilled it properly.",

      "content": "In the oral cavity, oral stereognosis and chemesthesis refer to the abilities to recognize shapes and detect noxious substances, respectively, through various receptors distributed on the tongue. The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

      "content": "In our day-to-day activities, we utilize not only the pads of our fingers but also the sides and hemispherical tips when manipulating objects. For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",
