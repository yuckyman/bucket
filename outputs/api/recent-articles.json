      "content": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM)\u2014quantum theory applications outside of physics\u2014are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose, as well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not only concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also with QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT)\u2014a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical \u201coscillatory cognition\u201d of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, that is, \u201cmental entanglement.\u201d We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing \u201clocal observables\u201d and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on \u201cmental entanglement\u201d detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",

      "title": "Ask HN: How can I get better at using AI for programming?",
      "content": "<p>I've been working on a personal project recently, rewriting an old jQuery + Django project into SvelteKit. The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.<p>I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.<p>This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).<p>Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255285\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255285</a></p>\n<p>Points: 16</p>\n<p># Comments: 9</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi Indie Hackers \nWe\u2019re building Kinkora, a creative platform that brings multiple image and video AI models into one place for experimentation and creation.<p>Like many builders, we found ourselves constantly switching tools just to test different models or creative directions. Each platform felt limited to a single workflow or use case. So we decided to build a space that\u2019s more modular, exploratory, and creator-first.<p>Kinkora focuses on:<p>Supporting popular generative models<p>Making experimentation fast and enjoyable<p>Laying the foundation for a creative community, not just a generator<p>Our long-term goal isn\u2019t just \u201cgenerate content\u201d, but to create a place where creators can play, iterate, and discover new ideas as models and techniques evolve.<p>We\u2019re early, actively iterating, and would love feedback from fellow indie builders on:<p>Feature direction<p>Community mechanics<p>Creator-friendly workflows<p>Happy to answer any questions</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255697\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46255697</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 3</p>",
