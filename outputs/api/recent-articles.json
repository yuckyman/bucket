      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis.

      "title": "Revealing AI Reasoning Increases Trust but Crowds Out Unique Human Knowledge",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.04050v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective human-AI collaboration requires humans to accurately gauge AI capabilities and calibrate their trust accordingly. Humans often have context-dependent private information, referred to as Unique Human Knowledge (UHK), that is crucial for deciding whether to accept or override AI's recommendations. We examine how displaying AI reasoning affects trust and UHK utilization through a pre-registered, incentive-compatible experiment (N = 752). We find that revealing AI reasoning, whether brief or extensive, acts as a powerful persuasive heuristic that significantly increases trust and agreement with AI recommendations. Rather than helping participants appropriately calibrate their trust, this transparency induces over-trust that crowds out UHK utilization. Our results highlight the need for careful consideration when revealing AI reasoning and call for better information design in human-AI collaboration systems.",

      "content": "Motor imagery (MI), the mental rehearsal of movement without physical execution, is a key technique in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for voluntarily eliciting cortical modulations. Beyond cortical effects, MI could also modulate spinal cord processing, which offers additional potential for neurorehabilitation in conditions like spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke, where BCIs are used for therapy. To investigate the interactions of MI with both the cortex and the spinal cord, we employed both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and trans-spinal magnetic stimulation (TSMS). With proper coil orientation, TSMS elicited short- and long-latency motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in forearm muscles and lateralized evoked potentials in the cortex. MI modulated both TMS-induced and TSMS-induced cortical responses and MEPs. This demonstration of MI affecting both cortical and spinal circuitry underscores its potential as a powerful strategy for BCI-driven neurorehabilitation, including pairing MI with magnetic stimulation.",

      "title": "Phase-Specific Hippocampal and Cortical Medial Temporal Lobe Involvement in Allocentric Working Memory",
      "content": "The hippocampus and cortices of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions are increasingly implicated in working memory, but their precise contributions--particularly during delay maintenance--remain debated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the involvement of hippocampal and cortical MTL in a demanding allocentric working memory task requiring relational binding. A total of 128 healthy human adults (92 females) aged 20-83 (mean 39) years performed an allocentric working memory task during fMRI, in which object-location bindings had to be learned, maintained, and manipulated across an 8 second delay. The design included a staircase procedure to balance task difficulty across participants and a passive viewing condition to control for perceptual and attentional demands. Across the full sample, anterior and mid hippocampal subregions and cortical MTL areas were engaged in all phases, showing study-related activation, widespread delay-phase deactivation with region-specific sustained responses, and posterior hippocampal and cortical MTL reactivation during test. Contrary to predictions, hippocampal and cortical MTL activation did not vary with performance among younger adults. Instead, differences emerged in a left temporoparietal cluster, potentially reflecting verbal encoding strategies. Older adults, relative to younger adults with the most comparable performance levels, showed lower anterior hippocampal activation and smaller correct-passive viewing differences in perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices. Taken together, these findings accord with hippocampal subregions and cortical MTL involvement across the temporal unfolding of allocentric working memory, but with distinct phase-specific roles.",

      "content": "RNA regulatory mechanisms mediate adaptive responses requiring rapid gene expression changes. Examining microRNA (miRNA)-mediated control of structural synaptic plasticity, we identified miR-219 and six other conserved miRNAs regulating activity-induced morphogenesis at Drosophila glutamatergic synapses. Among miRNA targets downregulated by acute stimulation, the Ral-activating factor RalGPS is necessary for presynaptic morphogenesis and sufficient to block plasticity. Stimulation elevates miR-219 loading into Argonaute complexes without altering mature miR-219 levels, revealing a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. We conclude that activity-induced miRNA loading modulates Ral signaling via RalGPS to enable presynaptic remodeling and growth, establishing a novel link between neuronal activity and synaptic structural plasticity.",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Interleaving cortex-analog mixing improves deep non-negative matrix factorization networks",
      "content": "Considering biological constraints in artificial neural networks has led to dramatic improvements in performance. Nevertheless, to date, the positivity of long-range signals in the cortex has not been shown to yield improvements. While Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) captures biological constraints of positive long-range interactions, deep convolutional neural networks with NMF modules do not match the performance of conventional neural networks (CNNs) of a similar size. This work shows that introducing intermediate modules that combine the NMF's positive activities, analogous to the processing in cortical columns, leads to improved performance on benchmark data that exceeds that of vanilla deep convolutional networks. This demonstrates that including positive long-range signaling together with local interactions of both signs in analogy to cortical hyper-columns has the potential to enhance the performance of deep networks.",
