      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-\">https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-</a></p> <p>I don't know about everyone else, but I didn't want to pay for a server, and didn't want to host one on my computer. I have a flagship phone; an S25+ with Snapdragon 8 and 12 GB RAM. It's ridiculous. I wanted to run intense computational coding on my phone, and didn't have a solution to keep my phone from overheating. So. I built one. This is non-rooted using sys-reads and Termux (found on F-Droid for sensor access) and Termux API (found on F-Droid), so you can keep your warranty. \ud83d\udd25</p> <p>What my project does: Monitors core temperatures using sys reads and Termux API. It models thermal activity using Newton's Law of Cooling to predict thermal events before they happen and prevent Samsung's aggressive performance throttling at 42\u00b0 C. </p> <p>Target audience: Developers who want to run an intensive server on an S25+ without rooting or melting their phone. </p> <p>Comparison: I haven't seen other predictive thermal modeling used on a phone before. The hardware is concrete and physics can be very good at modeling phone behavior in relation to workload patterns. Samsung itself uses a reactive and throttling system rather than predicting thermal events. Heat is continuous and temperature isn't an isolated event. </p> <p>I didn't want to pay for a server, and I was also interested in the idea of mobile computing. As my workload increased, I noticed my phone would have temperature problems and performance would degrade quickly. I studied physics and realized that the cores in my phone and the hardware components were perfect candidates for modeling with physics. By using a &quot;thermal tank&quot; where you know how much heat is going to be generated by various workloads through machine learning, you can predict thermal events before they happen and defer operations so that the 42\u00b0 C thermal throttle limit is never reached. At this limit, Samsung aggressively throttles performance by about 50%, which can cause performance problems, which can generate more heat, and the spiral can get out of hand quickly. </p> <p>My solution is simple: never reach 42\u00b0 C</p> <p>Physics-Based Thermal Prediction for Mobile Hardware - Validation Results</p> <p>Core claim: Newton's law of cooling works on phones. 0.58\u00b0C MAE over 152k predictions, 0.24\u00b0C for battery. Here's the data.</p> <p>THE PHYSICS</p> <p>Standard Newton's law: T(t) = T_amb + (T\u2080 - T_amb)\u00b7exp(-t/\u03c4) + (P\u00b7R/k)\u00b7(1 - exp(-t/\u03c4))</p> <p>Measured thermal constants per zone on Samsung S25+ (Snapdragon 8 Elite):</p> <ul> <li>Battery: \u03c4=210s, thermal mass 75 J/K (slow response)</li> <li>GPU: \u03c4=95s, thermal mass 40 J/K</li> <li>MODEM: \u03c4=80s, thermal mass 35 J/K</li> <li>CPU_LITTLE: \u03c4=60s, thermal mass 40 J/K</li> <li>CPU_BIG: \u03c4=50s, thermal mass 20 J/K</li> </ul> <p>These are from step response testing on actual hardware. Battery's 210s time constant means it lags\u2014CPUs spike first during load changes.</p> <p>Sampling at 1Hz uniform, 30s prediction horizon. Single-file architecture because filesystem I/O creates thermal overhead on mobile.</p> <p>VALIDATION DATA</p> <p>152,418 predictions over 6.25 hours continuous operation.</p> <p>Overall accuracy:</p> <ul> <li>Transient-filtered: 0.58\u00b0C MAE (95th percentile 2.25\u00b0C)</li> <li>Steady-state: 0.47\u00b0C MAE</li> <li>Raw data (all transients): 1.09\u00b0C MAE</li> <li>96.5% within 5\u00b0C</li> <li>3.5% transients during workload discontinuities</li> </ul> <p>Physics can't predict regime changes\u2014expected limitation.</p> <p>Per-zone breakdown (transient-filtered, 21,774 predictions each):</p> <ul> <li>BATTERY: 0.24\u00b0C MAE (max error 2.19\u00b0C)</li> <li>MODEM: 0.75\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.84\u00b0C)</li> <li>CPU_LITTLE: 0.83\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.92\u00b0C)</li> <li>GPU: 0.84\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.78\u00b0C)</li> <li>CPU_BIG: 0.88\u00b0C MAE (max error 4.97\u00b0C)</li> </ul> <p>Battery hits 0.24\u00b0C which matters because Samsung throttles at 42\u00b0C. CPUs sit around 0.85\u00b0C, acceptable given fast thermal response.</p> <p>Velocity-dependent performance:</p> <ul> <li>Low velocity (&lt;0.001\u00b0C/s median): 0.47\u00b0C MAE, 76,209 predictions</li> <li>High velocity (&gt;0.001\u00b0C/s): 1.72\u00b0C MAE, 76,209 predictions</li> </ul> <p>Low velocity: system behaves predictably. High velocity: thermal discontinuities break the model. Use CPU velocity &gt;3.0\u00b0C/s as regime change detector instead of trusting physics during spikes.</p> <p>STRESS TEST RESULTS</p> <p>Max load with CPUs sustained at 95.4\u00b0C, 2,418 predictions over ~6 hours.</p> <p>Accuracy during max load:</p> <ul> <li>Raw (all predictions): 8.44\u00b0C MAE</li> <li>Transients (&gt;5\u00b0C error): 32.7% of data</li> <li>Filtered (&lt;5\u00b0C error): 1.23\u00b0C MAE, 67.3% of data</li> </ul> <p>Temperature ranges observed:</p> <ul> <li>CPU_LITTLE: peaked at 95.4\u00b0C</li> <li>CPU_BIG: peaked at 81.8\u00b0C</li> <li>GPU: peaked at 62.4\u00b0C</li> <li>Battery: stayed at 38.5\u00b0C</li> </ul> <p>System tracks recovery accurately once transients pass. Can't predict the workload spike itself\u2014that's a physics limitation, not a bug.</p> <p>DESIGN CONSTRAINTS</p> <p>Mobile deployment running production workload (particle simulations + GIF encoding, 8 workers) on phone hardware. Variable thermal environments mean 10-70\u00b0C ambient range is operational reality.</p> <p>Single-file architecture (4,160 lines): Multiple module imports equal multiple filesystem reads equal thermal spikes. One file loads once, stays cached. Constraint-driven\u2014the thermal monitoring system can't be thermally expensive.</p> <p>Dual-condition throttle:</p> <ul> <li>Battery temp prediction: 0.24\u00b0C MAE, catches sustained heating (\u03c4=210s lag)</li> <li>CPU velocity &gt;3.0\u00b0C/s: catches regime changes before physics fails</li> </ul> <p>Combined approach handles both slow battery heating and fast CPU spikes.</p> <p>BOTTOM LINE</p> <p>Physics works:</p> <ul> <li>0.58\u00b0C MAE filtered</li> <li>0.47\u00b0C steady-state</li> <li>0.24\u00b0C battery (tight enough for Samsung's 42\u00b0C throttle)</li> <li>Can't predict discontinuities (3.5% transients)</li> <li>Recovers to 1.23\u00b0C MAE after spikes clear</li> </ul> <p>Constraint-driven engineering for mobile: single file, measured constants, dual-condition throttle.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-\">https://github.com/DaSettingsPNGN/S25_THERMAL-</a></p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DaSettingsPNGN\"> /u/DaSettingsPNGN </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p37186/the_pocket_computer_how_to_run_computational/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p37186/the_pocket_computer_how_to_run_computational/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I'm mostly a low-level engineer, HPC modeling and simulation and signal processing and the employer knows this. And this sort of thing isn't as the position was described.</p> <p>I assume this is their standard question, regardless of the candidate: </p> <hr /> <p>Please write code to download the current dataset, store the data server-side, create APIs that can retrieve the server-side stored data, and provide a UI to analyze it for items such as word count per department, historical changes over time, and a checksum for each department.</p> <p>Only implement analysis that would provide meaningful information to the user.</p> <p>Please add at least one custom metric that you believe may help inform decisions more effectively.</p> <hr /> <p>Without environment setup, they designed this to take under 6 hours. I can see it taking that long for someone who does this sort of thing every day currently, but with my background, this is completely different. </p> <p>Just looking to see if I am off-base in my assessment that this is way more than 6 hours of work or if they simply expect me to shove it into an LLM and go from there. Which is probably what I am going to do, since I need to learn a lot of new tech to do it regardless.</p> <p>--edit--</p> <p>Thanks for the feedback. Definitely feels like a lot and my inner cynic definitely leans towards them trying to take advantage of some free work. That being said, it's a company and gig I'd really like to land, so probably going to take a stab at it. Definitely going to use some LLMs to get the ball rolling, since I never used Django. My experience is almost all low-level C/C++ dev, so this is a new path for me (and one that I want to undertake). Going to probably put some mornings into it. </p> <p>First: Getting a good dev environment set up for it and getting the ingestion pipeline work with it. Will most likely just use sqlLite for the quick backend. It's ingesting most json documents, so I don't think I am going to have to do a bunch of data modeling (especially for a quick project - will make notes for the following interview discussions though).</p> <p>Morning 2: Get the personal apis up and running and maybe start a very barebones UI for it (I hate doing UI work - doing it daily got me to leave a former job).</p> <p>Morning 3: Do a bit of clean up and maybe some new metric to put in.</p> <p>I dislike using LLMs for generating code - so not thrilled about it - I know there will be massive holes in my understanding - but worst case, it will be an interesting learning experience for it. </p> <p>Thanks again for all the feedback, really appreciate it. Any further advice is appreciated as well - what type of stumbling blocks am I likely to run into, things to watch out for, etc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_Nomadic__\"> /u/_Nomadic__ </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p2wgpx/looking_for_a_sanity_check_on_an_interview/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p2wgpx/looking_for_a_sanity_check_on_an_interview/\">[comments]</a></span>",
