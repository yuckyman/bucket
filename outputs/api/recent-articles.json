      "title": "Untangling cross-regional cross-frequency coupling in dynamic neural oscillations",
      "content": "Objective. Brain networks communicate through long range phase coupling of low frequency oscillations (LFOs, less than 35 Hz) between brain regions. At the same time, phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which the phase of the same LFO have been shown to modulate the power of high frequency activity has also been reported across brain regions as a critical regulator of neural activity and excitability. While cross-regional CFC has been reported as a potential mechanism of long-distance modulation of neural excitability, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon has yet to be understood and methods to dissociate the effect of local vs remote LFO have not been developed. Cross-regional CFC can be a result of either LFOs in one region directly modulating high frequency oscillations in another region or due to a chain effect, in which apparent cross-regional CFC results from coupling of LFO across sites. Approach. A novel method of partial modulation index (PMI) is proposed as a derivation of modulation index (MI) and based on Pearl\u2019s do-calculus to remove the mathematical bias of simultaneous phase coupling and CFC measurements. Here, we first test the PMI on a simulated dataset, showing it can differentiate between biased and unbiased CFC. We then evaluate the method on intracranially collected local field potentials recorded simultaneously from thalamus and cortex in a patient undergoing deep brain stimulator implantation for essential tremor, demonstrating that the observed thalamocortical CFC was partially biased. Main results. For both simulated and human datasets, the PMI was compared to the conventional MI. In simulated data, the PMI was able to disentangle cross-regional phase coupling and focal CFC which is not possible using conventional MI. While there is no ground truth for comparison in human data, the results from the simulated data demonstrate the value of the proposed method in removing mathematical bias. Significance. This novel method facilitates a mathematically rigorous characterization of residual CFC, enabling investigations of differential contributions and roles of brain-wide LFO to CFC, which can lead to a more complete understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological processes and disorders.",

      "title": "Measuring mild cognitive impairment whole-brain electroencephalography phase-amplitude coupling connectivity using polar mutual information",
      "content": "Objective. A novel phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimator is proposed to address the limitations of existing PAC estimators in terms of insufficient application scenarios. Approach. The polar mutual information (PoMI) method is compared with the currently dominant PAC estimators, mean vector length, Kullback\u2013Libler distance, general linear model, and phase-locking value, focusing on analyzing its characteristics in terms of coupling strength sensitivity, data length dependency, noise resistance, and coupling frequency band sensitivity. We recruited 54 healthy controls and 41 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and assessed their cognitive level and whole-brain PAC connectivity by neurophysiological tests and resting electroencephalography, respectively. Main results. The PoMI algorithm is sensitive to changes in coupling strength, exhibits low dependence on data length, is insensitive to noise variations, and produces stable computational outcomes. Therefore, the PoMI algorithm can quantify the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations. Furthermore, reduced PAC connectivity in the frontal lobe of patients with MCI, while PAC activity is enhanced in the parietal and occipital lobes. The results indicate that alterations in prefrontal PAC connectivity in MCI patients may represent one manifestation of neuronal group degeneration in the prefrontal cortex of these individuals. Significance. The PoMI algorithm can effectively evaluate the PAC phenomenon in neural oscillations and can be used as a PAC estimator. (Approved No. of ethic committee: 2024-P2-210-02).",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

That's why I started writing my own DI package.</p> <p>I've been developing it alone for about 2 years now, and today I feel it has reached a very satisfying state.</p> <h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>Here are the main features of <code>python-injection</code>: - DI based on type annotation analysis - Dependency registration with decorators - 4 types of lifetimes (transient, singleton, constant, and scoped) - A scoped dependency can be constructed with a context manager - Async support (also works in a fully sync environment) - Ability to swap certain dependencies based on a profile - Dependencies are instantiated when you need them - Supports Python 3.12 and higher</p> <p>To elaborate a bit, I put a lot of effort into making the package API easy and accessible for any developer.</p> <p>The only drawback I can find is that you need to remember to import the Python scripts where the decorators are used.</p> <h2>Syntax Examples</h2> <p>Here are some syntax examples you'll find in my package.</p> <p>Register a transient: ```python from injection import injectable</p> <p>@injectable class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Register a singleton: ```python from injection import singleton</p> <p>@singleton class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Register a constant: ```python from injection import set_constant</p> <p>@dataclass(frozen=True) class Settings: api_key: str</p> <p>settings = set_constant(Settings(&quot;&lt;secret_api_key&gt;&quot;)) ```</p> <p>Register an async dependency: ```python from injection import injectable</p> <p>class AsyncDependency: ...</p> <p>@injectable async def async_dependency_recipe() -&gt; AsyncDependency: # async stuff return AsyncDependency() ```</p> <p>Register an implementation of an abstract class: ```python from injection import injectable</p> <p>class AbstractDependency(ABC): ...</p> <p>@injectable(on=AbstractDependency) class Dependency(AbstractDependency): ... ```</p> <p>Open a custom scope:</p> <ul> <li>I recommend using a <code>StrEnum</code> for your scope names.</li> <li>There's also an async version: <code>adefine_scope</code>. ```python from injection import define_scope</li> </ul> <p>def some_function(): with define_scope(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;): # do things inside scope ... ```</p> <p>Open a custom scope with bindings: ```python from injection import MappedScope</p> <p>type Locale = str</p> <p>@dataclass(frozen=True) class Bindings: locale: Locale</p> <pre><code>scope = MappedScope(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;) </code></pre> <p>def some_function(): with Bindings(&quot;fr_FR&quot;).scope.define(): # do things inside scope ... ```</p> <p>Register a scoped dependency: ```python from injection import scoped</p> <p>@scoped(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;) class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Register a scoped dependency with a context manager: ```python from collections.abc import Iterator from injection import scoped</p> <p>class Dependency: def open(self): ... def close(self): ...</p> <p>@scoped(&quot;&lt;scope_name&gt;&quot;) def dependency_recipe() -&gt; Iterator[Dependency]: dependency = Dependency() dependency.open() try: yield dependency finally: dependency.close() ```</p> <p>Register a dependency in a profile:</p> <ul> <li>Like scopes, I recommend a <code>StrEnum</code> to store your profile names. ```python from injection import mod</li> </ul> <p>@mod(&quot;&lt;profile_name&gt;&quot;).injectable class Dependency: ... ```</p> <p>Load a profile: ```python from injection.loaders import load_profile</p> <p>def main(): load_profile(&quot;&lt;profile_name&gt;&quot;) # do stuff ```</p> <p>Inject dependencies into a function: ```python from injection import inject</p> <p>@inject def some_function(dependency: Dependency): # do stuff ...</p> <p>some_function() # &lt;- call function without arguments ```</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>It's made for Python developers who never want to deal with dependency injection headaches again. I'm currently using it in my projects, so I think it's production-ready.</p> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>It's much simpler to get started with than most competitors, requires virtually no configuration, and isn't very invasive (if you want to get rid of it, you just need to remove the decorators and your code remains reusable).</p> <p>I'd love to read your feedback on it so I can improve it.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for reading my post.</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/100nm/python-injection\">https://github.com/100nm/python-injection</a> PyPI: <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/python-injection\">https://pypi.org/project/python-injection</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Skearways\"> /u/Skearways </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pc77j2/i_spent_2_years_building_a_deadsimple_dependency/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pc77j2/i_spent_2_years_building_a_deadsimple_dependency/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "The effect of data preprocessing on spike correlation analysis results",
      "content": "In recent years, an increasing number of large electrophysiological data sets have become publicly available, thereby providing researchers with the opportunity to analyze spike train data without conducting their own experiments. While this is undoubtedly a positive development, it increases the need for proper documentation on how the data were collected and what preprocessing was performed on the data, since interpreting analysis results in ignorance of these pieces of information can lead to wrong conclusions. An important preprocessing step is the removal of artifacts from the recordings. Electrophysiological recordings are particularly susceptible to electrical cross-talks between recording channels, resulting in artifact spikes that are coincident in multiple channels on the time scale of the data sampling rate, i.e., 1/30 ms in popular setups. The removal by signal whitening is only possible if also the raw sampled data are available, thus to eliminate this type of artifact is to remove all coincident spikes on the recording time scale to definitely avoid artifact spikes. However, given the lack of the \"ground truth\", this step has the potential to eliminate, in conjunction with the artifacts, components of the data that are pertinent to the research objective. In this study, we use a modified version of the Unitary Event Analysis and demonstrate that such preprocessing results in significantly lower correlations than expected by chance even on longer time scales. We also propose a method to correct for the bias introduced by this preprocessing. Thus, slight changes in the preprocessing have potentially strong impact on analysis results and methods need to consider these effects.",

      "title": "snRNA-seq of Huntington's disease mice reveals vulnerability profiles of cortical cell types",
      "content": "A common feature of neurodegeneration is selective vulnerability, where certain neurons succumb to disease, while others remain spared. The molecular underpinnings of these differences remain elusive. Here, we performed transcriptomic profiling of the motor cortex in a mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD), an incurable hereditary movement disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin gene. Strikingly, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed a clear transcriptomic separation of HD and control samples within the vulnerable glutamatergic, but not disease-resistant GABAergic cell clusters. Tissue sampling at different time points allowed us to delineate a two-stage disease trajectory with distinct changes at early and late stages. Analysis of differentially expressed genes demonstrated progressive dysregulation of neuronal cell-type identity and upregulation of ER-phagy receptors. Mechanistic investigations in cellular HD models revealed increased ER-phagy, while knockdown of the ER-phagy receptor Tex264 resulted in elevated levels of the ER stress marker BiP, suggesting a protective role of ER-phagy in HD. Taken together, these findings advance our understanding of differential neuronal vulnerability, and identify ER-phagy as a new pathway in HD pathogenesis.",

      "title": "Training neural networks from scratch in a videogame leads to brittle brain encoding",
      "content": "Recent brain-encoding studies using videogame tasks suggest that the training objective of an artificial neural network plays a central role in how well the network's representations align with brain activity. This study investigates the alignment of artificial neural network activations with brain activity elicited by a video game task using models trained from scratch in controlled settings. We specifically compared three model training objectives: reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and a vision task, while accounting for other potential factors which may impact performance such as training data and model architecture. We tested models on brain encoding, i.e. their ability to predict functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals acquired while human subjects played different levels of the video game Super Mario Bros. When tested on new playthroughs from the game levels seen at training, the reinforcement learning objective had a small but significant advantage in brain encoding, followed by the imitation learning and vision models. We hypothesized that brain-aligned representations would emerge only in task-competent models, and that the specific brain regions well encoded by a model would depend on the nature of the task it was trained on. While brain encoding did improve during model training, even an untrained model with matching architecture approached the performance of the best models. Contrary to our hypotheses, no model layers or specific training objectives aligned preferentially with specific brain areas. Large performance gaps also persisted in fully trained models across game levels, both those seen during training and entirely novel ones. Overall, even though reinforcement learning presented a small advantage to train brain encoding models for videogame data, all tested brain encoding models exhibited brittle performance with limited generalization both within- and out-of-distribution. Overall, our results suggest that training small artificial models from scratch is not sufficiently reliable, and that incorporating pretrained models such as foundation vision-action models may ultimately be necessary to support robust inferences about brain representations.",

      "title": "Neurodynamics of prefrontal areas in volitional contexts: a comparative study based on computational modelling and EEG/ERP data",
      "content": "Volitional action arises from the interaction between internal intentions and external stimuli, yet the neural dynamics distinguishing self-initiated from externally triggered actions remain unclear. Here, we combine human EEG/ERP data with simulations from a phenomenological neurocomputational model of prefrontal control to examine the neurodynamic principles underlying different types of volitional behaviors. Using an extended version of our previously developed model, we generated neural activity patterns corresponding to self-initiated and externally triggered actions by manipulating the balance between endogenous and exogenous inputs to lateral prefrontal subregions. We then qualitatively compared these simulated dynamics with empirical EEG data from a perceptual decision-making task involving voluntary and instructed skip actions.  Across both datasets, self-initiated actions showed a gradual buildup of activity, marked reductions in cross-trial variability, sharper state transitions, and beta-gamma frequency shifts; in contrast, externally triggered actions exhibited minimal variability reduction, weaker transitions, and largely stable frequency content. These convergent results suggest that self-initiated actions are supported by distinct preparatory dynamics, characterized by internal competition and stabilization of neural states, whereas externally triggered actions rely primarily on externally driven input. Together, these findings identify candidate neurodynamic signatures of intention formation and highlight how simplified computational models can reproduce and help explain key features of volitional control observed in human electrophysiology.",

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental origin of seizures in Lowe syndrome",
      "content": "Lowe syndrome (LS) is a rare X-linked monogenic disorder resulting from mutations in the OCRL1 gene that encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase enzyme. Patients with LS exhibit a range of neurological symptoms, including neurodevelopmental delays, hypotonia, febrile seizures, and behavioural abnormalities; however, the cellular and developmental origins of LS remain poorly understood. The Drosophila genome encodes a single homolog of OCRL (docrl). Here, we report that a germline null allele of docrl (docrlKO) shows heat induced seizures reminiscent of the febrile seizures in LS patients. Cell type specific deletion of docrl in neurons was sufficient to recapitulate the heat induced seizures seen in docrlKO indicating a cell autonomous requirement of docrl in neurons to prevent seizures. Temporally controlled deletion of docrl showed that heat induced seizure in adults were predetermined by a requirement of docrl in neural stem cells during embryonic neurogenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate the developmental origin of the neurological manifestations of LS highlighting the need to target potential therapeutic interventions during this developmental time window.",
