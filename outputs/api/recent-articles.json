      "title": "The atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer tianeptine disinhibits hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by reducing GABAergic neurotransmission",
      "content": "Tianeptine is an atypical antidepressant and cognitive enhancer whose actions are thought to be dependent on the activation of opioid receptors, including mu-opioid receptors expressed on hippocampal interneurons. Agonists of these receptors can cause a disinhibition of principal neurons by inhibiting GABA release or interneuron firing. However, direct evidence for a similar action of tianeptine has not previously been reported. We therefore studied the effects of tianeptine on in vivo and in vitro measures of inhibitory synaptic transmission. CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) and local field potential (LFP) activity were recorded in area CA1 of anaesthetised rats. To obtain a more direct measure of the actions of tianeptine on GABA release, we also conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (sIPSCs and eIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Intrahippocampal infusion of tianeptine (15 mM; 1 microlitre) caused a marked reduction in paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) of the population spike (20-ms inter-stimulus interval) elicited in the CA1 cell-body layer. Separate recordings in the stratum radiatum revealed an enhancement of beta and gamma-frequency LFP activity, an effect of tianeptine that we have reported previously. Infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline caused a similar reduction in PPI but did not induce beta/gamma oscillations. In mouse hippocampal slices, tianeptine (50 micromolar) reduced both sIPSC frequency and eIPSC amplitude. These results confirm that tianeptine causes a disinhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells, but suggest that a simple blockade of GABAergic transmission is not alone sufficient to explain its effects on hippocampal network activity.",

      "title": "Fully Human Stem Cell-Derived BBB Model for Clinical Disease Modeling and Neurotropic AAV selection",
      "content": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly functionalized vascular interface which regulates the exchange of substances between the neural parenchyma and its periphery. In vitro models of the BBB have rapidly evolved into elaborated structures, but their cellular components are currently highly heterogeneous in origin and maturation state. Here, we have developed novel procedures to establish reproducible and scalable sources of endothelial, mural and astroglial cells generating a fully human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived BBB model, termed thBBBA, which develops mature functional properties with high barrier impermeability. Mature thBBBAs can also be generated by frozen hPSC-derived cell samples, providing a simple and scalable off-the-shelf system. thBBBAs were instrumental in identifying the critical pathological role of an IL-6 autocrine source in disrupting thBBBA integrity, increasing its permeability to NMDAR antibodies from autoimmune encephalitis patients, and revealing the therapeutic effects of tocilizumab in this setting. Additionally, we have shown that thBBBAs are an invaluable system for ranking the clinical readiness of novel engineered AAV neurotropic capsids, previously selected in animal models or in vitro systems.",

      "title": "Tirzepatide Synergizes with Leptin on Weight Loss and Restoring Metabolic Homeostasis in Diet-induced Obesity Model",
      "content": "Leptin resistance limits anti-obesity efficacy. We identified a leptin-sensitizing mechanism through tirzepatide (TZP), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) dual-agonist. Our tirzepatide clinical trial revealed that circulating leptin levels at baseline correlated with weight loss efficacy in patients with obesity, suggesting leptin and tirzepatide could interact to achieve stronger effects on weight loss. Next, we utilized the diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice and demonstrated the synergistic effects of tirzepatide and leptin combination (TZP+Lep) on weight loss. TZP+Lep treatment further improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and upregulated thermogenetic gene expression in brown adipose tissue. Metabolic profiling under thermoneutrality revealed TZP+Lep treatment further reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure. Tirzepatide sensitized leptin signaling in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and GLP-1R expressing neurons. TZP+Lep synergistically increased POMC neuronal firing by decreasing the inhibitory postsynaptic input. Together, our work showed combining tirzepatide and leptin as a potential way for better maintenance of metabolic homeostasis in obesity management.",

      "title": "Direction and orientation preferences in mouse superior colliculus and its retinal inputs exhibit a topography of cardinal biases atop locally mixed tuning",
      "content": "In mouse superior colliculus (SC), neurons are robustly tuned to motion direction and orientation, but it remains controversial whether these preferences form global maps or are arranged in a salt-and-pepper fashion, and how this organization relates to that found in the retina and, specifically, the retinal input to the SC. We addressed these questions by combining two-photon calcium imaging of retinal boutons and SC neurons in superficial SC with Neuropixels recordings across the full depth of SC. We then asked how direction and orientation preferences depend on visual-field location and how tuning similarity among units depend on lateral and vertical distance. Retinal boutons were strongly tuned and closely matched the topographic organization of direction- and orientation-selective ganglion cells, confirming that SC receives a highly ordered, retino-centric code for motion and edges. With increasing depth, SC neurons progressively deviated from this organization. Pairwise and population analyses revealed only weak local clustering, confined to very small spatial scales, and no robust global maps of direction or orientation. These results show that mouse SC inherits a topographic organization of cardinal directions and orientations from the retina and transforms it into a broad coverage of directions and orientations at every visual location, likely supporting readout for diverse visually guided behaviors.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of a teletherapy-based phonological short-term memory training in reducing phonological impairments in the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia: a multiple case study",
      "content": "The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is marked by phonological short-term memory deficits that compromise repetition and communication. While previous interventions in PPA have primarily targeted lexical-semantic abilities, little is known about therapies that directly address phonological impairments, primarily through teletherapy. This first study investigated the efficacy of an intensive phonological short-term memory training program delivered via teletherapy in individuals with the lvPPA. The intervention aimed to improve repetition of trained items, promote generalization to untrained items, facilitate transfer to functional tasks, and ensure maintenance over time. In the present study, significant improvements were observed in both immediate and delayed repetition of trained items, with partial short-term generalization to untrained items, particularly for words in delayed tasks. No substantial generalization effects were observed for functional language tasks, including picture description and picture naming, suggesting that the intervention\u2019s impact may remain task specific. Individual trajectories revealed heterogeneous responses, potentially influenced by baseline cognitive profiles, spontaneous strategies, or fatigue. Mixed-effects models confirmed that interindividual factors explained a substantial portion of the variance. These findings support the feasibility and clinical relevance of remote phonological training in the lvPPA and underline the importance of early, personalized interventions. The study also raises the hypothesis that delayed repetition may facilitate internal rehearsal, enhancing generalization. Further research is needed to assess broader functional outcomes and optimize protocol scalability.",
