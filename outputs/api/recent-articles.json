      "title": "Strengthening interhemispheric connectivity increases interregional information transfer between human primary motor areas",
      "content": "Communication between brain regions is thought to be supported by the temporal alignment of their oscillatory activity creating rhythmic windows of opportunity for efficient information transfer. We examined this possibility by manipulating the strength of coupling between the left primary motor cortex (lM1) and the right primary motor cortex (rM1) and examined the impact on activity transfer between the two areas measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 60 right-handed individuals. In three experiments we manipulated the strength of the pathway connecting the lM1 and rM1 by applying paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) using three different patterns, two of which increase interregional coupling strength. We measured the impact on EEG communication transfer in the alpha, beta, and theta bands at rest. Augmenting the strength of the lM1-to-rM1 pathway enhanced the interregional communication volume in the high-theta/low alpha band, and both volume and speed in the beta band, respectively. These changes, visible at rest, are related to changes in the transcallosal inhibitory influence of the lM1 over rM1 cortical excitability following ccPAS. By contrast, augmenting the rM1-to-lM1 route failed to modulate communication transfer in right-handed individuals. The results provide direct evidence of oscillatory intra-areal information transfer, demonstrating a link between motor network physiology and the resonant frequencies mediating its interactions.",

      "title": "The Sweet Spot of Plasticity in Perceptual Learning Dependson Training Variability",
      "content": "Perceptual learning improves sensory discrimination, yet the brain must balance specificity and generalization, especially in variable environments. To investigate how variability shapes perceptual learning, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects performed an orientation discrimination task with low or high task-irrelevant variability in spatial frequency. Behaviorally, both training regimes improved performance, but only high variability training enabled transfer to a novel location. Retinotopic orientation representations in early visual areas changed similarly across groups, indicating that variability does not alter local sensory representations. In contrast, functional connectivity differed: low variability training enhanced task-dependent coupling between the intraparietal sulcus and V2, while high variability training differentially affected connectivity with hV4. These results support a \"sweet spot\" model of perceptual learning, in which the locus of learning flexibly depends on the training environment. But rather than modifying sensory representations, variability reconfigures network-level readout, enabling specific or generalizable improvements in perception.",

      "title": "A Concept-Driven Disentanglement Framework for Interpretable Graph Neural Networks in Structure-Function Coupling",
      "content": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting brain functional connectivity (FC) from structural connectivity (SC), yet their \"black-box\" nature limits interpretability and scientific utility. We present a concept-driven disentanglement framework that builds inherently interpretable GNNs for quantitative hypothesis testing of structure-function relationships. The framework employs an ensemble of GNN branches, each architecturally biased to learn from a predefined structural concept (e.g., strong vs. weak connections) by processing a filtered version of the SC graph. This design enforces verifiably disentangled node embeddings, ensuring each branch captures a distinct structural feature. Using SHAP (Shapley additive explanations), we quantify the predictive contribution of each concept and assess its statistical significance against null distributions. Our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for FC, achieving a group-level correlation coefficient of 0.91 on a public human connectome dataset, while simultaneously yielding interpretable neuroscientific insights. This interpretable-by-design methodology bridges the gap between predictive power and scientific transparency, enabling deep learning models to provide mechanistic insights into the brain's network organization.",

      "title": "Post-weaning social isolation impairs the orbitofrontal cortical circuit subserving contagious pain and prosocial behaviors",
      "content": "Empathic behaviors are sensitive to environmental factors like post-weaning social isolation (SI), yet the mechanisms by which SI affects empathy remain unclear. Here, we show that mice subjected to SI exhibit marked impairments in contagious pain and prosocial behaviors, including allo-grooming and allo-licking toward cagemates experiencing inflammatory pain. Mechanistically, we identify the glutamatergic projection from the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM) to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as critical for these empathy-like responses. SI induces hypoexcitability of OFC glutamatergic neurons and attenuates excitatory synaptic transmission within the VM[-&gt;]OFC pathway. Remarkably, chemogenetic activation of OFC neurons or the VM[-&gt;]OFC projection restores empathic behaviors in SI mice. Furthermore, we uncover a molecular basis for SI-induced OFC hypoexcitability: the downregulation of Grik3, encoding a kainate-type glutamate receptor subunit. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized thalamocortical mechanism through which early-life social deprivation disrupts empathic behaviors, offering insights into the underpinnings of social-affective dysfunction.",

      "title": "Distributed fMRI patterns coupled to low-frequency cardiorespiratory dynamics provide markers of aging",
      "content": "How aging affects brain-body connections can be investigated through changes in the coupling between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals and bodily autonomic processes across the adult lifespan. Recent studies using univariate approaches have identified age-related changes in the association between fMRI signals from multiple individual brain regions and low-frequency respiratory and cardiac activity. Here, we investigate if whole-brain spatial fMRI patterns associated with low-frequency physiological processes (heart rate and respiratory volume fluctuations) present generalizable changes with age. Data from human participants of both sexes are included in the analysis. We find that chronological age can be predicted statistically beyond chance from patterns of low-frequency fMRI-physiology coupling, even after accounting for individual differences in physiological signal characteristics and brain anatomy. Notably, brain areas implicated in central autonomic regulation, including nodes within salience and ventral attention networks (e.g., insula and middle cingulate cortex), are amongst the strongest contributors to age prediction. Further, we observe that after removing physiological effects from fMRI data, the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability is still a reliable indicator of age. Together, these findings underscore the close integration between brain and body physiology, and highlight this interaction as a potential biomarker of the aging process.",

      "title": "An fMRI study of composition in noun and verb phrases",
      "content": "How do the language areas of the human brain combine multiple words into meaningful phrases and sentences remains ill-understood. Here, to address this question, we determined the response profile of temporal and inferior frontal language areas to the composition of up to four words into phrases. We tested whether brain activity increases with the number of merged words, and whether this profile differs for noun and verb phrases. To this aim, we used fMRI to quantify the brain responses to individual noun and verb phrases of varying length and to tightly matched word lists. Increasing phrase length was associated to an increase in activation in all regions of the temporo-frontal language network. The effect was more pronounced for phrases built around verbs than for phrases built around nouns, suggesting that verbs involve a more complex syntactic tree structure than nouns. Even with word lists, several regions, notably the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis and opercularis and the posterior superior temporal sulcus showed clear increases in activity with the length of sequences, although the words could not be merged into phrases. By contrast, other regions (IFG pars orbitalis, anterior temporal lobe, temporo-parietal junction) did not react to scrambled word lists. Those different functional response profiles inform theories of how composition is implemented in the human brain.",

      "title": "Residual photoreceptors affect the response of a degenerate retina to electrical stimulation",
      "content": "Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) implanted with the PRIMA photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis demonstrated letter acuity closely matching the device's 100 {micro}m pixel size. Improving visual acuity requires smaller pixels, which, in turn, require relaxation of electric field confinement to maintain effective stimulation of bipolar cells. Eliminating local return electrodes broadens the electric field but may inadvertently engage residual photoreceptors adjacent to the implant, thereby altering electrically evoked visual percepts. Here we quantify the contribution of residual photoreceptors to electrically evoked retinal responses across various implant configurations. Monopolar photovoltaic arrays with 20 {micro}m pixels and bipolar arrays with 100 {micro}m pixels were implanted subretinally in Long Evans rats, resulting in local degeneration of photoreceptors directly above the device. Responses were compared with those obtained in RCS rats, which lack functional photoreceptors. Implants were activated by patterns of 880 nm laser at pulse durations varying from 0.5 to 10 ms. Visually evoked potentials were measured in scotopic and photopic conditions, with and without the intravitreal application of mGluR6 agonist L-AP4 to block photoreceptor-driven ON pathways. Experimental thresholds were interpreted using a computational model of retinal network activation in distinct electric field geometries. In locally degenerate retina stimulated with monopolar arrays, blocking photoreceptor input yielded a rheobase (0.06 mW/mm2) and chronaxie (~3 ms) of the stimulation threshold, matching that measured in fully degenerate RCS retina, indicating direct activation of bipolar cells. In contrast, when photoreceptor input was intact, stimulation thresholds decreased significantly, and dark adaptation further modulated the threshold in a pulse-duration dependent manner. Bipolar arrays provided identical thresholds in locally degenerate and fully degenerate retina (0.2 mW/mm2) when stimulation was confined to the implant center; however, shifting stimulation to the implant's edge lowered the thresholds, revealing a contribution from adjacent photoreceptors. These findings demonstrate that residual photoreceptors can substantially influence responses evoked by subretinal prostheses in a degenerate retina, with direct consequences for perceptual uniformity in patients, such as edge brightening. These results provide guidance for design of the next-generation higher-resolution implants, supporting the use of local return electrodes to maximize resolution while minimizing the effect of photoreceptors in clinical applications.",

      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

These discrepancies underscore the need for a systematic, quantitative synthesis of existing data to clarify the impact of DBS across different motor domains.ObjectiveTo systematically evaluate the effects of DBS on motor symptoms in PD by analyzing UPDRS-III scores and conducting subgroup analyses based on stimulation target, stimulation type, and medication status.MethodsA literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies on clinical trials and observational studies reporting pre- and post-DBS motor assessments in PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science from inception to 15 December 2024.ResultsA total of 35 studies comprising 1,082 PD patients were included. The pooled analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall UPDRS-III scores post-DBS (WMD: = \u22121.09, 95% CI: \u22121.32 to \u22120.87, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Subgroup analyses showed consistent improvements across tremor, rigidity, akinesia, bradykinesia, dyskinesia, and axial symptoms, regardless of stimulation target or medication state. UPDRS Part IV scores also significantly improved, reflecting reduced motor complications. However, speech function remained unchanged, and UPDRS Part I scores initially showed no significant improvement, though significance emerged after removing sources of heterogeneity.ConclusionDBS significantly improves overall motor function, particularly tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, its effects on gait and speech remain inconsistent, which shows the need for further research to refine patient selection and optimize stimulation parameters. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic impact of DBS in PD management.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe application of motor imagery in human\u2013computer interaction and rehabilitative medicine has attracted growing attention due to recent advances in brain\u2013computer interface technologies. However, traditional EEG decoding paradigms based on fixed frequency\u2013band segmentation often exhibit limited performance because they fail to capture individual variability in brain rhythms.MethodsThis work proposes an adaptive method that integrates the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) with Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to optimize sub\u2013band segmentation for motor imagery EEG decoding. SSA adaptively searches for optimal sub\u2013band boundaries, enabling individualized frequency\u2013band selection.ResultsExperiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset under a cross\u2013session evaluation protocol (training on session T, testing on session E) demonstrated that SSA\u2013FBCSP effectively improves frequency\u2013band adaptability. The SSA\u2013FBCSP approach was further combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and k\u2013Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifiers to evaluate the influence of different downstream classifiers.ConclusionAmong them, SSA\u2013FBCSP\u2013LDA achieved the best performance, outperforming the conventional uniform sub\u2013band approach by 21.76% and reaching an average accuracy of 89.92%. The adaptively selected sub\u2013bands closely matched the ERD/ERS distribution, confirming the method\u2019s effectiveness in frequency\u2013band optimization. Compared with recent deep\u2013learning\u2013based MI\u2013EEG models, the proposed technique offers a balance of accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency, providing a promising direction for personalized brain\u2013computer interface systems.",

      "content": "BackgroundChinese zither music relies on culturally specific microtones (e. g., FA+ and TI\u2013) that differ from Western equal temperament, yet prolonged exposure to standardized tuning often leads to the erosion of these traditional intonation practices. While embodied cognition theory emphasizes the role of sensorimotor integration in learning, its application to the acquisition of non-fixed pitch systems in intangible cultural heritage music remains underexplored.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether a structured auditory-vocal embodied training protocol\u2014integrating listening, vocal imitation, and metaphoric gestures\u2014could enhance zither learners' accuracy in producing traditional microtones, and to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of embodied cognition theory in sustaining culturally authentic musical intonation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design was employed with 63 intermediate-level zither students. Participants were assigned to an experimental group, which completed a 1-week auditory-vocal-gestural training program, or a control group, which continued regular practice without multimodal integration. Pitch accuracy on two critical tones (FA+ and TI\u2013) was assessed through pre- and post-tests.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Chinese-style pitch accuracy compared to the control group, along with a marked shift in intonation perception away from equal-tempered biases.ConclusionThe findings indicate that multisensory embodied training, grounded in the principles of perceptual-motor coupling and gestural simulation, effectively promotes the internalization of traditional microtonal intonation.

      "title": "Sulfate reducing bacteria induce \u03b1-synuclein in intestinal and neuronal cells and tissues and inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase in neuronal cells",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD), a synucleopathy characterized by the presence of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates in the brain, is thought to originate in the intestine. Desulfovibrio, resident gut sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), usually found in very low numbers in a healthy gut, are found in higher numbers in PD. In a recent study, a separate group demonstrated that Desulfovibrio isolated from both PD patients and healthy subjects were fed to C. elegans and were found to increase \u03b1-syn aggregates in the head region of the worms. How these bacteria induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain through the gut remain unknown. We tested whether Desulfovibrio induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in the intestinal cells and triggered \u03b1-syn secretion from these cells into the growth medium and whether this growth medium (devoid of bacteria) further induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio directly induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neuronal cells and inhibited protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key dopamine-producing enzyme. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio increased \u03b1-syn levels in intestine, plasma, and in brain in mice.MethodsEnteroendocrine STC-1 and neuronal SH-Sy5y cells were infected with Desulfovibriovulgaris (DSV). We measured \u03b1-syn aggregation by immunofluorescence. \u03b1-syn levels in cell culture supernatant (sup), tissues, and plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein expression of TH and \u03b1-syn was analyzed by Western blot.ResultsWe found that DSV increased the number of STC-1cells with \u03b1-syn aggregates and also induced \u03b1-syn expression in these cells. Sup from DSV-infected STC-1 had higher \u03b1-syn levels compared to control uninfected sup and could induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in SH-Sy5y. DSV also directly induced a syn aggregates and inhibited TH in SH-Sy5y. DSV-gavaged mice had higher levels of \u03b1-syn in the duodenum, plasma, and in brain and also showed a decreasing trend in TH expression in the brain.ConclusionThus, our findings provide a gut-to-brain link tied to the ability of SRB in the gut-to increase expression, aggregation and spread of \u03b1-syn and decrease of TH in PD.",

      "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",

      "title": "Automated brain atrophy quantification from clinical MRI predicts early neurological deterioration in anterior choroidal artery territory infarction",
      "content": "BackgroundEarly neurological deterioration (END) occurs in 43%\u201360% of patients with anterior choroidal artery (AChA) territory infarction. While brain atrophy serves as an imaging biomarker of diminished brain reserve capacity and may influence stroke outcomes, its predictive value for END in AChA infarction remains unclear.MethodsThis dual-center retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with acute AChA territory infarction admitted to two Chinese stroke centers between September 2018 and September 2024. Clinical T1-weighted images were reconstructed into standardized high-resolution images using the SynthSR deep learning algorithm, followed by fully automated brain tissue segmentation via AssemblyNet. We calculated gray matter fraction (GMF), white matter fraction (WMF), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), and cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) to quantify brain atrophy severity. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to assess associations between brain atrophy metrics and END.ResultsAmong 206 enrolled patients, 78 (37.86%) developed END. Patients with END demonstrated significantly greater brain atrophy: GMF (P < 0.001), WMF (P < 0.001), and BPF (P < 0.001) were all significantly reduced, while CSFF was correspondingly elevated (P < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, each 0.01-unit increase in WMF was associated with a 58% reduction in END risk (P < 0.001); each 0.01-unit increase in BPF corresponded to a 32% risk reduction (P = 0.002); and each 0.01-unit increase in CSFF was associated with a 52% increase in risk (P < 0.001). Quartile analysis confirmed dose-response relationships: the highest quartiles of WMF and BPF were associated with 91% and 74% reductions in END risk, respectively, while the highest CSFF quartile conferred a 6.2-fold increased risk. RCS analysis confirmed significant linear dose-response relationships between both BPF and CSFF with END (both P-non-linear > 0.05).ConclusionAutomated brain atrophy quantification based on routine clinical MRI can independently predict END risk in patients with AChA infarction, providing a feasible imaging biomarker for this high-risk stroke population and facilitating early risk stratification and treatment optimization.",
