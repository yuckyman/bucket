      "title": "ATAD1 Overexpression Enhances Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Function in Zellweger Syndrome Disorder Models",
      "content": "Zellweger Spectrum Disorders (ZSDs) are caused by mutations in any of the different peroxin (PEX) genes, which are essential for peroxisome biogenesis and function. Clinical features of ZSDs include seizures, leukodystrophy, renal and liver dysfunction, skeletal abnormalities, and they usually result in death during infancy or early childhood. There are no treatments for ZSDs, and their rarity, the large size of the PEX genes, and the numerous different genes, has impaired therapeutic development. We previously demonstrated that ATAD1, a mitochondrial protein quality control chaperone, could correct both mitochondrial and peroxisomal phenotypes in PEX3 patient fibroblasts. In this study, we investigated whether overexpressing ATAD1 could provide similar benefits in PEX1 and PEX6 patient cell lines, which account for over 70% of ZSD cases. We used established PEX6-/- HEK293 cells, patient-derived fibroblasts with pathogenic PEX1 mutations, and newly created zebrafish mutants. Lipidomic profiling of the cell lines demonstrated widespread dysregulation, including accumulation of lysophosphatidylcholines with very-long-chain fatty acids, depletion of plasmalogens and cholesteryl esters containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, and a decrease in cardiolipins. Overexpressing ATAD1 partly corrected these imbalances, including normalizing VLCFA metabolism in PEX1 fibroblasts and restoring plasmalogens and cardiolipins in PEX6-deficient cells. Mitochondrial function analysis (Seahorse XF) showed that ATAD1 increased basal and ATP-linked respiration in both PEX1- and PEX6-deficient cells, sometimes surpassing the effects of PEX gene re-expression. ATAD1 increased peroxisome numbers in both PEX6 and PEX1 cells. Zebrafish Pex1 mutants exhibited impaired maximal respiration despite normal basal activity, confirming mitochondrial vulnerability in vivo. These findings further confirm a role for ATAD1 as a modifier that improves lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and peroxisome abundance that could function across multiple ZSDs.",

      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",
