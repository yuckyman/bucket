      "content": "Parabrachial nucleus (PBN) neurons expressing Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) modulate fear- and anxiety-like behavior. It is unknown if PBN(CGRP) neurons play a role in anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol or after repeated stress. First, to investigate the anxiogenic role of activating PBN(CGRP) neurons in naive conditions, CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM3D(Gq) DREADDs in the PBN were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM). PBN(CGRP) neurons drive phasic activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that synchronizes to anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, a transsynaptic anterograde AAV-based strategy was used in C57BL/6J female and male mice to activate BNST neurons innervated by the PBN projections (BNSTPBN) during EPM. Additionally, PBN(CGRP) neurons and CGRP-innervated BNST cells were measured in experimentally-naive CGRP-DTRGFP female and male mice, to investigate baseline sex-differences. Next, to investigate the impact of PBN(CGRP) inhibition on anxiety-like behavior following chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE), CalcaCRE female and male mice expressing CRE-dependent hM4D(Gi) DREADDs in the PBN were tested in EPM during acute withdrawal. Additionally, mice were exposed to repeated forced swim stress (FSS) paired with PBN(CGRP) inhibition followed by testing in the novelty suppressed feeding task (NSFT), to investigate the role of PBN(CGRP) on anxiety-like behavior after stress in prolonged withdrawal. Activating PBN(CGRP) or BNSTPBN neurons did not change behavior in EPM in either sex. Total PBN(CGRP) and CGRP-innervated BNST cells did not differ between females and males. In acute withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons decreased time in the open arm and increased time in the closed arm selectively in females. In prolonged withdrawal, inhibiting PBN(CGRP) neurons during FSS did not affect immobility in either sex, but did subsequently decrease approach frequency and average speed selectively in males. Altogether, the data report the anxiogenic effect of manipulating PBN(CGRP) neurons is stress and sex-specific during alcohol withdrawal.",

      "title": "Contralesional activity reflects compensation, while brainstem detour pathways support skilled motor recovery after stroke",
      "content": "Large strokes frequently result in lasting motor deficits and trigger extensive reorganization within the brain and spinal cord. Altered neuronal activity in the contralesional hemisphere has been documented in both humans and rodent models, yet its role in functional recovery versus maladaptation remains unresolved. Here, we used chronic wide-field calcium imaging to monitor bilateral cortical activity in mice performing a skilled reach-to-grasp task before and days to weeks after stroke. Strokes produced persistent fine motor impairments, which were only partly alleviated by intensive rehabilitative training. While cortical activity was in particular suppressed in the ipsilesional cortex after stroke, training promoted sustained increases in contralesional sensorimotor activity. However, ridge regression analysis of neural and behavioral data indicated that this activity largely reflected compensatory use of the intact paw rather than recovery of the impaired forelimb. Axonal tracing nevertheless revealed enhanced projections from contralesional motor cortex to ipsilesional brainstem nuclei - including the midbrain and pontine reticular nucleus - specifically in trained animals. These findings identify a rehabilitation-induced corticofugal pathway supporting motor recovery, highlighting a target for neuromodulation strategies in chronic post-stroke impairment.",

      "title": "Fus depleted oligodendrocytes reduce neuronal damage and attenuate AD progression in the AppNL-G-F mouse",
      "content": "Oligodendrocytes (OL) and myelin abnormalities have emerged as important contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer Disease (AD). OL maintain neuronal health through myelin axon interactions and by supplying neurotrophic and metabolic support. To gain insight on how OL and myelin may improve neuronal deficits associated with AD, we have generated a novel mouse model (AD/cKO) by crossing the AppNL-G-F mouse which carries three human AD mutations in the mouse App gene with the FusOLcKO which has thicker myelin associated with greater cholesterol biosynthesis. The spatial working memory deficits manifested by the aged AD mouse were fully rescued by the FusOLcKO. This outcome was associated with reduced neuronal oxidative damage, preserved presynaptic structures at the plaque niches and a shift in microglia state at the niches in both hippocampus and cortex. In contrast, plaque burden and microglia density were decreased in the hippocampus but not in cortex, uncoupling the neuronal and microglia effects from the amyloid burden. Single cell transcriptomics of AD/cKO hippocampal OL revealed upregulation of energy metabolism and antioxidant genes, suggesting a role of OL enhanced energy metabolism in protecting neurons and affecting microglia state in AD pathology.",

      "title": "A mouse model of classical trigeminal neuralgia via intradural compression of the trigeminal nerve",
      "content": "Introduction: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a debilitating orofacial pain condition that adversely affects quality of life. Although heterogeneous, the most common form of TN is classical TN, characterized by paroxysmal bouts of pain in response to otherwise innocuous stimuli. It is believed that classical TN results from neurovascular compression of the trigeminal nerve. However, the underlying pathophysiology of TN is not well understood, thus limiting the development of targeted therapies. Current animal models lack translational relevance, particularly in their inability to replicate intradural nerve root compression, a core anatomic component of TN. Methods: We developed a TN mouse model that achieves intradural nerve root compression via a retro-orbital approach confirmed by anatomic dissection and magnetic resonance imaging. To assess behavioral outcomes, we measured orofacial pain through facial wiping and interaction with a reward stimulus. Pharmacological responsiveness was tested using carbamazepine administration. Mechanistic studies included calcium imaging of trigeminal ganglia (TG), electrophysiologic recordings to measure resting membrane potential and rheobase, and immunohistochemical analysis of the TG. Results: The model elicited orofacial neuropathic pain, substantiated by increased facial wiping and reduced interaction with a reward stimulus, behaviors that suggest both spontaneous and evoked pain. Carbamazepine attenuated these behaviors, suggesting pharmacologic relevance to current TN treatment. Calcium imaging showed heightened spontaneous activity in the TG, and electrophysiologic recordings revealed an increased resting membrane potential and a reduced rheobase. Finally, immunohistochemical studies showed infiltration of CD45+ cells, demyelination and an increase in CGRP expression in the TG, supporting the presence of neuroinflammation after nerve root compression.",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "title": "The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test for adults: A refined version in Spanish.",
      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
