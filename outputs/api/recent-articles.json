      "title": "New gait performance indices and cognitive functions: a pilot study on correlation in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and involves impairment of both motor and cognitive functions, significantly affecting the quality of walking and consequently the quality of life of people affected by this disease. This study analyzed the relationship between gait alterations and cognitive deterioration, using validated clinical tests and an innovative indicator, the \u03c6-bonacci gait number, which quantifies gait harmonicity, symmetry, and consistency. Kinematic data collected during the 6-Minute Walk test on 19 people with PD (pwPD) and 15 healthy adults were analyzed. The results highlighted a significant negative correlation between gait harmonicity and cognitive performance (\u03c6-bonacci gait number\u2014Time Up and Go Dual Task; r\u202f=\u202f0.797, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Finally, mediation analysis showed that global cognitive function (MoCA) indirectly influences gait harmonicity through TUG-DT. The results suggest that gait in pwPD is strongly modulated by executive-attentional functions, supporting its cognitive modulation rather than a purely automatic nature. This study allowed to explore the complex relationship between cognitive functions and the motor system, deepening how these interactions influence and refine motor behavior. Therefore, rehabilitation programs combining motor exercises and cognitive training could be more effective in improving gait quality, reducing the risk of falls, and improving person\u2019s quality of life.",

      "title": "An Autophagy-Inducing Compound Reduces Tau Pathology, Microglia Reactivity, and Rescues Working Memory in 3xTg AD Mice",
      "content": "Background Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics have validated the use of amyloid beta (A{beta})-clearing antibodies, which reduce A{beta} pathology but leave other disease hallmarks largely unaddressed. Since AD involves multiple pathological processes, additional strategies are needed to target complementary mechanisms. One such target is autophagy, a lysosomal mediated degradation pathway essential for cellular homeostasis that removes toxic protein aggregates and damaged organelles. This process is implicated in AD, as impaired lysosomal function promotes A{beta} and tau accumulation. Our laboratory recently identified a novel natural mitophagy-inducing compound (MIC) that may serve as a therapeutic intervention for AD. Methods We evaluated the effects of MIC in aged 3xTgAD mice, a transgenic model displaying both A{beta} and tau pathology. Mice received either standard diet or diet containing MIC beginning at age 4 months until 20 months on alternating weeks. Age-matched non-transgenic (NonTg) controls were included under standard and MIC-supplemented diets to assess compound effects during normal aging. Neuropathological changes were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for A{beta}, phosphorylated tau (pTau), and microglial reactivity. Cognitive performance was evaluated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) to assess spatial learning and memory and the Y-maze to measure working memory. Results At 20 months of age, our neuropathological assessment showed that 3xTgAD mice fed an MIC-supplemented diet had a significant reduction in pTau accumulation and microglial reactivity, although A{beta} burden remained unchanged. At 15 months, MIC diet also improved spatial learning and memory in aged NonTg controls but not in 3xTgAD mice. However, in younger 8-month-old 3xTgAD mice, MIC restored working memory performance to NonTg levels, indicating an age-dependent therapeutic response. Conclusion MIC emerges as a potential modulator of tau pathology and neuroinflammation. As a naturally derived compound, MIC offers potential for combination therapy with FDA-approved A{beta}-clearing antibodies, enabling a multimodal approach to AD treatment that addresses amyloid, tau, and microglia-related pathology.",

      "title": "Acetylcholine reflects uncertainty during hidden state inference",
      "content": "To act adaptively, animals must infer features of the environment that cannot be observed directly, such as which option is currently rewarding, or which context they are in. These internal estimates, known as hidden states, guide behaviour but are inherently uncertain. Theoretical models propose that efficient inference requires tracking both the most likely state and the uncertainty of that estimate. While neural representations of state identity have been described in cortical and hippocampal circuits, the origin of uncertainty signals remains unclear. Here we show that acetylcholine (ACh) reflects this uncertainty during hidden state inference. Using fibre photometry in mice performing a probabilistic two-armed bandit task, we found that ACh release in medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus tracked recent omission history and predicted whether animals would switch choice on the next trial. Blocking muscarinic receptors with scopolamine selectively impaired loss-driven switching without affecting stable performance. A hidden-state inference model in which ACh modulated how uncertainty from past experience shaped future beliefs reproduced both the physiological and behavioural effects, whereas alternative models did not. These results identify ACh as a neuromodulatory signal reflecting uncertainty during hidden-state inference, linking theoretical models of belief updating to their biological implementation in the mammalian brain.",

      "title": "FGF13 is not secreted from neurons",
      "content": "FGF13, a noncanonical fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and member of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor (FHF) subset, lacks a signal sequence and was previously reported to remain intracellular, where it regulates voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) at least in part through direct interaction with the cytoplasmic C-terminus of VGSCs. Recent reports suggest that FGF13 is secreted and regulates neuronal VGSCs through interactions with extracellular domains of integral plasma membrane proteins, yet supportive data are limited. Using rigorous positive and negative controls, we show that transfected FGF13 is not secreted from cultured cells in a heterologous expression system nor is endogenous FGF13 secreted from cultured neurons. Further, employing multiple unbiased screens including proximity protein proteomics, our results suggest FGF13 remains within membranes and is unavailable to interact directly with extracellular protein domains.",

      "title": "Early impairment in dentate pattern separation in a rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy.",
      "content": "The dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation utilizes sparse neural coding to support memory formation. In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), the dentate undergoes extensive restructuring, including loss of local inhibition. It is unknown how circuit changes impact dentate network computations in awake behaving animals. Here we perform high-density tetrode recordings from the dentate in male rats treated with systemic kainic acid (KA) to induce TLE. In KA-treated rats, dentate spatial representations were less precise at the single neuron level, however the stability of the spatial code in representing repeated visits to the same location was retained at the population level. Despite spared spatial representation, the network computations for pattern separation were disrupted. The reorganized dentate network in KA-treated rats generated less distinct population activity patterns for different environments, specifically as a result of impaired rate-remapping. Changes in network computations paralleled impairments in a dentate-dependent memory task, potentially providing a link between altered pattern separation and behavioral discrimination. These deficits were present in animals with confirmed dentate circuit reorganization that had not yet developed spontaneous seizures - suggesting that the dentate network changes underlying altered rate-remapping and impaired dentate-dependent memory occur early in epileptogenesis.",

      "title": "Causal role of the individual alpha phase in multisensory perception",
      "content": "The phase of alpha oscillations is proposed to reflect perceptual cycles. Yet, human EEG/MEG studies have yielded inconsistent results, perhaps because they used correlative approaches that did not consider causal phase-perception relationships. In a multi-day computational EEG study, we developed the neurobehavioral link function (NBLF) as a new approach to model individual sinusoidal relationships between the alpha phase and multisensory perception and to test for causality. Rhythmic 10 Hz visual stimulation entrained the alpha phase at 0 degree or 180 degree relative to audiovisual target onset. Entrainment effects on multisensory integration only emerged when individual NBLFs, which were related to alpha phase coupling between early audio-visual cortices, were included in the analysis. A follow-up psychophysical experiment confirmed individual phase-dependent effects at 5 and 10 Hz, but not 15 Hz. Our results suggest that the individual alpha phase causally modulates perceptual cycles in multisensory integration and advocate for personalized, phase-targeting strategies in neurotechnologies.",

Considering the gap in understanding the relationship between cognitive impairments in Parkinson\u2019s disease and executive function, this study aimed to investigate the association between three cognitive statutes: normal cognition condition (PD-NCC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and mild dementia (PDD), and the performance of the Anterior Attentional System in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 96 participants with Parkinson\u2019s disease (45 with PD-NCC, 39 with PD-MCI, and 12 with PDD) and 46 participants from control group, recruited between 2020 and 2023. MDS-UPDRS was used during the neurological examination. To assess cognitive status, we used: Mini-Mental State Examination, Californian Verbal Learning Test, Digit Span Test, Rey Complex Figure, and Trail Making Test (A and B form). The ROtman Baycrest Battery was employed to evaluate the Anterior Attentional System.ResultsParticipants with PDD exhibited significant impairments in the Anterior Attentional System. Energization impairment was observed in PD-MCI and PDD, though mildly. Monitoring and task-setting processes were notably impaired only in individuals with PDD, while these functions remained intact in those with PD-NCC and PD-MCI.ConclusionThe Anterior Attentional System is well-preserved in PD-NCC and PD-MCI however notably disturbed in PDD.",

      "content": "IntroductionStandardized treadmill-based balance disturbances have potential to improve assessments of dynamic balance control in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Here we examined the validity of a step threshold task to measure dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease.MethodsThirty-nine participants with idiopathic Parkinson\u2019s disease underwent clinical testing and performed a dynamic balance assessment both OFF and ON dopaminergic medication. For the assessment, participants were instructed to avoid stepping in response to progressively larger postural perturbations applied via treadmill translations. The step threshold was defined as the perturbation magnitude that resulted in a stepping response on four consecutive trials. Validity was assessed by correlating medication-mediated changes in gold standard clinical measures and medication-mediated changes in stepping.ResultsMedication-mediated changes in step threshold correlated with changes in MDS-UPDRS part III (p < 0.01), with change in MDS-UPDRS 3.12 postural instability (p < 0.05), and with measures of executive function: CPT-3 Omission T-score (p = 0.013), the CPT-3 Commission T-score (p = 0.019), and the CPT-3 Variability T-score (p = 0.040).DiscussionOur results validate step threshold task as a measure of dynamic balance control in patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Correlations with gold standard assessments of motor and executive function suggest that the step threshold task can serve as a comprehensive measure of dynamic balance control.",

We believe that there is a need to advance our knowledge of this subject, for which we have set ourselves the following objectives: (1) to test whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions influence the motor performance of children with DCD; (2) to check whether these effects persist over time; and (3) whether the effects of aquatic and land-based interventions bring motor performance values closer together between children with DCD and those with typical development.Methods76 children aged between 6 and 10 years old were divided into four groups, control developmental coordination disorder (C-DCD); control typical development (C-TD); experimental terrestrial developmental coordination disorder (T-DCD); and experimental aquatic developmental coordination disorder (A-DCD). Due to some dropouts, the final sample consisted of 66 children, 27 girls and 39 boys. The groups of children with DCD were randomized according to their initial total score on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Test - second edition (MABC-2). The analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) carried out in the pre-test showed similarity between the means of the DCD groups (C-DCD, T-DCD and A-DCD), which ensured that these groups started from the same performance level. The interventions lasted 4.5 months (18 weeks) with three sessions a week, totaling 54 sessions of 60 min each. The experimental groups took part in the same intervention protocol, with the only difference being the environment (A-DCD = aquatic environment; T-DCD = terrestrial environment).ResultsAnalysis of the results revealed no significant effect for the group and time point interaction, F(6, 133) = 1.36, p = 0.235. However, effects were detected for group, F(2, 54.7) = 3.78, p < 0.05, and for time point F(3, 131) = 22.91, p < 0.001. The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test found a difference between the T-DCD and C-DCD groups (p < 0.05; independent-groups effect size (dig = 0.85; dig = 0.87; dig = 0.92). For time point, differences were found between the pre-test and the other time points [post-intervention (repeated measures effect size) (dR,M = 1.14), 3 months post-test (dR,M = 1.51) and 6 months post-test (dR,M = 2.2)] with a significance level of p < 0.001. For the A-DCD group there was no statistically significant difference in relation to either the C-DCD or T-DCD group, but we did observe large effect size values [pre-test and post-test (dR,M = 1.14), pre-test and 3 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.29) and pre-test and 6 months-post-test (dR,M = 1.61)]. Regarding the analysis of the Z score, the results indicated an interaction effect for the group and time point F(6, 132) = 2.30, p = 0.038. This difference was located by post hoc between the C-DCD group and the A-DCD (p < 0.05; independent groups pre-test - post-test effect size (digpp = 1.72) and dig = 0.79) and T-DCD (p < 0.05 ES digpp = 1.65 and dig = 0.79) groups at 6 months-post-test.ConclusionWe conclude that both aquatic and terrestrial interventions have positive effects on the motor performance of children with DCD, that these effects are maintained over time but also bring the motor performance of children with DCD closer to that of children with typical development.",

      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "content": "Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) represents a critical prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet effective therapeutic interventions to prevent or delay this conversion remain an unmet clinical need. Growing evidence implicates dysregulation of the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA)-a complex bidirectional communication network involving neural, immune, and endocrine pathways-in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. This perspective proposes that acupuncture, as a multi-target therapeutic approach, may modulate gut microbiota composition and restore MGBA homeostasis, thereby potentially decelerating the progression from aMCI to AD. A systematic understanding of the precise mechanisms through which acupuncture influences the MGBA carries substantial implications for both neuroscience and clinical practice. Future investigations should prioritize the elucidation of these mechanisms and the generation of robust clinical evidence through well-controlled experimental designs.",

      "title": "Comparative efficacy and safety of symptomatic therapy and disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer\u2019s disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundThe management of Alzheimer\u2019s disease has shifted toward disease-modifying therapies aimed at delaying disease progression rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. This study summarizes the latest evidence regarding the benefits and harms of anti-Alzheimer\u2019s disease drugs.MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science databases, and other sources up to April 2025. Two researchers independently reviewed the literature and analyzed the data. A network meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.3 and Stata version 18.0 to calculate mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for direct and indirect comparisons. Treatment efficacy was evaluated using the Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA). Bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool version 2.0, and publication bias was analyzed with funnel plots.ResultsThe network meta-analysis included 23 randomized controlled trials with 16,010 participants, evaluating nine pharmacological interventions ranging from traditional symptomatic therapies to four United States Food and Drug Administration- and National Medical Products Administration-approved disease-modifying therapies, notably anti-amyloid beta monoclonal antibodies. Aducanumab significantly improved ADAS-cog scores compared with placebo (MD -5.97, 95%CI -10.33, \u22121.61; SUCRA: 93.0%) and demonstrated notable improvements in ADCS-ADL scores (MD 4.99, 95%CI 2.27, 7.72; SUCRA: 98.6%). Memantine ranked highest for neuropsychiatric symptoms (SUCRA: 80.8%). Aducanumab also had the highest SUCRA for CDR-SB (91.5%) and showed moderate superiority in MMSE scores (MD 3.55, 95%CI 1.35, 5.75; SUCRA: 98.2%).ConclusionSymptomatic treatments, especially memantine for neuropsychiatric symptoms, remain effective. However, the network meta-analysis indicates that, for patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer\u2019s disease, aducanumab demonstrates the greatest potential for cognitive and clinical improvement (MMSE, ADAS-cog, ADCS-ADL), despite associated risks such as adverse events and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities linked to disease-modifying therapies. Lecanemab provides moderate benefits, while donanemab appears less effective. Thus, clinicians should apply disease-modifying therapies cautiously and individually, carefully balancing potential risks and benefits for each patient.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO [CRD42025637730], https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/.",

      "title": "Exploring The Interaction-Outcome Paradox: Seemingly Richer and More Self-Aware Interactions with LLMs May Not Yet Lead to Better Learning",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.09458v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the user interface for learning, moving from keyword search to natural language dialogue, their impact on educational outcomes remains unclear. We present a controlled study (N=20) that directly compares the learning interaction and outcomes between LLM and search-based interfaces. We found that although LLMs elicit richer and nuanced interactions from a learner, they do not produce broadly better learning outcomes. In this paper, we explore this the ``Interaction-Outcome Paradox.'' To explain this, we discuss the concept of a cognitive shift: the locus of student effort moves from finding and synthesizing disparate sources (search) to a more self-aware identification and articulation of their knowledge gaps and strategies to bridge those gaps (LLMs). This insight provides a new lens for evaluating educational technologies, suggesting that the future of learning tools lies not in simply enriching interaction, but in designing systems that scaffold productive cognitive work by leveraging this student expressiveness.",

      "title": "Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets",
      "content": "arXiv:2511.09454v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09394v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Artificial intelligence has shown promise in medical imaging, yet most existing systems lack flexibility, interpretability, and adaptability - challenges especially pronounced in ophthalmology, where diverse imaging modalities are essential. We present EyeAgent, the first agentic AI framework for comprehensive and interpretable clinical decision support in ophthalmology. Using a large language model (DeepSeek-V3) as its central reasoning engine, EyeAgent interprets user queries and dynamically orchestrates 53 validated ophthalmic tools across 23 imaging modalities for diverse tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, image/report generation, and quantitative analysis. Stepwise ablation analysis demonstrated a progressive improvement in diagnostic accuracy, rising from a baseline of 69.71% (using only 5 general tools) to 80.79% when the full suite of 53 specialized tools was integrated. In an expert rating study on 200 real-world clinical cases, EyeAgent achieved 93.7% tool selection accuracy and received expert ratings of more than 88% across accuracy, completeness, safety, reasoning, and interpretability. In human-AI collaboration, EyeAgent matched or exceeded the performance of senior ophthalmologists and, when used as an assistant, improved overall diagnostic accuracy by 18.51% and report quality scores by 19%, with the greatest benefit observed among junior ophthalmologists. These findings establish EyeAgent as a scalable and trustworthy AI framework for ophthalmology and provide a blueprint for modular, multimodal, and clinically aligned next-generation AI systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2511.09337v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility.",
