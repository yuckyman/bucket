      "title": "Lowering Barriers to CAD Adoption: A Comparative Study of Augmented Reality-Based CAD (AR-CAD) and a Traditional CAD tool",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.12146v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper presents a comparative user study between an Augmented Reality-based Computer-Aided Design (AR-CAD) system and a traditional computer-based CAD modeling software, SolidWorks. Twenty participants of varying skill levels performed 3D modeling tasks using both systems. The results showed that while the average task completion time is comparable for both groups, novice designers had a higher completion rate in AR-CAD than in the traditional CAD interface, and experienced designers had a similar completion rate in both systems. A statistical comparison of task completion rate, time, and NASA Task Load Index (TLX) showed that AR-CAD slightly reduced cognitive load while favoring a high task completion rate. Higher scores on the System Usability Scale (SUS) by novices indicated that AR-CAD was superior and worthwhile for reducing barriers to entering CAD. In contrast, the Traditional CAD interface was favored by experienced users for its advanced capabilities, while many viewed AR-CAD as a valid means for rapid concept development, education, and an initial critique of designs. This opens up the need for future research on the needed refinement of AR-CAD with a focus on high-precision input tools and its evaluation of complex design processes. This research highlights the potential for immersive interfaces to enhance design practice, bridging the gap between novice and experienced CAD users.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12113v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The landscape of interactive systems is shifting toward dynamic, generative experiences that empower users to explore and construct knowledge in real time. Yet, timelines -- a fundamental tool for representing historical and conceptual development -- remain largely static, limiting user agency and curiosity. We introduce the concept of a generative timeline: an AI-powered timeline that adapts to users' evolving questions by expanding or contracting in response to input. We instantiate this concept through KnowledgeTrail, a system that enables users to co-construct timelines of historical events and knowledge formation processes. Two user studies showed that KnowledgeTrail fosters curiosity-driven exploration, serendipitous discovery, and the ability to trace complex relationships between ideas and events, while citation features supported verification yet revealed fragile trust shaped by perceptions of source credibility. We contribute a vision for generative timelines as a new class of exploratory interface, along with design insights for balancing serendipity and credibility.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12081v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite growing interest in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) for mental well-being, prior work using immersive interventions to teach mental health skills has largely focused on calming or abstract settings. As a result, little is known about how realistic social simulation may better support the transfer and application of skills to in-person environments. In this work, we present a 14-day user study with 43-participants comparing an augmented reality intervention simulating a realistic contextual environment against a matched non-contextual control, applied to the public speaking context. We found that participants who practice mental health skills in the contextual environment showed significantly greater likelihood to apply self-care techniques and greater physiological stress reduction when using skills in mock in-person tasks. Overall, our work provides empirical evidence for the effects of realistic stressor simulation, and offers design implications for mental health technology that supports effective transfer of skills to the real-world.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.11999v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper extends the functionality of block ordering problems (such as Parsons problems and Proof Blocks) to include optional blocks. We detail the algorithms used to implement the optional block feature and present usage experiences from instructors who have integrated it into their curriculum. The optional blocks feature enables instructors to create more complex Parsons problems with multiple correct solutions utilizing omitted or optional blocks. This affords students a method to engage with questions that have several valid solutions composed of different answer components. Instructors can specify blocks with multiple mutually exclusive dependencies, which we represent using a multigraph structure. This multigraph is then collapsed into multiple directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), allowing us to reuse existing algorithms for grading block ordering problems represented as a DAG. We present potential use cases for this feature across various domains, including helping students learn Git workflows, shell command sequences, mathematical proofs, and Python programming concepts.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.11954v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Enterprise chatbots show promise in supporting knowledge workers in information synthesis tasks by retrieving context from large, heterogeneous databases before generating answers. However, when the retrieved context misaligns with user intentions, the chatbot often produces \"irrelevantly right\" responses that provide little value. In this work, we introduce VizCopilot, a prototype that incorporates visualization techniques to actively involve end-users in context alignment. By combining topic modeling with document visualization, VizCopilot enables human oversight and modification of retrieved context while keeping cognitive overhead manageable. We used VizCopilot as a design probe in a Research-through-Design study to evaluate the role of visualization in context alignment and to surface future design opportunities. Our findings show that visualization not only helps users detect and correct misaligned context but also encourages them to adapt their prompting strategies, enabling the system to retrieve more relevant context from the outset. At the same time, the study reveals limitations in verification support regarding close-reading and trust in AI summaries. We outline future directions for visualization-enhanced chatbots, focusing on personalization, proactivity, and sustainable human-AI collaboration.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.11941v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While bodies change over time and trends vary, most store-bought clothing comes in fixed sizes and styles and fails to adapt to these changes. Alterations can enable small changes to otherwise static garments, but these changes often require sewing and are non-reversible. We propose a modular approach to garment design that considers resizing, restyling, and reuse earlier in the design process. Our contributions include a compact set of modules and connectors that form the building blocks of modular garments, a method to decompose a garment into modules via integer linear programming, and a digital design tool that supports modular garment design and simulation. Our user evaluation suggests that our approach to modular design can support the creation of a wide range of garments and can help users transform them across sizes and styles while reusing the same building blocks.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.11927v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Line charts surface many features in time series data, from trends to periodicity to peaks and valleys. However, not every potentially important feature in the data may correspond to a visual feature which readers can detect or prioritize. In this study, we conducted a visual stenography task, where participants re-drew line charts to solicit information about the visual features they believed to be important. We systematically varied noise levels (SNR ~5-30 dB) across line charts to observe how visual clutter influences which features people prioritize in their sketches. We identified three key strategies that correlated with the noise present in the stimuli: the Replicator attempted to retain all major features of the line chart including noise; the Trend Keeper prioritized trends disregarding periodicity and peaks; and the De-noiser filtered out noise while preserving other features. Further, we found that participants tended to faithfully retain trends and peaks and valleys when these features were present, while periodicity and noise were represented in more qualitative or gestural ways: semantically rather than accurately. These results suggest a need to consider more flexible and human-centric ways of presenting, summarizing, pre-processing, or clustering time series data.",

We conduct a user study comparing three alternatives-aggregated, trellis, and spiral line charts against standard line charts on tasks involving trend identification, making predictions, and decision-making. We found aggregated charts performed similarly to standard charts and support more accurate trend recognition and prediction; trellis and spiral charts generally lag. We also examined the impact on decision-making via a trust game. The results showed similar trust in standard and aggregated charts, varied trust in spiral charts, and a lean toward distrust in trellis charts. These findings provide guidance for practitioners choosing visualization strategies for dense temporal data.",

Several benchmarks have been created to measure the performance of LLMs on this task. We present a longitudinal study comparing the feedback loop of an internal and external human annotator group for the complex annotation task of creating multi-turn RAG conversations for evaluating LLMs. We analyze the conversations produced by both groups and provide results of a survey comparing their experiences. Our study highlights the advantages of each annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and diversity. Further, we present guidance for how to best utilize two different population groups when performing annotation tasks, particularly when the task is complex.",

However, the standardized frameworks adopted by most applications often fail to cater to users with various psychological states and health conditions. This limitation arises primarily from the lack of personalization and adaptive content design. To address this, we propose MindfulVerse, an AI-Generated Content (AIGC)-driven application to create personalized and immersive mindfulness experiences. By developing a novel agent, the system can dynamically adjust the meditation content based on the ideas of individual users. Furthermore, we conducted exploratory user studies and comparative evaluations to assess the application scenarios and performance of our novel generative meditation tool in VR environments. The results of this user study indicate that generative meditation improves neural activation in self-regulation and shows a positive impact on emotional regulation and participation. Our approach offers a generative meditation procedure that provides users with an application that better suits their preferences and states.",

      "title": "The Algorithmic Regulator",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.10300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \\emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \\emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\\varnothing$, i.e., \\[ \\Delta = K\\big(O_{W,\\varnothing}\\big) - K\\big(O_{W,R}\\big) > 0. \\] We then prove that the larger $\\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\\Delta > 0$ yields \\[ \\Pr\\big((W,R)\\mid x\\big) \\le C\\,2^{\\,M(W{:}R)}\\,2^{-\\Delta}, \\] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \\emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \\emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \\emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12751v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background: Non-linear alterations in brain network connectivity may represent early neural signatures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in cognitively normal older adults. Understanding these changes and their cognitive relevance could provide sensitive biomarkers for early detection. Most prior studies recruited participants from memory clinics, often with subjective memory concerns, limiting generalizability.\n  Methods: We examined 14 large-scale functional brain networks in 968 cognitively normal older adults recruited from the community using resting-state functional MRI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers (amyloid-$\\beta$ 1-42 [A$\\beta$], total tau, phosphorylated tau 181), and neuropsychological assessments. Functional networks were identified using group independent component analysis.\n  Results: Inverted U-shaped associations between CSF A$\\beta$ and functional connectivity were observed in the precuneus network and ventral default mode network (DMN), but not in the dorsal DMN, indicating network-specific vulnerability to early amyloid pathology. Higher connectivity in A$\\beta$-related networks, including dorsal and ventral DMN, precuneus, and posterior salience networks, was associated with better visual memory, visuospatial, and executive performance. No significant relationships were observed between CSF tau and functional connectivity.\n  Conclusions: Using a large, community-based cohort, we demonstrate that non-linear alterations in functional connectivity occur in specific networks even during the asymptomatic phase of AD. Moreover, A$\\beta$-related network connectivity is cognitively relevant, highlighting functional brain networks as promising imaging markers for early detection and prognosis of AD.",

However, this causal view fails to explain misrepresentation, a phenomenon better handled by an informational view based on decodable content. This creates a tension: how does a system that abstracts away details still preserve the fine-grained information needed for downstream functions? We propose readout representation to resolve this, defining representation by the information recoverable from features rather than their causal origin. Empirically, we show that inputs can be accurately reconstructed even from heavily perturbed mid-level features, demonstrating that a single input corresponds to a broad, redundant region of feature space, challenging the causal mapping perspective. To quantify this property, we introduce representation size, a metric linked to model robustness and representational redundancy. Our framework offers a new lens for analyzing how both biological and artificial neural systems learn complex features while maintaining robust, information-rich representations of the world.",

      "title": "MAPS: Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies- A computational framework to align human and model explanations",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.12141v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.11924v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Characterizing interactions between brain areas is a fundamental goal of systems neuroscience. While such analyses are possible when areas are recorded simultaneously, it is rare to observe all combinations of areas of interest within a single animal or recording session. How can we leverage multi-animal datasets to better understand multi-area interactions? Building on recent progress in large-scale, multi-animal models, we introduce NeuroPaint, a masked autoencoding approach for inferring the dynamics of unrecorded brain areas. By training across animals with overlapping subsets of recorded areas, NeuroPaint learns to reconstruct activity in missing areas based on shared structure across individuals. We train and evaluate our approach on synthetic data and two multi-animal, multi-area Neuropixels datasets. Our results demonstrate that models trained across animals with partial observations can successfully in-paint the dynamics of unrecorded areas, enabling multi-area analyses that transcend the limitations of any single experiment.",

      "title": "A reference brain for the clonal raider ant",
      "content": "Ants exhibit remarkable collective and social behaviors, such as alloparental care, chemical communication, homing, and cooperative group hygiene. The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors. Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of regular workers and slightly larger intercaste workers. All workers reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring. This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors. Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain for the species. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, despite homogeneity in genotype, age, and external morphology, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure. This work provides a powerful resource for the emerging clonal raider ant neuroscience community and reveals novel features of the species' neurobiology that may influence social behaviors and colony function.",
