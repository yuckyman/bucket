      "title": "A Birdcage Volume Transmit Coil and 8 Channel Receive Array for Marmoset Brain Imaging at 7T",
      "content": "Objective: To design and fabricate a band-pass birdcage volume resonator and eight channel, conformal receive array coil for MRI of both awake and anesthetized marmoset brain at 7T. The coil is compatible with a whole body 7T clinical MRI scanner running in single channel transmit (sTx) mode. Methods: The marmoset head coil included a shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil with 24 legs, as well as 8 overlapped receive elements. Electromagnetic (EM) field simulation was performed for the 24 leg band pass birdcage Tx coil to calculate the B1+ efficiency. The efficacy of both transmit and receive coil designs were evaluated by measuring standard coil performance metrics. This was done while imaging a marmoset head phantom, as well as by acquiring in vivo, anesthetized and awake marmoset images. Results: The transmit coil along with the optimized receive array produced high resolution (0.8 mm isotropic for EPI images; 0.36 mm isotropic for structural images) and high SNR (between 50 and 80) images of the marmoset brain. The simulated B1+ efficiency of the birdcage at the center of the phantom was 2.6 \u00b5T/sqrt (W). Conclusion and significance: A shielded, band-pass birdcage transmit coil was designed and fabricated for marmoset brain imaging at 7T. An 8-channel receive array consisting of eight overlapped loops, covering the whole brain of the marmoset, was also constructed and applied for signal reception. The system successfully allowed scanning of both young and older marmosets. It is well-suited for longitudinal studies of marmoset brain structure. The coil advantageously allows the study of neurodevelopment and primate brain function.",

      "title": "A Hybrid Distributed Capacitance Birdcage Coil for Small-Animal MR Imaging at 14.1 T",
      "content": "Objective: To develop a transceiver radio frequency (RF) coil optimized for high resolution small-animal imaging at 14.1 T, aimed at enhancing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. Methods: A hybrid distributed capacitance (HDC) birdcage coil was designed, combining conventional endring lumped capacitors with distributed capacitance along the legs, implemented using double-layer copper-clad substrates. Electromagnetic (EM) simulations were employed to optimize the coil's structural parameters and capacitance values for maximum RF performance. The HDC birdcage coil's performance was evaluated against a conventional bandpass (BP) design through electromagnetic simulations, bench tests, and phantom imaging. In vivo validation was performed using mouse imaging. Results: EM simulations demonstrated that the HDC design enhances mean $\\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ and $\\text{B}_{1}^{-}$ field strengths by 11.8% and 11.7%, respectively, relative to the conventional BP design. The HDC design also showed reduced electric field (E-field) value in phantom, with 4.2% lower mean and 11.4% lower maximum E-field value. Bench measurements revealed a superior quality factor (Q factor) for the HDC coil, with a 34.2% higher unloaded Q value compared to the conventional design. Phantom imaging confirmed a 41% SNR improvement with the HDC design. The optimized HDC coil enabled mouse brain imaging at 50 $ \\!\\!\\mu \\!\\!\\text{ m}$ resolution.Conclusion: The proposed HDC birdcage coil demonstrated superior receiver sensitivity and Q factor compared to conventional designs, yielding significant SNR improvements in 14.1 T imaging. Significance: The results demonstrated the feasibility of achieving enhanced coil performance through HDC design at ultra-high field strength, providing a promising approach for improving image quality in small-animal MRI applications.",

      "title": "Show HN: Lume 0.2 \u2013 Build and Run macOS VMs with unattended setup",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN, Lume is an open-source CLI for running macOS and Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Since launch (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42908061</a>), we've been using it to run AI agents in isolated macOS environments. We needed VMs that could set themselves up, so we built that.<p>Here's what's new in 0.2:<p>*Unattended Setup* \u2013 Go from IPSW to a fully configured VM without touching the keyboard. We built a VNC + OCR system that clicks through macOS Setup Assistant automatically. No more manual setup before pushing to a registry:<p><pre><code>  lume create my-vm --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n</code></pre>\nYou can write custom YAML configs to set up any macOS version your way.<p>*HTTP API + Daemon* \u2013 A REST API on port 7777 that runs as a background service. Your scripts and CI pipelines can manage VMs that persist even if your terminal closes:<p><pre><code>  curl -X POST localhost:7777/lume/vms/my-vm/run -d '{\"noDisplay\": true}'\n</code></pre>\n*MCP Server* \u2013 Native integration with Claude Desktop and AI coding agents. Claude can create, run, and execute commands in VMs directly:<p><pre><code>  # Add to Claude Desktop config\n  \"lume\": { \"command\": \"lume\", \"args\": [\"serve\", \"--mcp\"] }\n    \n  # Then just ask: \"Create a sandbox VM and run my tests\"\n</code></pre>\n*Multi-location Storage* \u2013 macOS disk space is always tight, so from user feedback we added support for external drives. Add an SSD, move VMs between locations:<p><pre><code>  lume config storage add external-ssd /Volumes/ExternalSSD/lume\n  lume clone my-vm backup --source-storage default --dest-storage external-ssd\n</code></pre>\n*Registry Support* \u2013 Pull and push VM images from GHCR or GCS. Create a golden image once, share it across your team.<p>We're seeing people use Lume for:\n- Running Claude Code in an isolated VM (your host stays clean, reset mistakes by cloning)\n- CI/CD pipelines for Apple platform apps\n- Automated UI testing across macOS versions\n- Disposable sandboxes for security research<p>To get started:<p><pre><code>  /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trycua/cua/main/libs/lume/scripts/install.sh)\"\n\n  lume create sandbox --os macos --ipsw latest --unattended tahoe\n  lume run sandbox --shared-dir ~/my-project\n</code></pre>\nLume is MIT licensed and Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4) since it uses Apple's native Virtualization Framework directly\u2014no emulation.<p>Lume runs on EC2 Mac instances and Scaleway if you need cloud infrastructure. We're also working on a managed cloud offering for teams that need macOS compute on demand\u2014if you're interested, reach out.<p>We're actively developing this as part of Cua (<a href=\"https://github.com/trycua/cua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trycua/cua</a>), our Computer Use Agent SDK. We'd love your feedback, bug reports, or feature ideas.<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/trycua/cua\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/trycua/cua</a>\nDocs: <a href=\"https://cua.ai/docs/lume\">https://cua.ai/docs/lume</a><p>We'll be here to answer questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670181\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46670181</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
