      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "title": "Exercise, circadian rhythms, and muscle regeneration: a path to healthy aging",
      "content": "The circadian system regulates core physiological processes, including muscle regeneration, protein synthesis, and cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in circadian rhythms contribute to impaired muscle function in older adults, with age-related declines in muscle mass and regenerative capacity serving as major contributors to sarcopenia. Emerging evidence indicates that exercise\u2014a powerful modulator of muscle adaptation\u2014can also influence circadian regulation, offering a potential avenue to enhance muscle repair in aging populations. This review examines how physical activity interacts with circadian mechanisms in aged skeletal muscle, emphasizing key molecular and cellular pathways involved in muscle regeneration. Central circadian regulators such as Clock, BMAL1, and PER1 are discussed in the context of muscle protein turnover, satellite cell activity, and mitochondrial function. Aligning exercise timing with circadian rhythms is proposed as a promising strategy to enhance muscle recovery and functional capacity in older individuals. Furthermore, the review highlights the therapeutic potential of chrono-exercise to delay the onset of sarcopenia and promote healthy aging. By integrating insights from chronobiology, geroscience, and exercise physiology, this analysis underscores the importance of chrono-exercise in supporting muscle health during aging.",

      "title": "Inflammation-related biomarkers and berberine therapy in post-stroke depression: evidence from bioinformatics, machine learning, and experimental validation",
      "content": "ObjectivePost-stroke depression (PSD), a common neuropsychiatric complication, significantly hinders stroke recovery and quality of life. Given the established role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PSD, this study aimed to identify key inflammation-related genes and pathways using bioinformatics and machine learning and further evaluate the protective effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) monomer compounds.MethodsPSD-related datasets (GSE16561, GSE98793) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package, followed by functional enrichment analysis with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Three machine learning algorithms\u2014random forest, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)\u2014were applied to screen inflammation-related hub genes. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Candidate TCM compounds were explored via the Coremine Medical database. A PSD rat model was established to validate hub gene expression and to assess the efficacy of berberine (BBR).ResultsAnalysis identified 35 inflammation-related DEGs (IDEGs) significantly enriched in immunological processes, including malaria pathogenesis, NETosis, innate immune deficiencies, Rap1 signaling, and IL-17 cascades. The integration of machine learning pinpointed TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core hub genes, demonstrating robust diagnostic performance in external validation. Molecular docking suggested a strong binding affinity between the TCM compound BBR and TLR2/CYP1B1 proteins. PSD rats exhibited prolonged immobility in forced swim/tail suspension tests and decreased sucrose preference versus controls, alongside neuronal damage, edema, and inflammatory infiltration (HE staining). BBR treatment reversed these behavioral deficits and pathological changes. Western blot analysis confirmed elevated TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression in PSD rats, significantly downregulated by BBR. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed increased serum IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 levels in PSD, which BBR effectively reduced.ConclusionThis study identifies TLR2 and CYP1B1 as core inflammation-related genes in PSD. BBR demonstrates therapeutic efficacy as an active monomer compound against PSD, likely mediated through downregulating TLR2 and CYP1B1 expression, consequently diminishing the concentrations of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) that mediate cerebroprotective actions.",

      "title": "Prognostic value of quantitative and visual electroencephalography in disorders of consciousness: a retrospective study",
      "content": "BackgroundElectroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to assess prognosis in patients with disorders of consciousness (DoC). Visual assessments by physicians and quantitative EEG (qEEG) are commonly used; however, only a few studies have directly compared their predictive accuracy. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the prognostic value of visual EEG classification versus that of qEEG-based spectral analysis for survival and neurological outcomes in patients with impaired consciousness.MethodsIn this retrospective study, we examined 97 patients with impaired consciousness admitted to the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Fukushima Medical University Hospital between April 2018 and December 2023. Visual EEG grading was performed using a conventional grading system based on established criteria. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare predictive performance. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed incorporating qEEG and clinical prognostic factors (Scarpino score, rehabilitation status, and age). The incremental predictive value of clinical variables was assessed using DeLong\u2019s test.ResultsVisual EEG assessment showed moderate predictive accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77 for survival; 0.677\u20130.725 for neurological outcomes]. qEEG-based models showed comparable performance to visual EEG classification, with slightly higher AUC values that were not statistically significant. The addition of clinical factors significantly improved predictive accuracy, particularly for neurological recovery (AUC improved from 0.729 to 0.936; P < 0.001).ConclusionCombining qEEG features and clinical prognostic factors provided a comprehensive approach for outcome prediction in patients with DoC. These findings support the potential of a multimodal prognostic framework integrating objective EEG metrics and physician-derived evaluations, although further prospective validation is required.",

      "content": "ObjectivesMutations in KIDINS220 are known to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) and SINO syndrome. However, the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of KIDINS220-related disorders remains incompletely understood. Herein, we describe the clinical, electrophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features of a novel KIDINS220 sterile alpha motif (SAM) -like domain mutation identified in a Chinese family with HSP accompanied by severe peripheral neuropathy (PN).MethodsClinical data, electrophysiological characteristics, and sural nerve histopathology were analyzed in a 19-year-old Chinese male. Genetic testing was performed in his family by using whole-exome sequencing, mitochondrial genome testing, and Sanger validation. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to analyze the phenotypic and genetic data of previously reported cases with KIDINS220 variants up to July 2025.ResultsThe proband exhibited classical signs of autosomal dominant HSP accompanied by severe multifocal sensory-motor PN. The spinal cord MRI showed mild spinal cord thinning, while the brain MRI and nerve ultrasound examinations were normal. Electrophysiological study revealed absent sensory nerve responses and globally reduced motor conduction velocities. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed significantly reduced nerve fiber density, myelin defects, axonal degeneration, and mitochondrial abnormalities. A heterozygous KIDINS220 c.3668A > G (p. Glu1223Gly) mutation, located within the SAM domain, was identified in both the proband and his mother. A total of 42 cases from 11 cohorts were reviewed.ConclusionWe suggest that patients with KIDINS220 SAM domain mutation may present with HSP accompanied by severe, mixed axonal and demyelinating PN, expanding the existing spectrum of the clinical phenotypes and pathogenic variants of KIDINS220.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12146v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The paper presents a comparative user study between an Augmented Reality-based Computer-Aided Design (AR-CAD) system and a traditional computer-based CAD modeling software, SolidWorks. Twenty participants of varying skill levels performed 3D modeling tasks using both systems. The results showed that while the average task completion time is comparable for both groups, novice designers had a higher completion rate in AR-CAD than in the traditional CAD interface, and experienced designers had a similar completion rate in both systems. A statistical comparison of task completion rate, time, and NASA Task Load Index (TLX) showed that AR-CAD slightly reduced cognitive load while favoring a high task completion rate. Higher scores on the System Usability Scale (SUS) by novices indicated that AR-CAD was superior and worthwhile for reducing barriers to entering CAD. In contrast, the Traditional CAD interface was favored by experienced users for its advanced capabilities, while many viewed AR-CAD as a valid means for rapid concept development, education, and an initial critique of designs. This opens up the need for future research on the needed refinement of AR-CAD with a focus on high-precision input tools and its evaluation of complex design processes. This research highlights the potential for immersive interfaces to enhance design practice, bridging the gap between novice and experienced CAD users.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.12113v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The landscape of interactive systems is shifting toward dynamic, generative experiences that empower users to explore and construct knowledge in real time. Yet, timelines -- a fundamental tool for representing historical and conceptual development -- remain largely static, limiting user agency and curiosity. We introduce the concept of a generative timeline: an AI-powered timeline that adapts to users' evolving questions by expanding or contracting in response to input. We instantiate this concept through KnowledgeTrail, a system that enables users to co-construct timelines of historical events and knowledge formation processes. Two user studies showed that KnowledgeTrail fosters curiosity-driven exploration, serendipitous discovery, and the ability to trace complex relationships between ideas and events, while citation features supported verification yet revealed fragile trust shaped by perceptions of source credibility. We contribute a vision for generative timelines as a new class of exploratory interface, along with design insights for balancing serendipity and credibility.",

      "title": "Social Simulation for Integrating Self-Care: Measuring the Effects of Contextual Environments in Augmented Reality for Mental Health Practice",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.12081v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite growing interest in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) for mental well-being, prior work using immersive interventions to teach mental health skills has largely focused on calming or abstract settings. As a result, little is known about how realistic social simulation may better support the transfer and application of skills to in-person environments. In this work, we present a 14-day user study with 43-participants comparing an augmented reality intervention simulating a realistic contextual environment against a matched non-contextual control, applied to the public speaking context. We found that participants who practice mental health skills in the contextual environment showed significantly greater likelihood to apply self-care techniques and greater physiological stress reduction when using skills in mock in-person tasks. Overall, our work provides empirical evidence for the effects of realistic stressor simulation, and offers design implications for mental health technology that supports effective transfer of skills to the real-world.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.11999v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper extends the functionality of block ordering problems (such as Parsons problems and Proof Blocks) to include optional blocks. We detail the algorithms used to implement the optional block feature and present usage experiences from instructors who have integrated it into their curriculum. The optional blocks feature enables instructors to create more complex Parsons problems with multiple correct solutions utilizing omitted or optional blocks. This affords students a method to engage with questions that have several valid solutions composed of different answer components. Instructors can specify blocks with multiple mutually exclusive dependencies, which we represent using a multigraph structure. This multigraph is then collapsed into multiple directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), allowing us to reuse existing algorithms for grading block ordering problems represented as a DAG. We present potential use cases for this feature across various domains, including helping students learn Git workflows, shell command sequences, mathematical proofs, and Python programming concepts.",

      "title": "VizCopilot: Fostering Appropriate Reliance on Enterprise Chatbots with Context Visualization",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.11954v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Enterprise chatbots show promise in supporting knowledge workers in information synthesis tasks by retrieving context from large, heterogeneous databases before generating answers. However, when the retrieved context misaligns with user intentions, the chatbot often produces \"irrelevantly right\" responses that provide little value. In this work, we introduce VizCopilot, a prototype that incorporates visualization techniques to actively involve end-users in context alignment. By combining topic modeling with document visualization, VizCopilot enables human oversight and modification of retrieved context while keeping cognitive overhead manageable. We used VizCopilot as a design probe in a Research-through-Design study to evaluate the role of visualization in context alignment and to surface future design opportunities. Our findings show that visualization not only helps users detect and correct misaligned context but also encourages them to adapt their prompting strategies, enabling the system to retrieve more relevant context from the outset. At the same time, the study reveals limitations in verification support regarding close-reading and trust in AI summaries. We outline future directions for visualization-enhanced chatbots, focusing on personalization, proactivity, and sustainable human-AI collaboration.",
