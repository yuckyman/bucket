      "title": "UHGAN: a dual-phase GAN with Hough-transform constraints for accurate farmland road extraction",
      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

We\u2019re Ethan and Danny, the authors of Tangent (<a href=\"https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent</a>), a Rust-based log pipeline where all normalization, enrichment, and detection logic runs as WASM plugins.<p>We kept seeing the same problems in the OCSF (<a href=\"https://ocsf.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ocsf.io</a>) community:\n1) Schemas change constantly. Large companies have whole teams dedicated to keeping vendor\u2192OCSF mappings up to date.\n2) There\u2019s no shared library of mappings, so everyone recreates the same work.\n3) Writing mappers is tedious, repetitive work.\n4) Most pipelines use proprietary DSLs that are hard to share and hard for tools/LLMs to generate.<p>Tangent takes a different approach: no DSLs \u2013 mappings and enrichments are just normal code compiled to WASM, shareable plugins \u2013 we maintain a community library (<a href=\"https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins</a>), interoperability \u2013 we can run other engines\u2019 DSLs (e.g., Bloblang) inside WASM for easy migration, full flexibility \u2013 plugins can validate schemas, call external APIs (<a href=\"https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent/blob/main/examples/enrichment/main.go#L58\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent/blob/main/examples/en...</a>), or perform complex transforms (<a href=\"https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins/blob/main/zeek-ocsf/conn/main.go#L312\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/telophasehq/tangent-plugins/blob/main/zee...</a>).<p>Here's an example Python transformation plugin to drop all fields from a log except `message`:<p><pre><code>  import json\n  \n  from typing import List\n  \n  from wit_world.imports import log\n  \n  # `log.Logview` is Tangent's zero-copy JSON accessor type.\n  \n  def process_logs(self, logs: List[log.Logview]) -> bytes:\n  \n      out = bytearray()\n  \n      for lv in logs:\n  \n          msg = lv.get(\"msg\")\n  \n          value = msg.value if msg is not None else \"\"\n  \n          out.extend(json.dumps({\"message\": value}).encode() + b\"\\n\")\n  \n      return bytes(out)\n</code></pre>\nWe have plenty more examples in the repo.<p>Because plugins are just Go/Python/Rust, LLMs can create new mappers with ease. For example, I asked:<p><pre><code>  Generate a mapper from AWS Security Hub Finding to OCSF\n</code></pre>\nand only had to make a few minor tweaks.

The CLI includes tooling to scaffold, test, and benchmark plugins locally.<p>We\u2019d love to get your feedback!

      "title": "COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ACTING TOGETHER: A NON-HUMAN PRIMATE MODEL OF COOPERATIVE DECISION-MAKING",
      "content": "Cooperation is a crucial aspect of social behavior, allowing individuals to achieve goals unattainable alone. However, collective actions require costly inter-individual coordination, making continuous cost-benefit evaluation essential before engaging in cooperation. Non-human primate models can help uncover the evolutionary foundations of human cooperation and its underlying neural mechanisms. To this aim, we developed a novel paradigm to analyze the dyadic behavior of two macaques, who took turns in choosing between individual and cooperative actions to obtain variable rewards. Each monkey used a joystick to guide a cursor toward one of two targets, each indicating both the reward magnitude and the action type (i.e. 'solo action' or 'joint action') required to obtain their payoff. We first observed a linear improvement in dyadic performance with the expected reward magnitude. Although macaques tended to prefer individual actions, they selected to act jointly under favorable payoff conditions, indicating that voluntary cooperation in macaques can emerge as a reward-driven process. Logistic models of their choices revealed the subjective cost monkeys assigned to cooperation, which was consistent across subjects. Nonetheless, the gain rate across different sessions increased over time, suggesting that macaques possess the cognitive ability to optimize their dyadic strategies, by estimating not only the coordination costs but also the benefits of cooperation. We observed a progressive reduction in the subjective cost assigned to joint action, which was not directly dependent on performance improvements. Our findings suggest that non-human primates can weigh the costs and benefits of cooperation, highlighting their ability to dynamically adjust social strategies based on reward contingencies.",

      "title": "Adult Drosophila aversion to caffeine requires a unique TrpA1 isoform and the PLC signaling cascade",
      "content": "Taste in Drosophila melanogaster is crucial to survival, influencing feeding, mating, and egg laying behaviors. Taste organs are located on various parts of the body, including the legs, proboscis, wings, and ovipositor. Taste neurons detect chemicals via receptors like GRs, IRs, and TRPs, with bitter and sweet tastes linked to specific neurons (Gr66a+ and Gr5a+). Bitter substances such as caffeine activate neurons, resulting in rejection behavior. TrpA1 channels, associated with aversive responses, are involved in complex behaviors and could interact with taste receptors. Our results show that caffeine mixed with sucrose reduces proboscis extension in flies compared to sucrose alone, a response that requires only the TrpA1-E isoform out of the five possible ones. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that this avoidance requires TrpA1 and signaling via PLC and IP3-receptors in adult Gr66a+ neurons.",

      "title": "Neurometabolic signatures of gastrointestinal symptoms in the insula of Crohn\u2019s disease patients: explorative findings from a 7T MRS study",
      "content": "BackgroundThe bidirectional communication between the brain and gut in Crohn\u2019s disease is increasingly acknowledged, highlighting how gut inflammation can influence brain function and psychological health, and vice versa, through the gut-brain axis. The insula is critical for processing pain, its emotional evaluation, and for regulating neurometabolites involved in these processes. The role of insular neurometabolites in gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly pain, in Crohn\u2019s disease patients, however, is not well-understood, highlighting the need for further investigation. Therefore, this study aims to enhance our understanding of the connection between Crohn\u2019s disease and brain function by investigating neurometabolic profiles in the insula of patients with Crohn\u2019s disease.MethodsIn this study, 7 Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) was utilized to examine the left insular cortex in 14 individuals with Crohn\u2019s disease and 14 age- and gender-matched healthy controls during resting state. Participants also completed neuropsychological evaluations, including the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS).ResultsNo significant differences were found in the absolute concentrations of insular neurometabolites between Crohn\u2019s disease patients and healthy controls. However, in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease, GSRS scores were negatively correlated with the neurometabolites aspartate (Asp) and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) in the insula. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between scores on the PCS magnification subscale and concentrations of neurometabolites\u2014namely glutamine (Gln) and the combined glutamate and glutamine signal (Glx) \u2014as measured by (1H-MRS).ConclusionThe neurometabolic alterations observed in the insular cortex of Crohn\u2019s disease patients suggest increased insular activity, which may enhance interoceptive awareness and pain sensitivity, potentially contributing to heightened pain catastrophizing.",

      "title": "A validated panel of commercial antibodies for reliable detection of FET proteins.",
      "content": "The FET protein family comprises the highly conserved RNA-binding proteins FUS, EWS and TAF15 which are implicated in RNA metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTLD. Despite their structural similarity, reliable detection of individual FET proteins remains challenging due to antibody cross-reactivity and inconsistent localisation patterns reported in the literature. To address this, we systematically evaluated 23 commercially available antibodies for specificity and performance across western blotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Using single and double shRNA knockdowns in HeLa cells, we confirmed target engagement and identified antibodies which were specific as well as those with significant cross-reactivity. Immunofluorescence in rat primary neurons and HeLa cells showed antibody and cell type dependent variations in nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation; from these, we identified a subset that demonstrated high-quality, region-specific staining in postmortem human brain tissue. Our findings highlight substantial variability in antibody performance and underscore the need for rigorous validation to ensure reproducibility in FET protein research. We present a validated panel of antibodies suitable for diverse applications, providing a critical resource for studies of FET protein biology and pathology.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Exploration of Auditory Sensory-Perceptual Processing in CLN3 Disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)): A High-Density Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) Study.",
      "content": "Background: There is currently limited information about sensory and perceptual abilities across the progression of CLN3 disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis; Batten disease), a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disorder and a leading cause of childhood neurodegeneration. Clinical symptoms include vision loss, motor impairments, and cognitive challenges, making it difficult to accurately assess neurocognitive and perceptual abilities. Thus, there is a critical need to identify objective biomarkers that can be used to inform disease progression and track treatment response in this population. Methods: This exploratory study investigates longitudinal changes in auditory sensory perceptual processing in a small sample of individuals with genetically confirmed CLN3 disease (N=4; 3 male) compared to a cross-sectional sample of 60 neurotypical (NT) controls using high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We utilized a duration mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm, identical to what has been used in our previous cross-sectional study. We examined the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) of the standard tones across three different stimulus onset asynchrony conditions and examined the N1 and P2 components of the AEP. Results: We found age related differences in the amplitudes of the N1 and P2 components in individuals with CLN3 disease relative to NT controls. These amplitude differences were most notable in CLN3 disease when participants were presented with standard tones that had the slowest presentation rate. Specifically, N1 and P2 amplitudes were more negative than NT controls in childhood and adolescence and as CLN3 disease participants aged, the amplitude of the AEPs was greater than controls. Further, a more positive N1 amplitude during the longest stimulus presentation condition was associated with both reduced verbal intelligence and working memory abilities in CLN3 disease participants. Conclusions: Our preliminary findings parallel recently published work in a mouse model of CLN3 disease that showed both sex- and age-dependent disruptions in central auditory processing. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of auditory EEG measures as a sensitive, objective and translational measure in CLN3 disease that may serve as a potential outcome measure useful in tracking disease progression. Continued work is needed in humans focused on sex-based differences and longitudinal changes of auditory processing in CLN3 disease.",

      "title": "A New Method for Optimal Placement of Tumor Treating Fields Electrodes",
      "content": "Overview: Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) provide a non-invasive treatment option for newly diagnosed glioblastoma. While optimization of electrode placement is important to increase treatment efficacy, clinical therapy planning is done using an undisclosed and proprietary software (NovoTAL), which is clinically unvalidated. This study investigates a new computational approach for optimizing TTFields electrode placement and is compared to the current clinical standard. Methods: We developed a new computational pipeline integrating patient-specific anatomical data to optimize electrode configurations in five representative glioblastoma cases with diverse tumor locations and sizes. Two optimization strategies were employed: one maximizing electric field intensity at the tumor, and another enhancing coverage of the adjacent brain while maintaining sufficient tumor intensity. Results were compared to electrode placements generated by NovoTAL. Additional simulations with artificial tumors assessed the effects of tumor size and location. Results: Optimized electrode placements improved electric field intensity in tumors by 18%-34% compared to the clinical standard. Coverage-weighted optimizations provided broader field coverage without significantly compromising tumor intensity. Smaller or surface-adjacent tumors benefited most from optimization, achieving precise targeting and enhanced coverage. Extensive randomized placement analyses highlighted the superior performance of the optimized configurations. Analysis of artificial models showed consistent improvements across varying tumor locations and sizes. Conclusion: Personalized optimization of TTFields electrode placement significantly improves electric field targeting of tumors and adjacent brain regions. This approach outperforms standardized planning software and clinical practices and supports future development of adaptive, automated strategies for individualized TTFields therapy in glioblastoma.",

      "title": "A 4-pole Theory-Based Compensation Method using Multiple Loads for Impedance Spectroscopy of Porcine Brain Tissue",
      "content": "Accurate determination of the electrical properties of brain tissue -conductivity and relative permittivity - is essential for modeling and optimizing neurostimulation and neuroimaging and modulation techniques such as EEG, MEG, TMS, and TES. However, large discrepancies in reported conductivity values highlight the methodological challenges associated with impedance measurements. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of compensation methods in impedance spectroscopy to improve measurement accuracy using a self-developed four-point platinum electrode designed for biological tissue applications. Three compensation algorithms - open-short, open-short-load, and multiple-load - were implemented and compared using an RC parallel test circuit that emulated typical measurement conditions, with load resistances ranging from 250 Ohm to 5000 Ohm. Quantitative error analysis demonstrated that the multiple-load method achieved the lowest normalized root mean square error (3.4%) and superior stability across frequencies from 100 Hz to 1 MHz. The calibrated probe was subsequently applied to post mortem porcine brain tissue, yielding conductivity values of grey matter of 0.109 S/m and white matter of 0.074 S/m. These results are significantly lower than standard simulation parameters of 0.275 S/m, and 0.126 S/m for grey and white matter, respectively. Finite-element simulations revealed that using the measured conductivities increased electric field predictions by 2.1% for TMS and 46% for TES in the maximum electric field magnitude, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that accurate impedance compensation is critical for reliable characterization of brain tissue and for enhancing the precision of neurostimulation modeling in the future.",

      "title": "Silmitasertib, an FDA-designated orphan CK2 Inhibitor, ameliorates neuropathology and motor dysfunction in a Huntington's disease mouse model",
      "content": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease that manifests with progressive motor, cognitive, and psychological impairments. HD is caused by a polyQ (CAG) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to the misfolding and aggregation of mutant HTT protein (mHTT) and the preferential degeneration of the striatum. Previously in our lab, we identified Protein Kinase CK2 as an important kinase involved in the pathophysiology of HD. Specifically, the alpha prime catalytic subunit of CK2 (CK2') is upregulated in HD, and genetic depletion of CK2' in HD mice results in improved motor behavior, decreased mutant Htt aggregation, and improved neuronal function. Silmitasertib (CX-4945) is an FDA designated orphan drug that inhibits CK2. This study aims to investigate whether CX-4945 treatment ameliorates HD pathology. We treated prodromal and late symptomatic HD mice, and used a variety of immunohistochemical, biochemical, physiological and behavioral approaches. We found that CX-4945 presented benefits in the amelioration of HD pathophysiology in both treated groups. Importantly, we found CX-4945 decreased mHtt aggregation, increased DARPP-32 expression and excitatory synapse density, restored homeostatic astrocyte phenotypes and ameliorated neuroinflammation and microgliosis, altogether resulting in improved motor behavior. These results support CX-4945 as a strong candidate for a targeted therapy to treat HD.",

      "title": "Comparing Methods for Mass Univariate Analyses of Human EEG: Empirical Data and Simulations",
      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used method for investigating human brain dynamics. However, EEG analyses are frequently conducted with limited a priori knowledge regarding locations or latencies of meaningful statistical effects. This makes it difficult for researchers to form regions of interest (ROIs), which are then analyzed using traditional statistical models such as analysis of variance. In addition, exploratory studies, or studies interested in determining the exact temporal and spatial extent of a predicted effect may aim to examine many sensor locations and time points, often jointly. To address this, mass univariate analyses have become a valuable complement to ROI-based approaches. These methods attempt to correct for multiple comparisons while mitigating the risk of false positives and false negatives, thus enabling statistical inference in high-dimensional EEG data. Here, we review and evaluate different approaches for delineating spatial and temporal effect boundaries in three different datasets, focusing on within-subjects comparisons. Specifically, we focus on permutation-based approaches and their Bayesian alternatives to address condition differences in i) steady-state evoked responses, ii) event-related potentials, and iii) time-frequency data. Overall, simulation results indicate that cluster-based permutation tests provide a relatively liberal approach to correct for multiple comparisons across domains, with high sensitivity for detecting large effects. In contrast, the permutation-based tmax procedure yields the most conservative method across datasets. Bayesian approaches inherently are continuous in nature and thus strongly depend on the selection of thresholds for when support for a hypothesis is considered meaningful.",
