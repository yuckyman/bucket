      "title": "A pilot study on simultaneous stimulation of the primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area using gait-synchronized rhythmic brain stimulation to improve gait variability in post-stroke hemiparetic patients",
      "content": "IntroductionGait impairment is a common and disabling consequence of stroke. While walking speed is a key indicator of recovery, gait variability is closely associated with fall risk and long-term functional decline. Previous studies have suggested that functional interaction between the supplementary motor area (SMA) and primary motor cortex (M1) plays a key role in post-stroke gait control. Rather than stimulating these regions independently, simultaneous activation of the SMA\u2014critical for rhythm modulation and motor planning\u2014and gait-synchronized stimulation of the M1\u2014essential for motor execution\u2014may offer enhanced benefits for gait stability.ObjectiveTo assess the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of a combined brain stimulation intervention targeting the SMA and M1 on gait variability and balance in individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis.MethodsSixteen individuals with stroke within 180 days after the onset, aged 40\u201390 years, who were able to walk on a treadmill were recruited in this study of multi-center, randomized, controlled pilot trial with a parallel-group design. Participants were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (n = 8) receiving 20 min of simultaneous transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the SMA and gait-synchronized rhythmic stimulation to the M1 during treadmill walking, or to a control group (n = 8) receiving sham stimulation. Both groups underwent 15 sessions of walking practice over 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were feasibility indicators including recruitment, retention, adherence and adverse events and preliminary estimates of effect on gait variability such as coefficient of variation for stride, stance, and swing times on the paretic side. Balance was assessed using the Mini-Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Mini-BESTest).ResultsAll 16 participants completed the intervention without adverse events, indicating high feasibility. The intervention group showed significantly reduced stride time variability on the paretic side and improved Mini-BESTest scores compared to the control group. A significant correlation was observed between reductions in gait variability and improvements in balance.ConclusionsThis pilot trial supports the feasibility and safety of a combined SMA and M1 stimulation approach. Preliminary findings suggest potential benefits in reducing gait variability and improving balance after stroke, warranting further investigation in a definitive trial.",

      "title": "Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) for spastic cerebral palsy",
      "content": "BackgroundGait abnormalities in spastic cerebral palsy (CP) result from four primary neuromuscular impairments: muscle weakness, short muscle-relative-to-skeletal-length, muscle spasticity, and impaired selective motor control. The Clinical Gait Evaluation with Neuromuscular Impairments (Clinical GENI) was developed to help clinicians identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP for use in any clinical setting.AimsThis study evaluated use and validity of the observational-based Clinical GENI to identify gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in children with spastic CP.MethodsPatients with spastic CP seen in 2023 for instrumented gait analysis and physical exam of neuromuscular impairments were evaluated using the Clinical GENI. Validity was assessed by agreement between identification of gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI compared to 3D gait kinematics. Severity of neuromuscular impairments associated with gait abnormalities listed on the Clinical GENI was compared, and severity of neuromuscular impairment was correlated with severity of gait abnormalities.ResultsParticipants included 12 children with spastic CP (4 GMFCS I, 8 GMFCS II; mean age 11.25 years). The most common gait abnormalities were forefoot/flatfoot initial contact (IC) (16/24), flexed-knee IC (19/24), hip-flexion in single limb stance (12/24), and reduced pre-swing ankle plantarflexion (19/24). Strong agreement (83\u2013100%) occurred between gait abnormalities on the Clinical GENI and kinematic values. Severity of neuromuscular impairment was higher (p < 0.05) for those with gait abnormalities vs. without and correlated to severity of gait abnormalities in a majority of comparisons.ConclusionResults support clinical utility and validity of the Clinical GENI for evaluating gait abnormalities and contributing neuromuscular impairments in spastic CP.",

      "content": "Gamma oscillations (30\u2013100\u202fHz), as a rhythmic neuronal activity within the central nervous system, play a pivotal role in the initiation, progression, and therapeutic management of pain. By synthesizing relevant experimental and clinical evidence, this review examines pain-induced alterations in gamma oscillations across cortical regions and surveys recent gamma oscillation-based therapeutic interventions for pain management. Gamma oscillations in key cortical areas\u2014including the somatosensory cortices, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula\u2014are significantly modulated by pain. Therapeutic approaches encompass pharmacological agents (e.g., morphine, ketamine) and non-pharmacological modalities (e.g., electroacupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). Emerging therapies such as virtual reality and music-based analgesia offer novel mechanistic insights. However, current research faces limitations, including prevalent insufficient sample sizes. Future research should leverage AI to conduct real-world studies, establish electroencephalogram databases, and investigate the role of gamma oscillations in disease pathology. This will advance precision pain management and optimize therapeutic outcomes for patients.",

      "title": "The role of suprasegmental cues in perception of sentences with linguistic ambiguity under informational masking",
      "content": "IntroductionReal-life communication contains rich and informative suprasegmental cues, such as variations in intensity, duration, and fundamental frequency. Although suprasegmental information is an essential component of spoken communication, we know little about its role in speech perception in the presence of background masker. Building on literature showing that suprasegmental cues facilitate the processing of spoken sentences with linguistic ambiguity, we addressed two questions in the present study. First, does the facilitative effect of suprasegmental cues on speech recognition interact with the amount of informational masking in speech maskers? Second, how do listeners use suprasegmental and lexico-semantic cues when listening to linguistically ambiguous sentences masked by competing speech maskers?MethodsWe collected both offline performance data (recognition accuracy) and online processing effort data (pupil dilation) from 37 young adults with age-typical hearing. The speech material consisted of 15 sets of temporarily ambiguous early closure sentences, each with two suprasegmental conditions (facilitative vs. neutral) and two lexico-semantic conditions (transitive vs. intransitive subordinate verb). These sentences were embedded in original and time-reversed two-talker speech maskers differing in the amount of informational masking.ResultsRecognition accuracy was higher with facilitative suprasegmental cues, particularly in maskers with less informational masking, as well as with facilitative lexico-semantic cues. Listeners expended greater processing effort throughout the sentence when suprasegmental cues were neutral, especially under more adverse conditions (i.e., stronger informational masking or greater linguistic ambiguity).DiscussionThis study makes multiple contributions to the literature. First, the recognition accuracy data showed that informational masking and linguistic ambiguity interact with suprasegmental effects: these adverse conditions reduce the benefit of facilitative suprasegmental cues for speech recognition. Second, under stronger informational masking and greater linguistic ambiguity, the absence of facilitative suprasegmental cues increased effort during online speech processing. Third, we found that facilitative suprasegmental cues improved immediate recall of segmental information (i.e., words) in speech perception in speech maskers. Finally, our accuracy and effort data demonstrate the importance of using both offline and online measures of speech processing, as each reveals different aspects of the dynamic process of speech perception under adverse conditions.",

      "content": "The chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication (dup15q) is defined as the presence of three or more copies of 15q11.2-q13.1. The features of the chromosome 15q11-q13 duplication syndrome include developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, facial anomalies, autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and behavioral problems. To date, more than 120 cases of 15q11-q13 duplication have been reported, but studies on clinical information about prenatal diagnosis of 15q11-q13 duplication and attitudes toward fetuses with 15q11-q13 duplication are extremely limited. Herein, we first report a retrospective Chinese cohort with prenatal diagnosis of 15q11-q13 duplication involving ten phenotypically normal pregnant women. In this Chinese cohort, most of fetuses (90%) with 15q11-q13 duplications did not have ultrasound abnormalities. Although the penetrance of 15q11-q13 duplication appeared to be incomplete, 60% of families opted to terminate the pregnancy due to concerns about potential risks. Not all 15q11-q13 duplications were attributed to the parental inheritance, 15q11-q13 duplications could also be caused by parental genomic structure variation. We hope that this study provides new and useful insights into the prenatal diagnosis of 15q11-q13 duplication, thereby informing genetic counseling and decision-making regarding pregnancy outcomes.",

The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
