      "title": "Imaging progenitor cell differentiation during central nervous system remyelination using an MRI gene reporter",
      "content": "Demyelination, the loss of the myelin sheath from around otherwise intact axons, occurs in several diseases, most notably multiple sclerosis (MS). Demyelinated axons that are not remyelinated are vulnerable to irreversible degeneration and therefore therapies that enhance remyelination have been sought. However, there remains a paucity of suitable outcome measures to assess their efficacy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging modality that is used both preclinically and clinically for the assessment of anatomy and tissue function. Here we describe an MRI technique for following the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into oligodendrocytes during the spontaneous regenerative process of remyelination in vivo. OPCs were transduced in situ with a lentiviral vector expressing an organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp1a1) under the control of the differentiation-specific Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) promoter. Oatp1a1 mediates cell uptake of a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent (Primovist), allowing detection of the cells in T1-weighted MR images. Uptake of the contrast agent is restricted to MBP-expressing cells, which is most highly expressed during myelin sheath formation, thereby allowing progenitor-mediated, and potentially oligodendrocyte-mediated, remyelination to be monitored non-invasively in vivo using MRI. These findings provide the foundation for the development of direct methods for assessing the efficacy of pro-remyelination therapies.",

      "title": "Linking brain structure to stress reactivity: Cingulate surface area predicts acute cortisol responses",
      "content": "Background: Altered stress responses are closely linked to mental disorders, but the role of brain structure in acute cortisol responses to psychosocial stress remains underexplored, particularly in healthy individuals. Previous studies, with predominantly small samples, primarily focused on selected limbic regions and functional measures. Thus, this study investigates associations between brain structure and cortisol responses to psychosocial stress, exploring if hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity can be predicted from brain morphology. Methods: Our study included 291 subjects (157 females, 18-62 years) and consisted of two parts. First, a confirmatory analysis examined associations between specific cortical surface area, thickness, and subcortical volume with stress-induced cortisol increases using Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (PALM). Second, we conducted an exploratory whole-brain vertex-wise analysis, followed by out-of-sample prediction of cortisol increases from structural measures. Results: We found consistent negative associations between cingulate cortex (CC) sub-structures and acute cortisol increases. In PALM- and whole-brain analysis, a smaller surface area of the left rostral and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (cACC), posterior cingulate cortex, and right cACC were associated with higher cortisol stress responses, particularly in males. The left cACC surface area emerged as the most promising predictor in machine learning analyses. Additionally, other fronto-limbic structures were also associated with or predictive of acute cortisol reactivity. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that cortical and subcortical structural measures, particularly smaller surface areas of the CC, predict acute hormonal stress responses. Notably, the left cACC emerged as the most consistent predictor, underlining its potential as a biomarker for stress-related diseases.",

      "title": "Atypical low-frequency and high-frequency neural entrainment to rhythmic audiovisual speech in adults with dyslexia",
      "content": "Developmental dyslexia has been linked to atypical neural processing of the temporal dynamics of speech, but there has been disagreement concerning whether faster or slower dynamics are impaired. According to the Temporal Sampling (TS) theory, dyslexia arises from impaired entrainment of low-frequency neural oscillations - particularly in the delta (1-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands - to the rhythmic modulations of speech. This hypothesis was tested for adults with and without dyslexia using electroencephalography (EEG) during a rhythmic audiovisual speech paradigm, previously delivered to children. Participants viewed a \"talking head\" repeating the syllable \"ba\" at a 2-Hz rate. Measures were neural phase entrainment and band power in the delta, theta, beta (15-25 Hz), and low gamma (25-40 Hz) bands, and broadband event-related potentials (ERPs), focusing on the N1 and P2 components. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and phase-phase coupling (PPC) were also assessed for delta-theta, delta-beta, theta-beta, delta-gamma, and theta-gamma interactions. Both groups exhibited significant delta- and theta-band phase entrainment; however, the two groups differed significantly in the preferred phase for the theta band. While the control group showed consistent beta- and low gamma-band phase entrainment, this was not observed for the dyslexic group. There was significantly greater delta-band power for the dyslexic group across the whole brain and in the right temporal region. Additionally, the P2 ERP component differed significantly between groups. The data are interpreted with respect to TS theory.",

      "title": "sAPPalpha inhibits neurite outgrowth in primary mouse neurons via GABA B Receptor subunit 1a",
      "content": "Neurite outgrowth is essential for neural circuit formation and is tightly regulated by secreted factors and their receptors. The secreted extracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha) has been shown to modulate neurite outgrowth. Recently, the gamma amino butyric acid receptor type-B subunit 1a (GABABR1a) was identified as an sAPPalpha binding partner that mediates its effects on synaptic transmission. Here, we investigated whether this interaction also regulates neurite outgrowth. In primary hippocampal neurons, the GABABR agonist baclofen reduced axon length; whereas, its antagonist CGP54626 increased axon length in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, GABABR1a knockout increased axon length and abolished the effect of baclofen. Application of sAPPalpha reduced axon length, an effect that required the presence of both GABABR1a and the extension domain of sAPPalpha, which mediates its binding to GABABR1a. Similarly, the APP 17mer peptide, which is sufficient to bind GABABR1a and mimic the effects of sAPP on synaptic transmission, reduced axon outgrowth in wildtype but not in GABABR1a-deficient neurons. Together, these findings indicate that the 1a isoform contributes to GABABR-dependent suppression of neurite outgrowth and mediates the inhibitory effect of sAPPalpha on neurite outgrowth.",

      "title": "Distribution of metabotropic serotonergic receptors in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the auditory midbrain",
      "content": "The neurotransmitter serotonin modulates a variety of behavioral and physiological responses in the brain. Serotonergic neurons from the dorsal raphe nuclei send a dense projection to the auditory system, including the inferior colliculus (IC), the midbrain hub of the central auditory system. In the IC, serotonin alters how neurons respond to complex sounds, and it has been implicated in the generation or perception of tinnitus. However, the distribution of serotonergic receptors and the identity of neurons that express serotonergic receptors in the IC remains unclear. Here, we hypothesized that IC GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons differentially express serotonergic receptors. To test this hypothesis, we performed in situ hybridization in IC brain slices of male and female mice using probes for Vgat (GABAergic neuron marker) and Vglut2 (glutamatergic neuron marker), along with probes for six subtypes of metabotropic serotonergic receptors: 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B (Htr1a and Htr1b, inhibitory, Gi/o G protein receptors), 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C (Htr2a, Htr2b, and Htr2c excitatory, Gq11 G protein receptors) and, 5-HT7 (excitatory, Gs G protein receptors). Our data show that glutamatergic IC neurons primarily express inhibitory serotonergic receptors. In contrast, a larger proportion of GABAergic neurons express excitatory serotonergic receptors. Our data suggest that serotonin exerts an inhibitory net effect on IC neuronal circuits. These findings contribute to our understanding of how serotonin signaling influences auditory processing. The differential expression of serotonergic receptors may help shape the balance of excitation and inhibition in the auditory midbrain, affecting sound processing.",

      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "title": "Risk of postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events in patients with spontaneous intracranial hematoma stratified by type 2 diabetes mellitus",
      "content": "Background and purposeDiabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common concomitant disease of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Postoperative major adverse cerebrovascular events (post-MACEs) may diminish the surgical benefits of patients with ICH. However, evidence regarding the impact of DM on post-MACEs remains limited.MethodsThis was a multicenter cohort study that enrolled ICH patients presenting to eight neurosurgery departments between January 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021. Patients were categorized into DM group and no diabetes mellitus (nDM) group, based on the presence or absence of DM. Intergroup comparisons were performed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann\u2013Whitney U tests for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the impact of DM on post-MACEs and 30-days mortality after adjusting for confounding factors. A stratified analysis was also conducted based on the type of post-MACEs.ResultsA total of 688 ICH patients were included in the study, of whom 576 (83.7%) were classified into the nDM group and 112 (16.3%) into the DM group. Compared with the nDM group, the DM group exhibited significantly higher incidences of overall post-MACEs (28.6%), ischemic post-MACEs (14.3%), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (23.2%), and 30-days mortality (9.8%). After adjusting for potential confounding factors including sex, age, alcohol, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, antiplatelet therapy, and intraventricular hemorrhage, DM remained a significant predictor of overall post-MACEs (OR: 1.790, 95%CI: 1.072\u20132.990, p\u202f=\u202f0.026), ischemic post-MACEs (OR: 2.139, 95%CI: 1.090\u20134.197, p\u202f=\u202f0.027), hemorrhagic post-MACEs (OR: 1.778, 95%CI: 1.015\u20133.114, p\u202f=\u202f0.044), and 30-days mortality (OR: 3.593, 95%CI: 1.536\u20138.406, p\u202f=\u202f0.003).ConclusionIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that DM serves as a significant risk factor for ischemic post-MACEs, hemorrhagic post-MACEs, and 30-days mortality among patients with ICH.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
