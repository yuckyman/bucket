Enhanced working memory representations for rare events. <em>Psychophysiology</em>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038\">https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.70038</a> [<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.20.585952\">preprint</a>]</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">For decades, many ERP researchers have believed that the P3b wave (sometimes called P300) is a scalp manifestation of a process that updates working memory. This idea originated with Manny Donchin\u2019s <em>context updating</em> hypothesis of the P3b (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1981.tb01815.x\">Donchin, 1981</a>). Donchin\u2019s idea of <em>context</em> was pretty different from working memory, but as this hypothesis percolated through the field over time, it gradually morphed into the idea that the P3b reflects the updating of working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Rolf Verleger mounted a major attack on the original context updating hypothesis in a classic review article in BBS (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058015\">Verleger, 1988</a>), which was followed by a vigorous rebuttal by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00058027\">Donchin and Coles (1988)</a>. These are interesting papers to read, but they did not settle the issue. In the ensuing years, as the field became more focused on working memory instead of context, I\u2019m aware of no studies that directly tested the hypothesis that the P3b reflects working memory updating. </p><p class=\"\">One reason for the lack of direct evidence is that the oddball paradigms typically used to elicit the P3b do not provide a sensitive assessment of working memory. In a typical paradigm, for example, participants would see a sequence of 90% Xs and 10% Os, and the task would be to press one button for X and another button for O. The responses are made immediately, so it is not necessary to store the stimuli in working memory. Even if participants were asked to make a delayed response, the Xs and Os are so easily discriminable that memory performance would likely be at ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"698\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f1d6cee6-5eab-4240-bda0-1a2b7bf4bf88/Figure_1.png?format=1000w\" width=\"720\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 1</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">A few years ago, my lab (especially Carlos Carrasco, Aaron Simmons, and John Kiat) got interested in trying to test the working memory encoding hypothesis.

We used a modified oddball paradigm in which a little dot appeared at one of many locations around an circle (see Figure 1). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1112\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/f68d38c2-c87c-4512-b0a7-fbecd75969ff/Figure_2.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1728\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 2</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">On each trial, participants pressed one button if the circle was close to one of the four cardinal axes (left, right, top, and bottom) and a different button if it was close to one of the four diagonals (upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right). One of these two categories was rare (the <em>oddballs</em>) and the other was frequent (the <em>standards</em>; counterbalanced across trial blocks). As is usual in oddball paradigms, the P3b was much larger for trials in the rare category than for trials in the frequent category (see Figure 2).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1256\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/89260e9e-be6e-48b1-adc4-58b77a418deb/Figure_3.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1996\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 3</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">The main question was whether the location of the dot was encoded in working memory better for the oddball trials than for the standard trials. To assess this, the experimental design contained occasional <em>probe</em> trials on which participants used the mouse to click on the exact location of the dot (see Figure 3). That is, after participants made the cardinal/diagonal buttonpress responses, they were sometimes then asked to click on the remembered location of the dot. This happened on only 12.5% of trials, selected at random, so that participants would mainly focus on the oddball task. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/166f7236-f77b-431b-8ebf-9633580dcf31/Figure_4.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1800\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n          \n          <figcaption class=\"image-caption-wrapper\">\n            <p class=\"\">Figure 4</p>\n          </figcaption>\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We looked at the accuracy of these probe responses, calculated as the (absolute value of the) angular distance between the true location and the reported location. As shown in Figure 4, the response error of the probe responses was reduced for the oddball trials relative to the standard trials. In other words, working memory was better for the P3b-eliciting oddball trials than for the standards. Moreover, we found that participants with large P3b amplitudes on oddball trials had smaller response errors on oddball trials (whereas this correlation was not present for standards).</p><p class=\"\">At first glance, these findings seem like support for the idea that the P3b reflects working memory updating. However, the story is not that simple. For example, when we looked at single-trial P3b amplitudes, response errors were not lower for trials with larger P3b amplitudes than for trials with smaller P3b amplitudes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1122\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/a7a11955-3619-4499-9ef4-61f72a408561/Figure_5.png?format=1000w\" width=\"1378\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">We also used ERP decoding to test whether the exact location of the dot was better stored in working memory on oddball trials than on standard trials (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2023/6/23/decoding-webinar\">click here</a> for information about how ERP decoding works and how you can decode your own data using ERPLAB Toolbox). As shown in Figure 5, we could decode the location of the dot better on oddball trials than on standard trials during the period following the P3b component. Note, however, that this was a pretty small difference that only barely crossed the threshold for statistical significance (p = .048). I would really like to see this effect replicated before fully believing it. However, the behavioral effect was rock solid (and replicated in a follow-up experiment).</p><p class=\"\">What can we conclude from these findings? When we started the project, I knew that it would be difficult to draw any strong causal conclusions about the relationship between the P3b component and working memory updating. That is, even if we saw both a larger P3b and improved working memory on oddball trials, this would just be a correlation and could potentially be explained by a third variable such as attention. But if we saw a big difference in working memory between oddballs and standards, and if we found that working memory was better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes, this would be at least consistent with the idea that the process that produces the P3b on the scalp is also involved in working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">However, although we saw an enormous difference in P3b amplitude between oddball trials and standard trials, we saw only small differences in working memory between oddballs and standards, whether measured via behavioral response errors on probe trials or EEG decoding accuracy. If the process that generates the scalp P3b voltage plays a major role in working memory encoding, then we would have expected a much larger working memory difference between oddballs and standards. Moreover, although we found that participants with larger P3b amplitudes had smaller response errors, we did not find any evidence that working memory was any better on trials with larger P3b amplitudes (even though we looked very hard for such a relationship). The bottom line is that, although I was really hoping we would finally provide some direct evidence for the working memory encoding hypothesis, the results of this study have actually convinced me that the P3b is probably not related to working memory encoding.</p><p class=\"\">What, then, explains the small but statistically significant differences in working memory accuracy between oddballs and standards, along with the subjectwise correlation between P3b amplitude and behavioral response errors? A very plausible explanation is that both the P3b component and working memory encoding are facilitated by increased attention. That is, there are several sources of evidence that rare events trigger increased attention, and this could independently produce a larger P3b and improved working memory.</p><p class=\"\">Of course, this is just one experiment, so I wouldn\u2019t say that the working memory encoding hypothesis is completely dead. But given our new findings and the general lack of direct evidence for the hypothesis, it\u2019s on life support.</p><p class=\"\">If the P3b doesn\u2019t reflect working memory encoding, then what does it reflect? This seems like a significant question: the P3b is huge and is observed across a broad range of experimental paradigms, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the underlying process must be important for the brain to devote so many watts of energy to it. In fact, I find it embarrassing that our field has not answered this question in the 60 years since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.150.3700.1187\">the P3b was first discovered</a>.</p><p class=\"\">My best bet is that the P3b is related to the process of making decisions about actions (where the term <em>actions</em> is broadly construed to include the withholding of responses and mental actions such as counting). This is related to the fact that the amplitude of the P3b is related to the probability of a task-defined category, not the probability of a physical stimulus category. Rolf Verleger has a nice review of the evidence for this idea (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.13542\">Verleger, 2020</a>). But it is still not clear to me why the brain devotes so many watts of energy to creating a large P3b when a rare task-defined category occurs. Verleger notes that several hypotheses about the P3b are compatible with the finding of a larger P3b for oddballs than for standards, but in my view these hypotheses have a hard time explaining the enormous size of the P3b observed for oddballs. This is a longstanding mystery in need of a solution!</p>",

      "title": "Sleep Modulation: The Challenge of Transitioning from Open Loop to Closed Loop",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.03784v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Sleep disorders have emerged as a critical global health issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective and widely accessible intervention technologies. Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.03636v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: When face-to-face communication becomes effortful due to background noise or interfering talkers, the role of visual cues becomes increasingly important for communication success. While previous research has selectively examined head or hand movements, here we explore movements of the whole body in acoustically adverse conditions. We hypothesized that increasing background noise in conversations would lead to increased gesture frequency in hand, head, trunk, and leg movements typical of conversation. Increased use of hand movements should support the speaker's role, while increased head and trunk movements may help the listener. We conducted a free dyadic conversation experiment with normal-hearing participants (n=8) in a virtual acoustic environment. Conversational movements were described with a newly developed labeling system for typical conversational actions, and the frequency of individual types was analyzed. In addition, we analyzed gesture quality by assessing hand-speech synchrony, with the hypothesis that higher levels of background noise would lead to a loss of synchrony according to an interactive coupling model. Higher noise levels led to increased hand-gesture complexity during speaking and listening, more pronounced up-down head movements, and contrary to expectations, head movements during listening generally decreased relative to speaking. Synchrony and peak velocity were unaffected by noise, while gesture quality scaled only modestly. The results support previous findings regarding gesturing frequency, but we found only limited evidence for changes in speech-gesture synchrony. This work reveals communication patterns of the whole body and illustrates multimodal adaptation to communication demands.",

Recent developments in large language models (LLMs), with visual reasoning and UI navigation capabilities, present opportunities to automate CW. We explored whether LLMs (GPT-4 and Gemini-2.5-pro) can simulate human behavior in CW by comparing their walkthroughs with human participants. While LLMs could navigate interfaces and provide reasonable rationales, their behavior differed from humans. LLM-prompted CW achieved higher task completion rates than humans and followed more optimal navigation paths, while identifying fewer potential failure points. However, follow-up studies demonstrated that with additional prompting, LLMs can predict human-identified failure points, aligning their performance with human participants. Our work highlights that while LLMs may not replicate human behaviors exactly, they can be leveraged for scaling usability walkthroughs and providing UI insights, offering a valuable complement to traditional usability testing.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.03519v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Developing high-stakes autonomous systems that include Artificial Intelligence (AI) components is complex; the consequences of errors can be catastrophic, yet it is challenging to plan for all operational cases. In stressful scenarios for the human operator, such as short decision-making timescales, the risk of failures is exacerbated. A lack of understanding of AI failure modes obstructs this and so blocks the robust implementation of applications of AI in smart systems. This prevents early risk identification, leading to increased time, risk and cost of projects.\n  A key tenet of Systems Engineering and acquisition engineering is centred around a \"left-shift\" in test and evaluation activities to earlier in the system lifecycle, to allow for \"accelerated delivery of [systems] that work\". We argue it is therefore essential that this shift includes the analysis of AI failure cases as part of the design stages of the system life cycle. Our proposed framework enables the early characterisation of risks emerging from human-autonomy teaming (HAT) in operational contexts. The cornerstone of this is a new analysis of AI failure modes, built on the seminal modelling of human-autonomy teams laid out by LaMonica et al., 2022. Using the analysis of the interactions between human and autonomous systems and exploring the failure modes within each aspect, our approach provides a way to systematically identify human-AI interactions risks across the operational domain of the system of interest. The understanding of the emergent behaviour enables increased robustness of the system, for which the analysis should be undertaken over the whole scope of its operational design domain. This approach is illustrated through an example use case for an AI assistant supporting a Command & Control (C2) System.",

However, existing sequence mining techniques fall short of the urgent need to explore the behavior progression of different groups (e.g., recovery or deterioration groups) and track the potential long-term impact of behaviors on mental health status. To address this issue, we introduce EMINDS, a visual analytics system built on a novel automatic mining pipeline that extracts distinct behavior stages and assesses the potential impact of frequent stage patterns on mental health status over time. The system includes a set of interactive visualizations that summarize the meaning of each behavior stage and the evolution of different stage patterns. We feature a pattern-centric Sankey diagram to reveal contextual information about the impact of stage patterns on mental health, helping experts understand the specific changes in sequences before and after a stage pattern. We evaluated the effectiveness and usability of EMINDS through two case studies and expert interviews, which examined the potential stage patterns impacting long-term mental health by analyzing user behaviors on Reddit.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.03485v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Cell state discovery is crucial for understanding biological systems and enhancing medical outcomes. A key aspect of this process is identifying distinct biomarkers that define specific cell states. However, difficulties arise from the co-discovery process of cell states and biomarkers: biologists often use dimensionality reduction to visualize cells in a two- dimensional space. Then they usually interpret visually clustered cells as distinct states, from which they seek to identify unique biomarkers. However, this assumption is often invalid due to internal inconsistencies in a cluster, making the process trial-and-error and highly uncertain. Therefore, biologists urgently need effective tools to help uncover the hidden association relationships between different cell populations and their potential biomarkers. To address this problem, we first designed a machine-learning algorithm based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique to identify meaningful associations between cell populations and biomarkers. We further developed a visual analytics system, CellScout, in collaboration with biologists, to help them explore and refine these association relationships to advance cell state discovery. We validated our system through expert interviews, from which we further selected a representative case to demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering new cell states.",

Drawing on the Health Belief Model (HBM), this study examined belief-based predictors of intention to use GAI and therapists across two populations: a university sample (N = 1,155) and a nationally representative adult sample (N = 651). Using repeated-measures ANOVA and LASSO regression, we found that therapists were consistently valued for emotional, relational, and personalization benefits, while GAI was favored for accessibility and affordability. Yet structural advantages alone did not predict adoption; emotional benefit and personalization emerged as decisive factors. Adoption patterns diverged across groups: students treated GAI as a complement, whereas national adults approached it as a substitute. Concerns about privacy and reliability constrained GAI use in both groups. These findings extend HBM to multi-modality contexts and highlight design implications for trustworthy, emotionally resonant digital mental health tools.",

To address this, we interviewed 14 educators, including 13 certificated Teachers of Students with Visual Impairments (TVIs) and 1 paraeducator, who learned braille as adults. We found that they: (1) lack consistent braille exposure to reinforce knowledge and skill; (2) have limited time to practice due to myriad responsibilities of adulthood; and thus, (3) seek learning tools that are engaging and efficient.

When the phone vibrates, applied finger force modulates the amplitude of high frequency accelerometer and gyroscope signals through Vibrometric Force Estimation. We profiled a Google Pixel 4 using synchronized IMU data and ground truth force measurements across varied force trajectories, then trained ridge regression models for both absolute and relative force prediction. In 15 fold hold one out validation, absolute force estimation achieved a mean absolute error of 1.88 lbs, while relative force estimation achieved a mean error of 10.1%. Although the method captures pinch type force rather than standardized full hand HGS, the results demonstrate the feasibility of smartphone based strength assessment using only on device sensors. This approach may enable large scale, low burden functional health measurements once profiling is completed for major smartphone models.",

This includes predictive coding and hierarchical Gaussian filtering (HGF), which differ in the nature of hierarchical representations. In this work, we present a new class of artificial neural networks that unifies computational principles of PC and HGFs. We extend the space of generative models underlying HGF to include a form of nonlinear hierarchical coupling between state values akin to predictive coding and artificial neural networks in general. We derive the update equations corresponding to this generalization of HGF and conceptualize them as connecting a network of (belief) nodes where parent nodes either predict the state of child nodes or their rate of change. This enables us to (1) create modular architectures with generic computational steps in each node of the network, and (2) disclose the hierarchical message passing implied by generalized HGF models and to compare this to comparable schemes under predictive coding. The practical advances of this work are twofold: on the one hand, our extension allows for a modular construction of ANNs of arbitrarily complex hierarchical structure under the general principles of HGF. On the other hand, by providing a highly flexible implementation of hierarchical Bayesian models available as open source software, it enables new types of empirical data analysis in computational psychiatry.",

However, these models have many free parameters that must be estimated for each cell, and existing fitting methods rely on intracellular voltage measurements that are highly challenging to obtain in vivo. Recent advances in neural recording technology with high-density probes and arrays enable dense sampling of extracellular voltage from many sites surrounding a neuron, allowing indirect measurement of many compartments of a cell simultaneously. Here, we propose a method for inferring the underlying membrane voltage, biophysical parameters, and the neuron's position relative to the probe, using extracellular measurements alone. We use an Extended Kalman Filter to infer membrane voltage and channel states using efficient, differentiable simulators. Then, we learn the model parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood using gradient-based methods. We demonstrate the performance of this approach using simulated data and real neuron morphologies.",

      "title": "Implicit Generative Modeling by Kernel Similarity Matching",
      "content": "arXiv:2503.00655v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Understanding how the brain encodes stimuli has been a fundamental problem in computational neuroscience. Insights into this problem have led to the design and development of artificial neural networks that learn representations by incorporating brain-like learning abilities. Recently, learning representations by capturing similarity between input samples has been studied to tackle this problem. This approach, however, has thus far been used to only learn downstream features from an input and has not been studied in the context of a generative paradigm, where one can map the representations back to the input space, incorporating not only bottom-up interactions (stimuli to latent) but also learning features in a top-down manner (latent to stimuli). We investigate a kernel similarity matching framework for generative modeling. Starting with a modified sparse coding objective for learning representations proposed in prior work, we demonstrate that representation learning in this context is equivalent to maximizing similarity between the input kernel and a latent kernel. We show that an implicit generative model arises from learning the kernel structure in the latent space and show how the framework can be adapted to learn manifold structures, potentially providing insights as to how task representations can be encoded in the brain. To solve the objective, we propose a novel Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm and discuss the interpretation of the optimization process. Finally, we discuss how this representation learning problem can lead towards a biologically plausible architecture to learn the model parameters that ties together representation learning using similarity matching (a bottom-up approach) with predictive coding (a top-down approach).",

      "title": "Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states of Path-structured Flow in Directed Brain Synaptic Networks",
      "content": "arXiv:2410.18222v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The brain's synaptic network, characterized by parallel connections and feedback loops, drives interaction pathways between neurons through a large system with infinitely many degrees of freedom. This system is best modeled by the graph C*-algebra of the underlying directed graph, the Toeplitz-Cuntz-Krieger (TCK) algebra, which captures the diversity of path-structured flow connectivity. Equipped with the gauge action, the TCK algebra defines an {\\em algebraic quantum system}, and here we demonstrate that its thermodynamic properties provide a natural framework for describing the dynamic mappings of potential flow pathways within the network. Specifically, the KMS states of this system represent the stationary distributions of a non-Markovian stochastic process with memory decay, capturing how influence propagates along exponentially weighted paths, and yield global statistical measures of neuronal interactions. Applied to the {\\em C. elegans} synaptic network, our framework reveals that neurolocomotor neurons emerge as the primary hubs of incoming path-structured flow at inverse temperatures where the entropy of KMS states peaks. This finding aligns with experimental evidence of the foundational role of locomotion in {\\em C. elegans} behavior, suggesting that functional centrality may arise from the topological embedding of neurons rather than solely from local physiological properties. Our results highlight the potential of algebraic quantum methods and graph algebras to uncover patterns of functional organization in complex systems and neuroscience.",

      "title": "Sleep Modulation: The Challenge of Transitioning from Open Loop to Closed Loop",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.03784v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Sleep disorders have emerged as a critical global health issue, highlighting the urgent need for effective and widely accessible intervention technologies. Non-invasive brain stimulation has garnered attention as it enables direct or indirect modulation of neural activity, thereby promoting sleep enhancement in a safe and unobtrusive manner. This class of approaches is collectively referred to as sleep modulation. To date, the majority of sleep modulation research relies on open-loop paradigms with empirically determined parameters, while achieving individual adaptation and modulation accuracy remains a distant objective. The paradigm-specific constraints inherent to open-loop designs represent a major obstacle to clinical translation and large-scale deployment in home environments. In this paper, we delineate fundamental paradigms of sleep modulation, critically examine the intrinsic limitations of open-loop approaches, and formally conceptualize sleep closed-loop modulation. We further provide a comprehensive synthesis of prior studies involving five commonly employed modulation techniques, evaluating their potential integration within a closed-loop framework. Finally, we identify three primary challenges in constructing an effective sleep closed-loop modulation system: sensor solution selection, monitoring model design, and modulation strategy design, while also proposing potential solutions. Collectively, this work aims to advance the paradigm shift of sleep modulation from open-loop toward closed-loop systems.",
