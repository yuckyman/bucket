      "title": "Neuroinvasion by Simian Immunodeficiency Virus Triggers Glial Senescence and Accelerated Neurodegeneration",
      "content": "Virus-induced accelerated aging has emerged as a potential contributor to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), despite widespread implementation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Although evidence of accelerated aging in people living with HIV (PLWH) has been reported, most investigations of acute infection rely on in vitro systems or small animal models, leaving a critical gap in understanding early neuropathological events. To address this, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissues from rhesus macaques acutely infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We focused on two key aging-related proteins: the cellular senescence marker p16INK4a (p16) and the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We hypothesized that accelerated aging phenotypes would be detectable during acute infection, manifesting as increased p16 expression and altered SIRT1 levels, correlating with neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed marked upregulation of GFAP and p16, along with evidence of neurodegeneration, across multiple brain regions - including the frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum - by 21 days post-infection. These findings suggest that aging-related and senescence pathways are activated almost immediately following HIV infection, highlighting the potential importance of astrocyte- or CNS-specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate early neuropathology.",

      "title": "The Overlap Area as a Novel Measure of Effect Size in Neuroscience Research",
      "content": "In experimental biomedical research, a common concern is whether a manipulation produces a biologically meaningful effect. Another concern is whether effect sizes are reliable, statistically significant, and generalizable. Traditional effect size measures, such as Cohens d, quantify mean differences but ignore variance heterogeneity between groups. This can result in biased effect size estimates and a lack of thresholds for statistical significance testing. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel effect size measure, termed overlap area (OA), which quantifies the difference between the population distributions of the experimental and control groups. A robust Bayesian method estimated OA, and random resampling determined OA thresholds for statistical significance in single and replicated experiments. Simulations confirmed the approach's sensitivity and robustness. Applied to a real-world dataset, OA revealed that environmental enrichment affects the mouse brain synaptome. Moreover, we developed an open-source toolbox supporting OA as a powerful new measurement for conducting robust, reliable, and reproducible analyses of manipulation effects in neuroscience and related fields.",

This tool replaces some of the english words with Japanese vocabulary based on your japanese level (Similar to Toucan, but with a better user experience).<p>It\u2019s basically an attempt to make the \"i+1\" method actually passive, you understand the sentence because it's mostly english, but you pick up Japanese words naturally from the context. It uses an LLM in the backend to make sure the translations fit the context (so it distinguishes between different meanings of the same word).<p>since it uses paid AI APIs for the words replacement, I couldn't make it 100% free (server costs are real, unfortunately). However, there is a \"forever free\" plan with daily credits that doesn't require a credit card. it should be enough for casual daily browsing.<p>I built this because I struggle with Anki burnout and wanted a way to review words without feeling like i am \"studying\"<p>It supports Chrome, Edge, and Firefox now. would love any feedback or feature requests!<p><a href=\"https://lingoku.ai/learn-japanese\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://lingoku.ai/learn-japanese</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46296863\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46296863</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Neural geometric representations of social memory for multi-individuals in medial prefrontal cortex",
      "content": "Social memory is an ability to recognize specific identities and remember experience with acquainted individuals. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of key brain areas executing this function. However, it is unknown how mPFC neurons encode multiple social identities. By developing a new social-identity discrimination task, where a mouse encounters four conspecifics along with in vivo recordings of mPFC neuron spiking activity, we, here, report that the memory of individual social identities can maintain up to two weeks and are robustly encoded by tuned geometric subspaces in mPFC population activity. On contrary, only few neurons exhibit exclusively social-selective responses. Using a cross-session alignment approach of the linear regression and joint-dimensionality reduction, we identify specific low-dimensional neural-subspaces differentially representing individuals over days. Importantly, shifts in social valence, caused by conditioning rewarding, aversive or neutral stimuli associated with different interacted individuals, significantly increase distance and angle between each neural-subspaces. The latter changes in neural representations result from progressive recruitments of neurons that encode associated information of individual valence and identity. Thus, our findings elucidate that tuned neural subspaces in the mPFC underlie a stable encoding of multiple social identities over days, providing a computational framework for understanding complex social memory.",

      "title": "Repeated stress persistently suppressesthe central node in the courtship circuitry in Drosophila",
      "content": "Stress caused by external stressors, such as painful stimulation, can elicit a drastic set of behavioral responses. Such stress responses normally decay soon after the stressor disappears, but can become persistent when the stressor becomes longer and/or repeated. The neuronal mechanism underlying the persistence of stress responses, however, remains elusive. Here, we discovered that repeated electric shocks persistently suppress male Drosophila's courtship behavior. We comprehensively evaluated the physiological changes in the genetically defined courtship circuitry, and found that a courtship-triggering node of the circuitry, called P1 neurons, is preferentially and persistently suppressed following electric shocks. Our data uncovers in a comprehensively defined courtship circuitry that repeated stress persistently suppresses a critical node of the circuitry in a targeted fashion to alter behavior.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Inhibition of FKBP51 Mitigates Early Life Adversity-Induced Social Deficits",
      "content": "Early life adversity (ELA) is a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders, but targeted preventative strategies are lacking due to poor mechanistic insight. The FKBP51 protein, a co-chaperone of the glucocorticoid receptor, is a key mediator of stress vulnerability. We tested if pharmacological inhibition of FKBP51 with the selective inhibitor SAFit2 prevents the long-term consequences of ELA. Mice exposed to ELA exhibited persistent deficits in social behavior, manifesting as social subordination in adolescence and adulthood. Early-life SAFit2 treatment fully rescued these ELA-induced behavioral impairments. Transcriptional profiling across six stress-relevant brain regions revealed that SAFit2 normalized ELA-driven gene expression changes, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Functional analysis showed the rescue converged on immunoregulatory and neuroactive ligand-receptor signaling pathways. Our findings establish FKBP51 as a critical pharmacological target for reversing the lasting impact of early life adversity on brain function, offering a path toward preventative treatment for ELA-related psychopathology.",

      "title": "Single-cell transcriptomics and mouse model phenotyping for biomarker screen of peripheral blood biomarkers in Huntington disease",
      "content": "Transcriptional dysregulation is among the most prominent molecular alterations in Huntington disease (HD). It is not confined to brain but is also extended to peripheral tissues and cells, enabling minimally invasive screens aimed at identifying transcriptional surrogates of the health status in HD mutation carriers. Nonetheless, transcriptomics approaches have failed to identify consistent candidates from peripheral blood, probably due to the low impact of the HD mutation in the transcriptional profiles of circulating cells that can be masked by the high cellular complexity of this biofluid. In this study, we applied for the first time single-cell RNA-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine those cells that accumulate the most prominent gene expression changes as potential sources of reliable biomarkers. We observed both specific and common transcriptional alterations across different blood cell subtypes, justifying partial overlapping of our results with published bulk transcriptomics datasets. To relate these gene expression patterns with disease progression in the absence of a large cohort of patients, we examined selected candidates in a phenotypically characterized cohort of transgenic R6/1 mice. Of the tested genes, only the changes in the interferon related gene Irf7 in blood were correlated with motor coordination performance in mutant mice. Notably, this gene was significantly upregulated in the striatum of these animals. Overall, transcriptional-based changes in peripheral blood can be linked to HD although dissection of individual blood cells in combination with subsequent validation in mouse models emphasizes the challenges in obtaining clinically relevant biomarkers in HD.",
