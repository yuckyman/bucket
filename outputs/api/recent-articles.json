      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Pharmacological and Physiological Characteristics of Synaptic Transmissions from the Medial Prefrontal Cortex onto Noradrenergic Neurons and Their Presynaptic Neurons in the Mouse Locus Coeruleus",
      "content": "The locus coeruleus (LC) is the primary source of norepinephrine in the brain and is known to modulate brain-wide arousal state. Recent evidence suggests that it also regulates immediate attentional responses by resetting related cortical networks to optimize behavioral outcomes. Cortical regions of high cognitive function, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), are theorized to directly influence LC output for the purpose of behavioral regulation. However, the available evidence is insufficient to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and properties. To provide further comprehensive data on this issue, we combined ex vivo whole-cell recording with an optogenetic approach to study the synaptic transmission of mPFC inputs to LC neurons, including noradrenergic (NA) neurons and GABAergic neurons presynaptic to them (preLC neurons). Our findings indicate that the mPFC exhibits monosynaptic connections with both NA and GABAergic preLC neurons. These synaptic connections demonstrate cell-type-specific disparities in glutamate release properties. In comparison to those on GABAergic preLC neurons, the mPFC fibers synapsing on LC-NA exhibit a lower release probability (higher paired-pulse ratio) and demonstrate a presynaptic enhancement of glutamate release efficacy during behavior. The features of simultaneous connections onto LC-NA and GABAergic preLC neurons, which exhibit cell-type-specific differences in plastic function of the transmitter release, enable the mPFC to effectively multiplex information to the LC for the adaptive regulation of behavior.",

      "title": "Region-specific proteomic analysis of aging rhesus macaques following chronic glutamate-carboxypeptidase-II (GCPII) inhibition elucidates potential treatment strategies for sporadic Alzheimer's disease",
      "content": "Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) lacks effective preventive therapies, underscoring the need to target pathogenic drivers. Aberrant calcium signaling is an established early event in sAD pathogenesis that is closely linked to neuroinflammation. Aged rhesus macaques are predominantly APOE-{epsilon}4 homozygotes and naturally exhibit cognitive decline, calcium dysregulation, amyloid deposition, and tau pathology, which allows for a translationally relevant animal model. We previously identified an evolutionarily expanded role for postsynaptic type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR3) in dorsolateral prefrontal and entorhinal cortex, where they regulate cAMP-calcium opening of K+ channels to sustain neuronal firing and working memory. mGluR3 signaling is driven by N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and constrained by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), whose expression rises with age and inflammation. In prior work, chronic inhibition of GCPII with the orally bioavailable inhibitor 2-(3-mercaptopropyl) pentanedioic acid (2-MPPA) improved neuronal firing, working memory, and reduced pT217Tau pathology in aged macaques. Here, we employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to define the proteomic consequences of chronic 2-MPPA treatment in vulnerable (entorhinal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) versus resilient (primary visual cortex) regions. We identified >2,400 proteins across experimental conditions, and label-free quantification revealed region-specific differential expression patterns paralleling known vulnerability gradients in sAD. Gene ontology enrichment of vulnerable regions implicated pathways governing protein deneddylation, amyloid and tau-associated processes, synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial homeostasis, and oxidative stress, revealing putative targets for therapeutic intervention in sAD. These findings demonstrate that GCPII inhibition engages distinct, region-selective molecular programs in the aging primate cortex, consistent with the protection of circuits most vulnerable to sAD. By mapping the proteomic shifts that occur with treatment, we reveal molecular signatures that not only serve as candidate biomarkers but also highlight novel mechanistic pathways contributing to calcium-driven degeneration in sAD. As such, more focused investigations into these pathways of therapeutic interest are warranted, in addition to the analysis of key post-translational modifications and their potential roles in sAD.",

      "content": "Emotional reactions to norm violations influence how people trade-off selfish interests against social norms, but it remains unknown which brain regions causally contribute to integrating physiological arousal associated with norm violations into the decision process. Here, we provide evidence that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) causally contributes to decoupling value computations in normative choice from physiological arousal. Excitatory brain stimulation over the vmPFC reduced aversion to disadvantageous inequality in an Ultimatum game and increased post-decision confidence after acceptance of unfair monetary splits. Physiological arousal as measured via heart rate changes was increased in response to splits perceived as unfair. Enhancing vmPFC excitability reduced the sensitivity to unfairness not by directly inhibiting physiological arousal but by blocking its influence on the decision process. This suggests that vmPFC causally moderates how physiological responses to norm violations affect trade-offs between self-interests and norm considerations, highlighting its key role for integrating emotional and cognitive processes in decision making.",

      "title": "Alcohol dependence-induced neuroadaptations in prelimbic KV7 channels contribute to working memory deficits in mice",
      "content": "Chronic alcohol use can cause executive function deficits, such as diminished working memory, which can facilitate excessive alcohol intake and elevate relapse probability even in prolonged withdrawal. Unfortunately, current FDA-approved medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) are not designed to also treat alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction. KV7 channels are a class of voltage-gated potassium channels that regulate neuronal excitability and are implicated in cognitive function. KV7 channels are sensitive to acute and chronic alcohol exposure, and positive KV7 channel modulation reduces alcohol intake in high-drinking rodents. The impact of chronic alcohol exposure on KV7 physiology in the prelimbic cortex (PL), a region essential for cognitive function, remains unexplored. To address this, cognitive deficits were measured in male and female mice following the chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) model of alcohol dependence using a delayed alternation working memory task. After establishing that CIE elicits cognitive deficits regardless of sex, whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology recordings were performed on distinct PL pyramidal neurons; intratelencephalic (IT neurons) and extratelencephalic (ET neurons) projection neurons to measure KV7 channel mediated M-currents, along with evoked action potential firing following chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure in male and female mice. CIE exposure led to an increase in intrinsic excitability and a decrease in M-current regardless of sex, which was largely driven by CIE-induced adaptations in IT neurons. These neural adaptations in dependent mice coincided with the emergence of working memory deficits. Microinjections of the KV7 positive modulator retigabine restored working memory function in male and female CIE-exposed mice. Together, these results indicate that chronic alcohol downregulates KV7 function within distinct cortical cell types, and that KV7 modulation may be a promising pharmacological treatment for alcohol induced cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Modelling the effect of V1a receptor antagonism and its potential therapeutic effect in circadian disorders",
      "content": "Background: The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central circadian clock in mammals, regulating many daily physiological and behavioral rhythms. Dysregulation of the SCN is associated with various circadian disorders, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting its neurons and output pathways. Vasopressin signaling is one of the main regulators of the synchronicity and the functional output of the SCN. Methods: We investigated the effect of a single dose (30mg/kg) of the vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist, balovaptan, on resynchronization of locomotor activity rhythms in mice after a 6-hour phase advance of the light-dark cycle. To mechanistically model the effect of V1aR antagonism, we developed a mathematical framework simulating the SCN, its control of circadian biomarkers (melatonin, core body temperature), and the impact of V1aR antagonism. Results: A single administration of the V1a antagonist balovaptan significantly accelerated resynchronization of locomotor activity rhythms to new light-dark cycles. To mechanistically understand this effect, we devised a mathematical model of the SCN that successfully captures this accelerated synchronization of circadian rhythms under V1aR antagonism. Additionally, the model replicates well-established SCN behaviors in both humans and rodents, including the phase response curve triggered by a light pulse at various circadian phases, and the desynchronization of the SCN observed in forced desynchronization experiments. Mechanistically, our model suggests that weakening vasopressin signaling via V1aR antagonism strengthens the SCN's resistance to internal desynchronization. Additionally, our model suggests a strong link between the endogenous period (tau) and the phase of circadian biomarkers, with longer tau values resulting in delayed biomarker rhythms. Importantly, the model predicts that V1aR antagonism induces a phase advance proportional to tau. The model predicts that individuals with longer endogenous periods, who consequently exhibit greater phase delays in their circadian rhythms, could experience more substantial phase advances in response to V1aR antagonism. Discussion: We show that targeting V1aR is enough to cause a faster resynchronization to a new light-dark cycle in the jet lag paradigm and establish a computational framework for investigating its therapeutic potential in circadian rhythm disorders. This framework, adaptable to incorporate pharmacodynamic data, can be used to design clinical trials evaluating V1aR antagonism for treating circadian disorders.",
