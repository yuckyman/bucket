      "title": "First In Vivo Demonstration of Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery of Memantine Using NosaPlugs Nasal Inserts",
      "content": "Treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge due to ineffective drug delivery to the brain. In recent years, intranasal administration has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for nose-to-brain delivery. Compared to other routes of administration, nose-to-brain delivery provides a possibility of bypassing both the blood-brain-barrier and the first-pass metabolism in the liver, allowing for a decrease in the delivered dose and thereby a reduced risk of systemic side-effects. While the most common nasal devices, spray pumps, ensure a wide distribution in the nasal cavity and a fast onset of action, a slower release and increased retention time is desired for treatment of many neurological disorders. In this study, we tested the feasibility of a novel nasal insert, NosaPlugs, for prolonged release and delivery of memantine. Using an in vitro anatomically realistic nasal model, we demonstrated cumulative release of memantine from the nasal inserts up to eight hours. Additionally, the therapeutic substance was distributed to all parts of the nasal cavity, with higher amounts accumulating in the middle part. In vivo, an acute dose of memantine in the gas phase released from the nasal device reached pharmacologically relevant levels in both plasma and the brains of the mice. Future research should investigate the release and delivery of alternative substances interesting for brain diseases, and larger animal models are required to determine the efficacy of nose-to-brain delivery using NosaPlugs nasal inserts. Importantly, our study provides the first proof-of-concept that NosaPlugs can serve as an effective intranasal device for targeted drug delivery to the brain.",

      "title": "Calcium-binding protein expression alone is insufficient to identify and classify GABAergic neurons in macaque cortex",
      "content": "Understanding neuron subclasses and their functional consequences can contribute to understanding brain circuits. A scheme long used to classify GABAergic neurons in the neocortex is based on expression of three calcium-binding proteins (CBPs): parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR). Because CB and CR are frequently co-expressed by individual neurons in rodents, this scheme has been replaced by one based on PV and two signaling peptides: somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In macaques, however, CBPs are generally not co-expressed, and so their use has persisted despite suggestions that the underlying populations are not, in fact, entirely GABAergic. We set out to quantitatively evaluate CBPs as a classification scheme for GABAergic neurons in early and mid-level visual regions in macaque cortex. Combining immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we find that up to half of neurons expressing CBPs are likely not GABAergic. Furthermore, contrary to what has been previously suggested, the GABAergic subpopulations cannot be distinguished based on staining intensity. Thus, the CBP-based classification scheme is not valid, at least as it has traditionally been used. Instead, we find support for co-labeling CB and CR neurons with SST and VIP, an approach that can identify GABAergic subpopulations within the CBP classes; or simply adopting the PV/SST/VIP scheme. We discuss the functional implications of expressing these various cell type markers, and how consideration of marker functions can support proper selection of a classification scheme for a given experimental purpose.",

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "content": "<p>I\u2019ve been experimenting with embedding an Claude Code/Cursor-style coding agent directly into the browser.<p>At a high level, the agent generates and maintains userscripts and CSS that are re-applied on page load. Rather than just editing DOM via JS in console the agent is treating the page, and the DOM as a file.<p>The models are often trained in RL sandboxes with full access to the filesystem and bash, so they are really good at using it. So to make the agent behave well, I've simulated this environment.<p>The whole state of a page and scripts is implemented as a virtual filesystem hacked on top of browser.local storage. URL is mapped to directories, and the agent starts inside this directory. It has the tools to read/edit files, grep around and a fake bash command that is just used for running scripts and executing JS code.<p>I've tested only with Opus 4.5 so far, and it works pretty reliably.\nThe state of the file system can be synced to the real filesystem, although because Firefox doesn't support Filesystem API, you need to manually import the fs contents first.<p>This agent is <i>really</i> useful for extracting things to CSV, but it's also can be used for fun.<p>Demo: <a href=\"https://x.com/ichebykin/status/2015686974439608607\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://x.com/ichebykin/status/2015686974439608607</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46800484\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46800484</a></p>\n<p>Points: 9</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
