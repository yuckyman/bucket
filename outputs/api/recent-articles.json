      "title": "Predictive vision-language integration in the human visual cortex",
      "content": "Integrating linguistic and visual information is a core function of human cognition, yet how information from these two modalities interacts in the brain remains largely unknown. Competing frameworks, including the hub-and-spoke model and Bayesian theories such as predictive coding, offer conflicting accounts of how the brain achieves multimodal integration. To address this question, we collected a large-scale fMRI dataset and leveraged state-of-the-art AI systems to construct encoding models that probe how the human brain matches and integrates linguistic and visual information. We found that prior information from one modality can modulate neural responses in another, even in the early visual cortex (EVC). Integration neural response in EVC is governed by prediction errors consistent with predictive coding theory. Enhanced and suppressed neural responses to semantically matched cross-modal stimuli were found in distinct EVC populations, with suppression population carrying denser, behaviorally relevant semantic information. Both populations support semantic integration with distinct temporal dynamics and representational structures. These findings provide representational- and computational-level insights into how the brain integrates information across modalities, revealing unified principles of information processing that link biological and artificial intelligence.",

      "title": "Test-Retest Reliability of Dopaminergic fPET and fMRI Measures During Reward Processing",
      "content": "Reward processing is essential to human brain function, with dopamine signalling in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) as key element. The monetary incentive delay task is widely studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measuring indirect hemodynamic changes. Functional positron emission tomography (fPET) with 6-[18F]FDOPA directly quantifies dopamine synthesis enabling dynamic assessment during task performance within a single scan. We investigated the reliability of 6-[18F]FDOPA fPET and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI during a modified monetary incentive delay task in 25 healthy participants across two PET/MRI sessions. Intraclass correlation coefficients and coefficients of variance were computed for BOLD beta estimates and striatal dopamine synthesis at 30s and 2s resolutions. fPET showed fair to good reliability in the NAcc and putamen at rest, fair reliability during the win condition in the caudate and putamen, but poor reliability across the loss condition in all regions. Conversely, fMRI showed good reliability in the NAcc during feedback and in the caudate during feedback loss, but fair reliability elsewhere except for poor reliability in the caudate during cue loss. These findings indicate that both methods achieve comparable reliability but in different target areas, with the molecular specificity of fPET offering dynamic assessment of dopaminergic function.",

      "title": "Pitch selectivity in ferret auditory cortex",
      "content": "Our perception of pitch, the tonal quality of a sound at a fundamental frequency (F0), is essential for musical melody, vocal communication, and attending to a voice in a crowded room. Pitch is distinct from simple frequency tuning. Although pitch perception can arise from either harmonic spectral structure or temporal regularity, it remains unclear how individual neurons represent these distinct cues. We recorded spiking activity in hundreds of ferret auditory cortical neurons while systematically varying harmonic and temporal pitch cues. A subset of neurons represented F0 based on harmonic content, another subset on temporal periodicity, and a third population exhibited invariant pitch tuning across both cue classes. These findings provide the first evidence for specialized pitch neurons in non-primates, and demonstrate that mammalian auditory cortex employs dual spectral-temporal mechanisms for extracting F0.",

      "title": "AHA1 regulates A\u03b2 production via modulation of APP expression and \u03b3-secretase assembly",
      "content": "Deposition of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), produced by gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) co-chaperone, activator of Hsp90 ATPase homolog 1 (AHA1), is known to promote the accumulation of toxic tau species; however, its effects on Abeta production remain unclear. Here, we show that knockdown of endogenous AHA1 decreases Abeta generation and reduces APP and gamma-secretase components, whereas AHA1 overexpression elevates Abeta production and the expression of these proteins. The AHA1-E67K mutant, which has impaired Hsp90 binding, lowers Abeta production and the levels of APP and gamma-secretase components compared with wild-type AHA1. AHA1 associates with APP and immature gamma-secretase components, including anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1 (APH1), indicating its role in APP proteolysis and Abeta production. Disruption of the AHA1/Hsp90 complex - through AHA1 knockdown, the E67K mutant, or a small-molecule inhibitor - reduces gamma-secretase assembly. Familial AD mutations in APP-C99 and presenilin-1 (PS1) increase AHA1, Hsp90, APP, and APH1 expression, enhancing Abeta production. Importantly, AHA1 knockdown decreases abnormal Abeta generation and C99, PS1-CTF, and APH1 levels in mutant APP cells, while AHA1 overexpression enhances Abeta production in PS1 mutant cells. Collectively, these findings reveal that AHA1 regulates Abeta production by modulating APP expression and gamma-secretase assembly, establishing AHA1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in AD.",

      "content": "Cortical prosthetic systems offer a promising path to restoring vision in blindness by stimulating neurons in the visual cortex to evoke visual percepts. To effectively encode visual information, however, it is essential to target neurons based on their functional encoding properties. Current stimulation protocols focus on retinotopic information, ignoring other key encoding properties, and therefore fail to reproduce complex visual percepts. We demonstrate that incorporating orientation selectivity alongside retinotopy to guide stimulation dramatically improves fidelity of the evoked activity to the underlying neural code. We propose a Bottlenecked Rotation-Equivariant CNN (BRCNN) and demonstrate that neural responses can be predicted to a large degree using only retinotopy and orientation preference. Using this model, we design a retinotopy-and-orientation aware stimulation protocol and validate it in a state-of-the-art large-scale optogenetic stimulation simulation framework of primary visual cortex. Our protocol elicits neural activity patterns exhibiting substantially higher correlation with natural vision responses compared to retinotopic-only approaches.",

      "title": "Mechanistic Link between Executive Functions and Higher Cognition: Evidence from Psychometric Modeling and Brain Stimulation",
      "content": "Human cognitive abilities depend on flexible coordination across distributed cognitive control systems within the frontoparietal network, yet the causal architecture linking executive functions (EFs) to higher cognition remains debated. We combined psychometric modeling and neuromodulation to test causal contributions of EFs to distinct cognitive abilities. In a psychometric study, we modeled Unity-Diversity EF components (updating, inhibition, shifting) against four Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) group factors. Fluid reasoning (Gf) was uniquely related to both Common EF and Updating-specific variance, whereas visual processing (Gv) and processing speed (Gs) were primarily linked to Common EF; crystallized ability (Gc) proved to be largely independent of EFs. To causally probe this architecture, in neuromodulatory study we applied anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over prefrontal and parietal hubs of the frontoparietal network. tDCS selectively enhanced working memory updating, with right-hemisphere stimulation improving Gv but reducing Gf performance. Mediation analyses revealed that working memory updating mediated tDCS effects on higher cognition, yet the direction of effects varied across hemispheres and ability domains, exposing indirect, updating-driven facilitative and compensatory mechanisms within the frontoparietal network. Together, these findings bridge psychometric and neuromodulatory approaches to advance mechanistic understanding of how EFs support higher cognition.",

      "title": "Epigenetic control of microglial developmental milestones from proliferative progenitors to efficient phagocytes",
      "content": "Early immune perturbations increase the risk of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying the maturation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain parenchyma, remain poorly defined. Specifically, how proliferation, morphological differentiation, and phagocytosis are coordinated among microglia progenitors as they colonize the embryonic brain remains unclear. Here, we combined mathematical modeling with spatiotemporal analyses of the murine hippocampus and cerebellum from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P60 to reconstruct the trajectory of microglial development. We identified a proliferative-to-quiescent (P/Q) switch around P3/P4 that preceded the acquisition of morphological complexity and efficient phagocytosis and was accompanied by coordinated shifts in cell-cycle dynamics and metabolic state. Strikingly, this P/Q switch was recapitulated in repopulation contexts in mice and in the human fetal brain, where later stages displayed enhanced phagocytic function coupled to reduced proliferation. Perturbing the proliferative phase through pharmacological or genetic disruption of CSF1R signaling impaired subsequent microglial complexity and phagocytosis efficiency, revealing an unexpected reliance of phagocytosis on proliferation-driven colonization. Finally, we show that microglia stepwise maturation during development is associated with chromatin remodeling and driven by the epigenetic regulator Ikaros. Together, these findings uncover the sequential milestones of microglial development, revealing a potential period of early vulnerability and establishing an unexpected linkage between proliferation and phagocytosis essential to understanding how these processes are coordinated in neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "title": "Dopamine D1Aa and D2a Receptor Expression in the Auditory System of a Vocal Fish",
      "content": "Although dopamine receptors (DARs) have been identified in various vertebrate neural circuits, their expression in the central auditory system remains poorly characterized. Reproductive-state changes in catecholamine innervation of central auditory nuclei in the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus) highlight a unique, ethologically relevant role for catecholamines, including dopamine, in modulating auditory function to enhance reproductive success. Dopamines effects on these systems are mediated via its receptors; thus, the goal of the present study is to characterize excitatory dopamine D1Aa and inhibitory dopamine D2a receptor transcript expression throughout the central auditory system of the plainfin midshipman. Fluorescence in situ hybridization-immunohistochemistry (FISH-IHC) revealed robust D1Aa and D2a expression in forebrain auditory-recipient centers that receive catecholaminergic input: postcommissural and ventral nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, anterior tuberal nucleus, central posterior nucleus of the thalamus, and parvocellular preoptic nuclei. Large dopamine neurons in the periventricular posterior tuberculum, which are, in part, responsible for the reproductive-state changes in central and peripheral catecholamine innervation only express D2a, whereas large noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus express both D1Aa and D2a. The midbrain torus semicircularis, periaqueductal gray, hindbrain octavolateralis efferent nucleus, and descending/secondary octaval nuclei also express both receptor types. D2a expression predominates over D1Aa, and we identify a subpopulation of cells throughout the auditory system that co-express both receptors. The robust distribution of inhibitory and excitatory dopamine receptor expression in the central auditory system, coupled with co-expression in a subset of cells, provides strong neuroanatomical evidence of dopamines complex role in modulating auditory sensitivity and processing.",

      "title": "Elevated urea levels in human frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis post-mortem brain tissue: Evidence of a multi-dementia pathogenic mechanism",
      "content": "Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) represent two neurodegenerative diseases on opposite sides of a movement disorder continuum. However, like many other neurodegenerative diseases, the molecular pathogenesis of FTD and ALS is not fully understood. Our group has previously reported evidence for a pervasive elevation of brain urea levels in five other dementia-causing diseases. However, brain urea levels have yet to be measured in ALS and FTD. Here, we employed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to characterise brain urea differences between control (n=14/12) and ALS/FTD (FTD: n=8/9; ALS: n=13/14) cases in post-mortem tissue from two brain regions with different levels of neuropathological burden (high vs. low). Elevated urea levels were observed in both the frontal cortex (high neuropathological burden) and primary visual cortex (low neuropathological burden) in cases with FTD. Contrastingly, in cases with ALS, elevated urea was observed in the primary motor cortex (high neuropathological burden), but not the dentate nucleus (low neuropathological burden). These results not only suggest that elevated urea levels are also present in ALS and FTD but imply that elevated brain urea is linked to a multi-dementia pathogenic mechanism. In contrast to ALS, the observation of elevated urea in regions of both high and low neuropathological burden in FTD implies that this phenotype is likely widespread and, therefore, may play a larger role in the pathogenesis of disease. Such a mechanism could offer new directions for developing treatments targeting this underlying pathology.",

      "content": "Traveling waves are neural oscillations that progressively propagate across the cortex in specific directions and spatial patterns, however, their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. To probe their mechanisms, we analyzed direct brain recordings from humans performing a working memory task using empirical statistical modeling and computational modeling. By using independent component analysis, we showed that traveling waves propagated along the cortex in complex spatial patterns that correlated with behaviors such as memory encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. We also applied a novel computational model to identify novel complex spatial patterns, using coupled phase oscillators to reveal hidden spirals that were not clearly visible in the original recordings. The orientation of these hidden spirals distinguished between separate cognitive states, such as memory encoding and retrieval. Our simultaneous empirical and computational modeling provides a general framework to probe the functional significance and neurocomputational mechanisms underlying a diverse range of spatial patterns of traveling waves. Importantly, our novel model-based analytical approach can identify new types of traveling waves in the brain that are missed with conventional analysis approaches.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
