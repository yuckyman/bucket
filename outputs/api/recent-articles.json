      "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
      "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",

      "title": "End-to-end robot intelligent obstacle avoidance method based on deep reinforcement learning with spatiotemporal transformer architecture",
      "content": "To enhance the obstacle avoidance performance and autonomous decision-making capabilities of robots in complex dynamic environments, this paper proposes an end-to-end intelligent obstacle avoidance method that integrates deep reinforcement learning, spatiotemporal attention mechanisms, and a Transformer-based architecture. Current mainstream robot obstacle avoidance methods often rely on system architectures with separated perception and decision-making modules, which suffer from issues such as fragmented feature transmission, insufficient environmental modeling, and weak policy generalization. To address these problems, this paper adopts Deep Q-Network (DQN) as the core of reinforcement learning, guiding the robot to autonomously learn optimal obstacle avoidance strategies through interaction with the environment, effectively handling continuous decision-making problems in dynamic and uncertain scenarios. To overcome the limitations of traditional perception mechanisms in modeling the temporal evolution of obstacles, a spatiotemporal attention mechanism is introduced, jointly modeling spatial positional relationships and historical motion trajectories to enhance the model's perception of critical obstacle areas and potential collision risks. Furthermore, an end-to-end Transformer-based perception-decision architecture is designed, utilizing multi-head self-attention to perform high-dimensional feature modeling on multi-modal input information (such as LiDAR and depth images), and generating action policies through a decoding module. This completely eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and intermediate state modeling, constructing an integrated learning process of perception and decision-making. Experiments conducted in several typical obstacle avoidance simulation environments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream deep reinforcement learning approaches in terms of obstacle avoidance success rate, path optimization, and policy convergence speed. It exhibits good stability and generalization capabilities, showing broad application prospects for deployment in real-world complex environments.",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "content": "Under the influence of Masked Language Modeling (MLM), Masked Image Modeling (MIM) employs an attention mechanism to perform masked training on images. However, processing a single image requires numerous iterations and substantial computational resources to reconstruct the masked regions, resulting in high computational complexity and significant time costs. To address this issue, we propose an Effective and Efficient self-supervised Masked model based on Mixed feature training (EESMM). First, we stack two images for encoding and input the fused features into the network, which not only reduces computational complexity but also enables the learning of more features. Second, during decoding, we obtain the decoding features corresponding to the original images based on the decoding features of the two input original images and the mixed images, and then construct a corresponding loss function to enhance feature representation. EESMM significantly reduces pre-training time without sacrificing accuracy, achieving 83% accuracy on ImageNet in just 363 h using four V100 GPUs\u2013only one-tenth of the training time required by SimMIM. This validates that the method can substantially accelerate the pre-training process without noticeable performance degradation.",

I set out to create a Rust layer using PyO3 to accelerate the performance-critical parts: token counting, routing, rate limiting, and connection pooling.<p>The Approach<p>- Built Rust implementations for token counting using tiktoken-rs<p>- Added lock-free data structures with DashMap for concurrent operations<p>- Implemented async-friendly rate limiting<p>- Created monkeypatch shims to replace Python functions transparently<p>- Added comprehensive feature flags for safe, gradual rollouts<p>- Developed performance monitoring to track improvements in real-time<p>After building out all the Rust acceleration, I ran my comprehensive benchmark comparing baseline LiteLLM vs. the shimmed version:<p>Function             Baseline Time   Shimmed Time    Speedup    Improvement  Status<p>token_counter        0.000035s     0.000036s     0.99x          -0.6%<p>count_tokens_batch   0.000001s     0.000001s     1.10x          +9.1%<p>router               0.001309s     0.001299s     1.01x          +0.7%<p>rate_limiter         0.000000s     0.000000s     1.85x         +45.9%<p>connection_pool      0.000000s     0.000000s     1.63x         +38.7%<p>Turns out LiteLLM is already quite well-optimized! The core token counting was essentially unchanged (0.6% slower, likely within measurement noise), and the most significant gains came from the more complex operations like rate limiting and connection pooling where Rust's concurrent primitives made a real difference.<p>Key Takeaways<p>1. Don't assume existing libraries are under-optimized - The maintainers likely know their domain well\n2. Focus on algorithmic improvements over reimplementation - Sometimes a better approach beats a faster language\n3. Micro-benchmarks can be misleading - Real-world performance impact varies significantly\n4. The most gains often come from the complex parts, not the simple operations\n5. Even \"modest\" improvements can matter at scale - 45% improvements in rate limiting are meaningful for high-throughput applications<p>While the core token counting saw minimal improvement, the rate limiting and connection pooling gains still provide value for high-volume use cases. The infrastructure I built (feature flags, performance monitoring, safe fallbacks) creates a solid foundation for future optimizations.<p>The project continues as Fast LiteLLM on GitHub for anyone interested in the Rust-Python integration patterns, even if the performance gains were humbling.<p>Edit: To clarify - the negative performance for token_counter is likely in the noise range of measurement, suggesting that LiteLLM's token counting is already well-optimized. The 45%+ gains in rate limiting and connection pooling still provide value for high-throughput applications.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45968461\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45968461</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "A growing body of literature describes the anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-epileptic properties of the cannabis sativa constituent cannabidiol, suggesting that it might play a useful role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN2 disease) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder resulting from an inherited dysfunction of the lysosome. CLN2 disease, and its representative animal models, display neuroimmune response, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and epileptic seizures, and these symptoms are all touted as potential targets of cannabidiol therapeutic benefit. Here, we treated a valid model of CLN2 disease with long-term daily cannabidiol (300mg/kg) from 1 month of age until disease end stage and evaluated epileptic seizures, lifespan, and markers of neuroimmune response. Chronic cannabidiol treatment significantly delayed or fully eliminated seizures in CLN2 mice compared to those treated with vehicle only, and the treatment led to a nearly significant extension of lifespan. These effects occurred in the absence of any therapeutic benefit to physiological markers of disease such as GFAP, CD68, and cytokine/chemokine reactivity. Taken together, we show that chronic treatment with cannabidiol confers significant anti-seizure benefit to the mouse model of CLN2 disease, and that it does not appear to do so by altering the inflammatory and neuroimmune markers traditionally used to track CLN2 disease progression.",

      "content": "Sequestosome 1/p62 (hereafter referred to as p62) is a multifunctional protein that orchestrates various cellular stress response pathways including autophagy, proteasome-mediated degradation, antioxidant defense, nutrient sensing, and inflammatory signaling. Mutations in distinct functional domains of p62 are linked with the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), underscoring its importance in neural cells. Neurons and astrocytes perform distinct roles in brain physiology and thus encounter a unique landscape of cellular stress. However, how p62 is regulated in these cell types in response to various stress modalities remains largely unexplored. Several functions for p62 depend on engagement with ubiquitinated substrates. Thus, we investigated how the regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates differs between neurons and astrocytes exposed to two stress modalities: lysosomal membrane damage and metabolic stress. Lysosomal damage triggered ubiquitin-dependent assembly of p62 puncta in both neurons and astrocytes. In contrast, nutrient deprivation elicited different responses between neurons and astrocytes. Neurons formed p62-ubiquitin structures more prominently and displayed a greater dependence on ubiquitin for p62 clustering. Together, these findings reveal cell-type-specific and stress-specific regulation of p62-ubiquitin conjugates, indicating that neurons and astrocytes can deploy distinct quality control strategies.",

Identify changes in associated neural circuits. Methods: We tested METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male and female 129Sv/Ev and C57Bl/6 mice during middle adolescence using 1mg/kg of METH. Behaviorally-induced upregulation of c-Fos protein expression was quantified in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and area CA1 of the hippocampus following the post-conditioning test. Results: In C57Bl/6 mice, METH induced CPP in females, but not males. Conversely, METH-induced CPP in 129Sv/Ev males, but not females. In both strains, groups that exhibited CPP had more c-Fos+ cells in the NAc and CA1 when compared to saline-treated control groups. The number of c-Fos+ cells in these two brain regions correlated in groups exhibiting CPP, indicating increased NAc-CA1 communication during retrieval of the conditioned memory. Finally, we found evidence of behavioral sensitization in 129Sv/Ev males only. Conclusions: Our study reveals that the rewarding effects of the METH in adolescent mice are both sex- and strain-dependent, indicating that METH response may result from an interaction between sex-specific and genetic mechanisms. Our findings will be informative when selecting an appropriate background strain in future studies using genetically modified mice.",

      "title": "Opposite and complementary roles of the two calcium thresholds for inducing LTP and LTD in models of striatal projection neurons",
      "content": "Synaptic plasticity has been shown to occur when calcium, flowing into the synapse due to incoming stimuli, surpasses a threshold level. This threshold level is modifiable through a process called metaplasticity. Some neurons, such as the striatal projection neurons, use different sources of calcium as the signal for synaptic strengthening (long-term potentiation, LTP) or weakening (long-term depression, LTD), resulting in them having two thresholds for inducing plasticity. In this study, we show opposite and complementary roles of metaplasticity in these two thresholds for inducing LTP and LTD on learning how to solve the linear and nonlinear feature binding problem (FBP and NFBP). In short, metaplasticity in one threshold (e.g. LTD) allows synaptic plasticity of the opposite type (e.g. LTP) to be properly expressed. This happens because metaplasticity in the LTD threshold protects strengthened synapses from weakening, thus allowing them to persistently increase during learning (and encode learned patterns). Similarly, metaplasticity in the LTP threhsold prevents weakened synapses from strengthening, thus allowing them to persistently decrease. Metaplasticity in both thresholds is necessary when synapses are clustered and the neuron needs to rely on supralinear dendritic integration for learning.",
