      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "Multiscale intracranial EEG dynamics across sleep\u2013wake states: toward memory-related processing",
      "content": "Sleep is known to support memory consolidation through a complex interplay of neural dynamics across multiple timescales. Using intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings from patients undergoing clinical monitoring, we characterize spectral activity, neuronal avalanche dynamics, and temporal correlations across sleep-wake states, with a focus on their spatial distribution and potential functional relevance. We observe increased low-frequency power, larger avalanches, and enhanced long-range temporal correlations\u2014quantified via Detrended Fluctuation Analysis\u2014during N2 and N3 sleep. In contrast, REM sleep and wakefulness show reduced temporal persistence and fewer large-scale cascades, suggesting a shift toward more fragmented and flexible dynamics. These signatures vary across cortical regions, with distinctive patterns emerging in medial temporal and frontal areas\u2014regions implicated in memory processing. Rather than providing direct evidence of consolidation, our results point to a functional neural landscape that may favor both stabilization and reconfiguration of internal representations during sleep. Overall, our findings highlight the utility of iEEG in revealing the multiscale spatio-temporal structure of sleep-related brain dynamics, offering insights into the physiological conditions that support memory-related processing.",

      "title": "Targeting the parietal memory network with tDCS in MCI: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",
      "content": "BackgroundMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage in dementia related disorders. In that context, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) are subjected to neuropathological changes in MCI. Furthermore, alterations in parietal memory network (PMN) integrity and default mode network (DMN) also occur in MCI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising neuroprotective tool that might interfere with cognitive decline in Alzheimer\u2019s disease-MCI (aMCI) and Parkinson\u2019s disease-MCI (PD-MCI) when applied to DLPFC or LPC separately.MethodsThis is a randomized and controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of tDCS in 120 patients (60 aMCI and 60 PD-MCI). Firstly, all patients will be randomly (1:1) divided into two groups: DLPFC (30 aMCI; 30 PD-MCI) and LPC (30 aMCI, 30 PD-MCI) for tDCS stimulation. Secondly, they will classify randomly (2:1) real and sham groups for tDCS applied to once a day for 10 days over 2 weeks. The stimulation will be delivered with a 2-mA current frequency and will last 20\u202fmin. The primary outcome assessment for this study will be the change in score from baseline to the end of (14-days and 90\u202fdays follow-up) the tDCS application for the neurocognitive tests. Potential outcome parameters will be discussed in the light of current literature to contribute to the new area of personalized non-invasive brain stimulation research in neurodegenerative diseases at early stages. The results of this study are expected to shed light on the neural underpinnings and pro-cognitive outcomes of tDCS. Potential outcome parameters will be discussed in the light of current literature to contribute to the new area of personalized non-invasive brain stimulation research in neurodegenerative diseases at early stages.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe coordination and expression of cultural specific affective cues during speech production in a second language (L2) reflects pragmatic adaptation, which is a critical step toward learning and achieving broader pragmatic competence. Embodied cognition provides a framework for understanding how cognitive and emotional processes shape L2 expression.ObjectiveThis study examined how immersive language experience influences pragmatic adaptation through the vocal expression of affect and physiological arousal in Chinese ESL learners.MethodsAcoustic analysis and electrodermal activity (EDA) measurements were used to assess affectively valenced word production in speakers with varying levels of immersive English experience.ResultsHigh-immersion speakers exhibited greater pitch, intensity, and duration variation, enhancing emotional expressivity. Low-immersion speakers showed constrained vocal patterns and significantly higher physiological arousal, likely due to increased cognitive demands and anxiety.DiscussionThese findings highlight the impact of L2 proficiency on affective language embodiment and the cognitive challenges faced by L2 learners. This study offers novel insights by considering a pictorial character-based language, broadening our understanding of emotion-language interaction. Findings have implications for second-language education, cross-cultural communication, and bilingual speech therapy.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of uncertainty processing: meta-analysis of fMRI studies",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making under uncertainty represents a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the consistent neural correlates of uncertainty processing specifically during decision-making tasks.MethodsWe synthesized findings from 76 fMRI studies (N = 4,186 participants). Using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) method, we performed a voxel-wise meta-analysis of activation foci to identify brain regions consistently activated across studies.ResultsThe analysis revealed nine distinct activation clusters, revealing a comprehensive neural network involved in uncertainty processing. Key findings demonstrated predominant activations in the anterior insula (up to 63.7% representation), inferior frontal gyrus (up to 40.7%), and inferior parietal lobule (up to 78.1%). We found a functional specialization between emotional-motivational processes (clusters 1\u20135) and cognitive processes (clusters 6\u20139), with notable hemispheric asymmetries. The left anterior insula was more strongly associated with reward evaluation, while the right was involved in learning and cognitive control. Similarly, the right inferior frontal gyrus was linked to impulse control, and the left to motor planning.DiscussionOur findings extend the current understanding of the neural architecture of decision-making under uncertainty. The comprehensive mapping of neural signatures advances our knowledge of the distinct roles of key brain regions and provides insights into potential clinical applications, particularly for developing interventions for uncertainty-related anxiety. The study highlights important directions for future research in cognitive neuroscience and clinical practice.",

      "title": "Inter-brain synchrony between undergraduate students during a naturalistic online seminar predicted greater relational satisfaction and task performance",
      "content": "As higher education increasingly transitions to online platforms such as Zoom, understanding the mechanisms that underlie effective virtual collaboration has become essential. Prior research has shown that relational quality, trust, and communication strongly influence online collaborative learning; however, the real-time cognitive and affective dynamics underpinning these interactions are yet to be elucidated. This study addresses this gap by examining inter-brain synchrony (IBS)\u2014the alignment of neural activity between individuals\u2014as an indicator of collaborative success. Using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning, we investigated IBS in 30 dyads of undergraduate students engaged in a naturalistic three-phase Zoom seminar comprising lecture viewing, interactive discussion, and a presentation. Inter-brain synchrony between partners was computed in the prefrontal cortex, and outcomes were assessed via relational satisfaction questionnaires and standardized ratings of presentations. Results showed that IBS emerged predominantly during active discussions, but not during passive lecture viewing, underscoring the importance of interactive engagement in generating neural alignment. Crucially, higher IBS during discussion predicted both greater group relational satisfaction and improved task performance. These findings extend prior evidence that IBS supports cooperation, demonstrating that neural synchrony can occur even without physical co-presence and is associated with both performance and satisfaction in virtual educational settings.",

      "title": "Ferroptosis in ischemic stroke: mechanisms, pathological implications, and therapeutic strategies",
      "content": "Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a pivotal mechanism in the complex pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, a leading cause of global death and disability. This review synthesizes current understanding of the core ferroptosis pathways, including iron dysregulation, glutathione depletion, and GPX4 inactivation and distinguishes it from other cell death modalities. We critically explore its role as a pathogenic amplifier in stroke, synergizing with neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction to expand neuronal injury. The review systematically assesses therapeutic strategies, from iron chelators and lipid peroxidation inhibitors (e.g., ferrostatin-1) to emerging gene therapies and nanomedicine-based approaches, based on robust preclinical evidence. However, translating these findings faces challenges, including a narrow therapeutic window, patient heterogeneity, and the need to balance efficacy with safety concerning systemic iron and lipid metabolism. To overcome these translational challenges, future research must prioritize the discovery of clinical biomarkers (e.g., FABP5) and the development of targeted delivery systems to advance ferroptosis-directed therapies for stroke.",
