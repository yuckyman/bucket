      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
      "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "CONCLUSIONS: Optimal visual resolution during MS lens wear is achieved when fixating through the clear, central area of the lens. Under these circumstances, objects at 20-50 degrees from fixation are seen through the lenslet-covered region of the carrier which produces a low-pass spatial frequency filtering effect. Here, visual resolution is limited to a few cycles per degree so that any growth control mechanism must rely on low spatial frequency information.",

However, endoscopic and dermoscopic images often exhibit blurred boundaries and low contrast, presenting a significant challenge for precise segmentation. Moreover, single encoder-decoder architectures suffer from inherent limitations, resulting in the loss of either fine-grained details or global context. Some dual-encoder models yield inaccurate results due to mismatched receptive fields and...",
