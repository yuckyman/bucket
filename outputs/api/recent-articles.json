      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

      "content": "IntroductionDeep brain stimulation (DBS) has been demonstrated to improve motor function by modulating brain circuits. However, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Existing DBS devices often lack suitability for rodent models, which are essential for exploring these mechanisms. The objective of this study is to design a wearable DBS device that enables more effective rodent behavior research.MethodsWe developed a stimulator specifically designed for rodent behavioral research. The device features several key advantages, including low weight (5 g excluding battery), compact size (30 mm \u00d7 38 mm), and extended battery life (\u2265300 hours). Additionally, it integrates low-power Bluetooth, allowing for real-time wireless adjustment of stimulation parameters, such as frequency (80\u2013150 Hz), pulse width (40\u2013340 \u03bcs), and amplitude (2.3\u20133 V).ResultsThe stimulating effect of this device has been verified in a model of mild Parkinson\u2019s disease (mild Parkinsonism) in rats, indicating that the device is effective in regulating the motor functions of rodents with Parkinson\u2019s disease-like conditions.DiscussionThis wearable DBS device shows broad applicability in behavior-based studies and offers a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms of various brain nuclei in rodent models. It holds significant potential for enhancing the exploration of DBS effects in clinical and experimental settings.",

      "title": "An algorithmic procedure for measuring deep brain stimulation-induced capsular activation using motor evoked potentials",
      "content": "Objective. Effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease requires careful surgical targeting and adjustment of stimulation parameters to avoid motor side effects caused by activation of the internal capsule. Currently, patients must self-report side effects during implantation surgery and device programming\u2014a subjective and inconsistent process that may delay optimized treatment or result in suboptimal therapy. Motor evoked potentials (mEP), the use of electromyography to record DBS-induced muscle activation, offer a promising biomarker for objective motor side effect detection. Approach. We present an automated algorithmic procedure for mEP detection and quantification. Main results. First, we design and evaluate a series of signal processing techniques to accurately detect mEP while mitigating the influence of stimulation artifacts and noise, then demonstrate a strategy for integrating multi-channel EMG responses into a single side effect biomarker (the mEP score). Next, we use data from a large patient cohort of intraoperative recordings (N = 54 subthalamic nucleus (STN) leads) to quantify several physiological features of mEP, including their response frequency, latency, amplitude, and waveform similarity properties. Last, we show that the mEP score responds to DBS amplitude and contact configuration parameters in a manner that is consistent with expected STN-capsular anatomy. Significance. The results of this study inform an end-to-end approach for side effect biomarker measurement that could aid the precision and efficiency of surgical targeting and DBS programming.",

      "content": "Objective. This study assesses the signal quality of state-of-the-art dry electroencephalography (EEG) under highly challenging, uncontrolled, real-world conditions and compares it to conventional wet EEG. Approach. EEG data from 530 participants recorded during a public exhibition were benchmarked against several established signal quality metrics, including spiking activity, kurtosis, auto-mutual information, spectral entropy, gamma-band power, and parameters extracted using the fitting oscillations and one-over F model. Additionally, ICLabel decomposition was applied to quantify artifact influences across EEG channels. Dry electrode results were compared with their equivalents extracted on two control datasets comprising 71 and 80 participants, respectively, recorded with wet EEG systems in laboratory, home, or clinical surroundings. Main results. The analysis revealed condition-specific susceptibility to artifacts for both EEG modalities. The dry EEG system exhibited substantial robustness in moderate-noise scenarios, with artifact profiles comparable to controlled wet EEG recordings. However, recordings obtained in highly dynamic conditions showed increased muscle artifacts and broadband activity, notably in frontal and temporal regions. Wet EEG systems, under controlled conditions, were overall less inflicted by artifacts, yet, fronto-central ocular and muscular artifacts were consistently present. ICLabel analysis further confirmed these findings, indicating similar proportions of brain-related activity across systems (approximately 31%\u201349.5%), but highlighted increased vulnerability to movement and environmental artifacts in dry EEG during dynamic tasks. Significance. In agreement with recent similar investigations, our findings demonstrate that dry EEG caps have significantly matured, achieving signal quality comparable to wet EEG systems even in challenging real-world conditions, provided appropriate artifact mitigation strategies are employed. These results affirm the practical readiness and broad feasibility of dry EEG technologies for diverse Brain\u2013computer interface applications in naturalistic environments.",

      "title": "Temporal properties of direct current sensory block of the rat sciatic nerve using the C-fiber reflex",
      "content": "Objective. Direct current (DC) electrical block of peripheral sensory axons has potential for clinical applications in pain management. The C-fiber reflex (CFR), elicited via noxious stimulation of the foot, is suitable for investigating the activation of unmyelinated C-fiber nerves, the fiber class that is responsible for lingering pain sensations. Approach. In anesthetized rats, the CFR was elicited via electrical stimulation to the plantar surface of the hindpaw, and the resulting C-fiber-evoked electromyography (EMG) signals were recorded from the ipsilateral biceps femoris muscle. A carbon separated interface nerve electrode was used to deliver DC block to arrest action potentials in the sciatic nerve. The efficacy of the block was observed as a reduction/abolition of the magnitude of the EMG in a time window corresponding to the latency of C-fibers activity. Main results. Complete cessation of nerve activity could be achieved instantaneously by applying DC at the \u2018block threshold (BT)\u2019. At amplitudes below the BT, complete block could be induced over a period of seconds to minutes, with lower currents being correlated with longer induction times. When block was applied for prolonged periods of time, block was sustained following the cessation of DC delivery. This \u2018recovery period\u2019 was longer for longer durations of block application. Significance. The CFR is an established method to investigate pharmaceutical pain therapies, yet to date, has not been used to assess electrical block of sensory axons. Therefore, anatomical and electrophysiological methods were used to validate this method. DC nerve block shows promise for clinical pain management applications. Furthermore, the temporal properties described here could be used to reduce overall electrical current delivery and improve safety.",

      "title": "Comparison of multidomain assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion.",
      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

      "title": "Neural correlates of stigma: A systematic review.",
      "content": "Objective: Understanding neural mechanisms underlying the experience and enactment of stigma is needed to address the public health challenge posed by both experienced and enacted stigma. In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on neural correlates of stigma from the perspective of (a) the stigmatizer (enacted stigma) and (b) the stigmatized (experienced stigma). Method: We searched PsychInfo, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, and SCOPUS for articles assessing stigma using neuroimaging. Results: Thirty-one articles were included covering a variety of stigmatized identities (i.e., mental health, medical conditions, homelessness), with 20 articles on enacted stigma and 11 on experienced stigma. There was a large variety in methodological approaches, including varying experimental paradigms, analytical approaches (e.g., whole-brain vs. region-of-interest analyses), samples, and degree to which stigma is assessed and/or verified (as opposed to assumed to be present in response to exclusion or in response to specific stimuli). Regardless, our review indicates that a widespread network of brain regions is implicated in the enactment of stigma (in the stigmatizer), including frontal, cingulate, parietal, occipital, and subcortical regions, which are characterized by inconsistencies that likely result from methodological differences. In contrast, a blunted medial prefrontal cortex response to experienced stigma is relatively consistently observed (in the stigmatized). Conclusions: Our review is the first to comprehensively synthesize studies examining neural correlates of stigma, revealing tangible brain patterns reflecting its experience and enactment, enhancing our understanding of stigma and its assessment. Last, we highlight the complexity of this research area and discuss insights and considerations for future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Sigma receptors and mitochondria-associated ER membranes are converging therapeutic targets for Alzheimer\u2019s disease",
      "content": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) begins decades before clinical symptoms emerge. The \u201camyloid hypothesis\u201d suggests that amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) deposition initiates a cascade of tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline. The recent success of anti-A\u03b2 therapies such as Leqembi in prodromal or mild cognitive impaired patients underscores the importance of early intervention and A\u03b2 clearance. However, safety and cost limitations highlight the need for alternative therapeutic strategies. Small-molecule modulators of Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptors (\u03c31R and \u03c32R) have emerged as promising candidates for AD treatment. \u03c31R agonists exhibit neuroprotective and anti-amnestic effects under pathological conditions without affecting normal cognition. Beyond AD, \u03c31R is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), Parkinson\u2019s, and Huntington\u2019s diseases, stroke, and epilepsy. \u03c31R plays a key role at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs)\u2014specialized lipid raft-like domains that form functional membrane contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. \u03b2-secretase (BACE1), \u03b3-secretase, and their substrates APP and palmitoylated APP (palAPP) localize in the MAMs, promoting amyloidogenic A\u03b2 production. MAMs serve as dynamic hubs for inter-organelle communication, calcium signaling, and lipid metabolism. The \u201cMAM hypothesis\u201d proposes that MAM dysregulation drives early AD pathology and persists throughout disease progression, contributing to neurofibrillary tangle formation, calcium imbalance, and neuroinflammation. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of \u03c31R-mediated regulation of MAMs and its neuroprotective mechanisms, highlighting potential therapeutic opportunities for targeting \u03c31R in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "content": "Objective. Speech imagery recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is an emerging challenge in brain-computer interfaces, and has important applications, such as in the interaction with locked-in patients. In this work, we use graph signal processing for developing a more effective representation of EEG signals in speech imagery recognition. Approach. We propose a dynamic graph representation that uses multiple graphs constructed based on the time-varying correlations between EEG channels. Our methodology is particularly suitable for signals that exhibit fluctuating correlations, which cannot be adequately modeled through a static (single graph) model. The resultant representation provides graph frequency features that compactly capture the spatial patterns of the underlying multidimensional EEG signal as well as the evolution of spatial relationships over time. These dynamic graph features are fed into an attention-based long short-term memory network for speech imagery recognition. A novel EEG data augmentation method is also proposed for improving training robustness. Main results. Experimental evaluation using a range of experiments shows that the proposed dynamic graph features are more effective than conventional time-frequency features for speech imagery recognition. The overall system outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, yielding accuracy gains of up to 10%. Significance. The dynamic graph representation captures time-varying spatial relationships in EEG signals, overcoming limitations of static graph models and conventional feature extraction. Combined with data augmentation and attention-based classification, it demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in speech imagery recognition.",

Advances in implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCI) have rapidly accelerated in the last decade that promises to improve the quality of life of patients with communications, sensory, and motor control disabilities. Approach. In this Perspective, we quantify the extent and nature of scientific convergence across 21 research groups conducting iBCI clinical trials worldwide. Using medical subject headers and Classification of Instructional Programs taxonomies, we analyze topical and disciplinary integration within 161 publications from 1998\u20132023 to assess how deeply team composition aligns with research themes and translational impact. Main Results. Our findings indicate uneven patterns of convergence, with many teams combining engineering and clinical expertise yet omitting ethical, legal, and social dimensions. This represents what we term short-cut convergence. Significance. We propose an operational definition of this phenomenon and identify practical steps for researchers and funders to strengthen full convergence to accelerate iBCI translation and implementation.",

      "title": "Electrical characterization and accelerated aging of amorphous silicon carbide implantable encapsulation",
      "content": "Objective. Chronically implanted microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are used for stimulating and recording neural activity in research and clinical settings. However, their reliability can be compromised by insufficient encapsulation stability. Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC), a chemically stable and biocompatible material, has emerged as a potential thin-film encapsulation for MEAs. We aimed to evaluate thin-film a-SiC encapsulation using electrical-accelerated aging (EAA) and to demonstrate a methodology for obtaining acceleration factors for EAA by Weibull analysis. Approach. Interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) encapsulated with a-SiC were subjected to voltage cycling and stepped-voltage protocols to measure leakage currents in buffered saline at 37 \u00b0C. EAA employed incrementally increasing voltage biases over time to induce degradation and reveal failure mechanisms. Main results. IDEs exhibited a significant change in electrical behavior on exposure to saline, with failure initiating at specific voltages and accompanied by gas evolution at defect sites. Incremental voltage biasing revealed a capacitive-to-faradaic transition in leakage current response that was used as a failure criterion. Significance. Acceleration factors for voltage-driven accelerated aging of a-SiC thin-film encapsulation can be obtained by Weibull analysis using a mechanistic failure criterion. Breakdown occurs at processing-related defects in the a-SiC. This study demonstrates the use of EAA for evaluating failure in a-SiC thin-film encapsulation used in implantable MEAs. EAA is broadly applicable to thin-film MEAs and provides a highly relevant method of predicting implanted lifetimes of bioelectronics.",
