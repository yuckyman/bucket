      "title": "A shared ensemble in the prelimbic cortex links impulsivity and anxiety-like behavior.",
      "content": "Mental health disorders often share overlapping behavioral and neural features, yet it remains unclear why these relationships emerge or whether they reflect common underlying neural processes. To explore this, we recorded prelimbic (PL) activity using endoscopic calcium imaging as rats completed a battery of tasks assessing impulsivity, distress tolerance, anxiety-like behavior, incentive salience (Pavlovian conditioned approach), and sensation-seeking in a novel environment (locomotor activity). By collecting neural and behavioral measures across all tasks within each animal, we were able to investigate whether PL activity tracked processes that were either unique to individual behaviors, shared across multiple behaviors, or both. We found that PL activity was significantly predictive of each of the behaviors except locomotor activity. Subsequent analyses revealed shared behavioral structure across tasks, with one latent dimension reflecting high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. Individual variability across this particular dimension was strongly predicted by a neural structure comprising shared PL activity across four of the behaviors. Furthermore, this relationship was driven by a subset of PL neurons that shared patterns of activity across multiple tasks, forming a shared neural ensemble. Importantly, animals with a greater tendency to share neural ensembles exhibited a stronger link between high impulsivity and low anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest that a small, shared ensemble of PL neurons tracked activity across multiple clinically-relevant behaviors to predict an approach/avoidance phenotype characterized by high impulsivity and low anxiety. This points toward a targetable neural population that may help explain why diverse psychiatric symptoms often co-occur within individuals.",

It provides three interfaces:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Web Interface</strong> \u2013 An interactive map-based UI (<code>niceGUI</code>) to visually search and filter satellite products by location, date range, and cloud cover. <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto/blob/main/docs/assets/vresto_demo.gif\">Demo here</a></li> <li><strong>Python API</strong> \u2013 Clean, programmatic access for automation and batch processing</li> <li><strong>CLI</strong> \u2013 Command-line tools for quick searches and downloads</li> </ol> <p>Key capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>Search satellite products by name or geographic location</li> <li>Download individual spectral bands (RGB, infrared, etc.) for analysis and artifact detection</li> <li>Access metadata and quicklook previews</li> <li>Inspect and visualize Sentinel-2 L1C and L2A imagery (with support for more coming later)</li> <li>Handle S3 authentication securely</li> </ul> <h1>Why I built this</h1> <p>This came from a real need when exploring and cleaning large satellite datasets for ML model training: researchers and developers need a fast, intuitive way to find <strong>individual</strong> products, inspect their bands for quality issues, and download specific data\u2014without context-switching between multiple tools and programming languages.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <ul> <li><strong>ML/AI researchers</strong> \u2013 Building datasets from satellite imagery and need to explore/clean individual products</li> <li><strong>Geospatial researchers &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Analyzing multispectral imagery for environmental monitoring, agriculture, or climate research</li> <li><strong>GIS developers &amp; engineers</strong> \u2013 Building Python applications that need streamlined satellite data discovery and access</li> <li><strong>Data analysts &amp; scientists</strong> \u2013 Working with remote sensing data for analysis and visualization</li> <li><strong>Hobbyists &amp; enthusiasts</strong> \u2013 Anyone curious about satellite data and earth observation</li> </ul> <h1>Comparison</h1> <p>The most popular alternatives to searching Satellite products with Python (and offering a CLI) are <a href=\"https://github.com/CS-SI/eodag\">eodag</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/CDSETool/CDSETool\">CDSETool</a>. The former seems to be a quite mature project with a complete suite that goes beyond the scope of &quot;single products&quot;, while the latter focuses more on product downloads. Neither offers an intuitive web interface like that of vresto. However, an integration with <code>eodag</code> could be interesting in the future to combine the best of both worlds.</p> <h1>How It Works</h1> <p><code>vresto</code> is built on top of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem catalog, providing an intuitive Python-first interface for the most common tasks: finding individual products, examining their metadata and spectral bands, and downloading what you need. Whether you prefer clicking on a map, writing a few lines of Python, or using the CLI, <code>vresto</code> keeps you focused on the data rather than the infrastructure.</p> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udd17 <strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/kalfasyan/vresto\">github.com/kalfasyan/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udcd6 <strong>Documentation:</strong> <a href=\"https://kalfasyan.github.io/vresto\">kalfasyan.github.io/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udce6 <strong>PyPI:</strong> <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/vresto/\">pypi.org/project/vresto</a></li> <li>\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f <strong>Data Source:</strong> <a href=\"https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/\">Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Note:</strong> Free Copernicus account required (get one at dataspace.copernicus.eu).

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",

      "title": "Breath as an internal context: Respiratory phase alignment between encoding and retrieval optimizes memory performance.",
      "content": "Increasing evidence suggests that respiratory rhythms are crucial for cognitive functions. Although recent findings suggest that respiratory activity may serve as an internal contextual framework during memory processes, the contribution of specific respiratory phases to encoding and retrieval remains unclear. Here, we investigated the breathing-dependent performance of 30 healthy volunteers during a visual delayed matching-to-sample recognition memory task while their nasal respiration was monitored. Reaction times (RTs) decreased when visual cues were both encoded and retrieved during the late phase of exhalation. In contrast, longer RTs were observed during late exhalation at retrieval when encoding occurred either (i) during a period that encompassed inspiratory onset (i.e., exhalation-to-inhalation transition or EI transition) or (ii) during the early phase of inhalation. These contrasting outcomes under identical retrieval conditions highlight the phase-dependent effects of respiration, specifically the alignment of respiratory timing between encoding and retrieval. Importantly, we found that the late phase of exhalation during both encoding and retrieval may represent a favorable temporal window for shaping memory performance. These findings suggest that respiratory phase alignment modulates memory processes by providing an interoceptive, phase-dependent context for cognition.",

      "title": "Capturing Rapid Behavioral Adaptation in an Updated Theory of the Hippocampal Cognitive Map and its Neural Implementation",
      "content": "Animals rapidly and flexibly adapt their behavior by forming an internal cognitive map. The cognitive map has been studied at multiple levels, including normative, representational, and mechanistic accounts, often focused on the role of the hippocampus. Here, we propose a framework extending the normative successor representation (SR) theory and its link to hippocampal representations and processes, incorporating recent insights into the neural basis of rapid adaptation in hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1. In our model, CA3 uses temporally symmetric behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP) to encode spatiotemporal proximity experienced during exploration, CA1 uses temporally asymmetric BTSP to encode a perceived salience-weighted SR, and downstream areas learn successor feature predictions that can guide behavior in accordance with a behaving animal's motivational state. Through simulations of a rodent exploring a maze, we show that the network rapidly learns this representation and further strengthens the map by generating spontaneous replay activity during subsequent offline phase. Behavioral simulations show how these processes give rise to motivational state-dependent choice, rapid behavioral adaptation to changes in the availability or reward, and one-trial avoidance learning.",
