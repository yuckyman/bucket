      "title": "Super-resolution microscopy and deep learning methods: what can they bring to neuroscience: from neuron to 3D spine segmentation",
      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "title": "Brain atrophy and cholinergic denervation in progressive supranuclear palsy: an MRI and [18F]-FEOBV PET study",
      "content": "IntroductionProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of motor and cognitive impairments. Structural brain imaging biomarkers, such as the Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index 2.0 (MRPI 2.0), are increasingly recognized as means of supporting a PSP diagnosis. These anatomic measures lack neurobiological correlates. In the present work, we investigated whether structural brain changes captured by MRPI 2.0 associate with whole-brain and regional cholinergic nerve terminal deficits in PSP.MethodsStructural magnetic resonance (MR) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) [18F]-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18F]-FEOBV) PET imaging was obtained in a sample of 16 PSP subjects. MRPI 2.0 index was quantified and correlated with whole brain VAChT binding using statistical parametric mapping (SPM), after adjustment for sex, dopaminergic medication dose and disease duration. Post hoc multiple regression analyses were performed to correlate regional mean VAChT binding with MRPI 2.0 (after adjusting for the same covariates), characterizing the proportion of variance in cholinergic terminal deficits explained by this structural index.ResultsVoxel-wise SPM analyses revealed that MRPI 2.0 is significantly associated with cholinergic nerve terminal loss in brainstem, especially pontomesencephalic, limbic structures, insula, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellar regions. Post hoc multiple regression analysis demonstrated that MRPI 2.0 accounts for about half of the variance in cholinergic nerve terminal integrity within relevant brain structures in PSP, showing the most robust association in the thalamus.DiscussionStructural brain changes associated with higher MRPI 2.0 index scores may be a reliable proxy measure of cholinergic terminal deficits in PSP, predominantly those in subcortical regions. Differential association of subcortical brain region cholinergic deficits with PSP-specific structural brain changes may reflect the characteristic pattern of 4R-tau pathology observed in PSP.",

      "content": "IntroductionHeart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have shown potential in diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. However, accurate classification of PCG signals remains challenging due to high dimensional features, leading to misclassification and reduced performance in conventional systems.MethodsTo address these challenges, we propose a Linear Vectored Particle Swarm Optimization (LV-PSO) integrated with a Fuzzy Inference Xception Convolutional Neural Network (XCNN) for early heart risk prediction. PC G signals are analyzed to extract variations such as delta, theta, diastolic, and systolic differences. A Support Scalar Cardiac Impact Rate (S2CIR) is employed to capture disease specific scalar variations and behavioral impacts. LV-PSO is used to reduce feature dimensionality, and the optimized features are subsequently trained using the Fuzzy Inference XCNN model to classify disease types.ResultsExperimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed system achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing models. The method attained a precision of 95.6%, recall of 93.1%, and an overall prediction accuracy of 95.8% across multiple disease categories.DiscussionThe integration of LV-PSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection aPSO with Fuzzy Inference XCNN enhances feature selection and nd classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-classification accuracy, significantly improving the diagnostic capabilities of PCG-based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a based systems. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework as a reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.reliable tool for early heart disease prediction and clinical decision support.",

      "content": "IntroductionNeural activity can be described in terms of probability distributions that are continuously evolving in time. Characterizing how these distributions are reshaped as they pass between cortical regions is key to understanding how information is organized in the brain.MethodsWe developed a mathematical framework that represents these transformations as information-theoretic gradient flows \u2014 dynamical trajectories that follow the steepest ascent of entropy and expectation. The relative strengths of these two functionals provide interpretable measures of how neural probability distributions change as they propagate within neural systems. Following construct validation in silico, we applied the framework to publicly available continuous \u0394F/F two-photon calcium recordings from the mouse visual cortex.ResultsThe analysis revealed consistent bi-directional transformations between the rostrolateral area and the primary visual cortex across all five mice. These findings demonstrate that the relative contributions of entropy and expectation can be disambiguated and used to describe information flow within cortical networks.DiscussionWe introduce a framework for decomposing neural signal transformations into interpretable information-theoretic components. Beyond the mouse visual cortex, the method can be applied to diverse neuroimaging modalities and scales, thereby providing a generalizable approach for quantifying how information geometry shapes cortical communication.",
