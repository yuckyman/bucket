      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "A computational framework combining neuronal dynamics and evolutionary game theory for network-level synaptic interactions",
      "content": "Objective. In this study, we present a novel computational framework that combines the Hindmarsh\u2013Rose (HR) neuronal model with evolutionary game theory on networks to simulate and interpret synaptic-level interactions within neuronal populations. Our approach preserves the features of the HR model\u2014capable of generating both spiking and bursting dynamics\u2014while integrating game-theoretic principles that govern the balance between emulative and non-emulative behaviors across neurons. Approach. Neurons were modeled as strategic agents whose interactions evolve according to game-theoretic principles, allowing us to capture emergent network dynamics beyond classical electrophysiological analyses. A key innovation of our work is the formulation of a parameter estimation method based on adaptive observers, which enables the recovery of game-theoretic parameters solely from partial state observations. The proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to recover hidden parameters and accurately predict system behavior under diverse conditions. Main results. By applying the devised approach to synthetic datasets mimicking real electrophysiological recordings, we highlight its applicability in distinguishing neuronal populations based on their strategic interactions. In this context, the model is shown to faithfully reproduce both spiking and bursting behaviors, capturing the diverse electrophysiological patterns observed in in vitro experimental settings. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this model in experimental data analysis by suggesting that the estimated parameters may serve as discriminative markers for different neuronal types and structural characteristics. Significance. The integration of dynamical systems theory, game-theoretic modeling, and adaptive estimation provides a robust quantitative tool for investigating complex neuronal network dynamics. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of the method in parameter estimation, reinforcing its value for systematic analysis of synaptic interactions and advancing our understanding of neuronal network dynamics.",

      "title": "Patient-specific long-term seizure prediction via multi-model classification",
      "content": "Objective. Most existing seizure prediction approaches rely on cohort-based models or assume a single model suffices per patient, overlooking clinical and electrophysiological variability across seizures. This study aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a subject-specific seizure prediction framework that models intra-subject heterogeneity by identifying and clustering seizure-specific preictal patterns using long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected over a one to two week duration. Approach: Absolute, relative, and ratio power spectral density features are extracted from twelve frequency bands, and the minimum uncertainty and sample elimination algorithm is used for unsupervised feature selection on a per-seizure basis. Weighted aggregation is then applied to form seizure-specific feature sets. Seizures are grouped into clusters based on feature similarity, and separate classifiers are trained for each cluster. Model predictions are combined using a grid optimized k-of-N voting strategy. Evaluation is conducted on long-term iEEG recordings from ten patients using cross-validation across seizure-containing sessions. Main results. When clustering is applied, the mean sensitivity across subjects is improved from 89.17% to 98.54%, while the mean FPR is reduced from 1.15/day to 0.62/day. Additionally, the median number of features required per subject decreased from 22 to 14, reflecting a 36.4% reduction in model complexity. Finally, in 72.5% of subject-folds, the number of algorithm-identified clusters equaled or exceeded the clinically annotated seizure types, with a linear trend indicating latent electrophysiological variability beyond clinical labels. Significance. These findings highlight the value of modeling seizure diversity within individuals and support the development of more personalized and interpretable seizure forecasting systems.",

      "content": "<p>Easy to use, portable app to play midi music files on all flavours of Microsoft Windows.<p>Brief Background - Used midi playback way back in the days of Windows 95 for some fun and entertaining apps, but as Windows progressed, it seemed their midi support (for Win32 anyway) regressed in both startup speed and reliability.  Midi playback used to be near instant on Windows 95, but on later versions of Windows this was delayed to about 5-7 seconds.  And reliability became somewhat patchy.  This made working with midi a real headache.<p>Cynthia was built to test and enjoy midi music once again.  It's taken over a year of solid coding, recoding, testing, re-testing, and a lot more testing, and some hair pulling along the way, but finally Cynthia works pretty solidly on Windows now.<p>Some of Cynthia's Key Features:\n* 25 built-in sample midis on a virtual disk - play right out-of-the box\n* Play Modes: Once, Repeat One, Repeat All, All Once, Random\n* Play \".mid\", \".midi\" and \".rmi\" midi files in 0 and 1 formats\n* Realtime track data indicators, channel output volume indicators with peak hold, 128 note usage indicators\n* Volume Bars to display realtime average volume and bass volume levels\n* Use an Xbox Controller to control Cynthia's main functions \n* Large list capacity for handling thousands of midi files\n* Switch between up to 10 midi playback devices in realtime\n* Playback through a single midi device, or multiple simultaneous midi devices with lag and channel output support\n* Custom built midi playback engine for high playback stability\n* Custom built codebase for low-level work to GUI level\n* Also runs on Linux/Mac (including apple silicon) via Wine\n* Smart Source Code - compiles in Borland Delphi 3 and Lazarus 2 \n* MIT License<p>YouTube Video of Cynthia playing a midi:\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/IDEOQUboTvQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/IDEOQUboTvQ</a><p>GitHub Repo:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/blaiz2023/Cynthia\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/blaiz2023/Cynthia</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46034145\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46034145</a></p>\n<p>Points: 7</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
