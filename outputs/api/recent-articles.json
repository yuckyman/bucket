      "content": "The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas provides gene expression data for over 20,000 genes and has been extensively used in neuroscience. However, it is constrained by a resolution of 200 {micro}m3. We improved this to 25 {micro}m3 for 4,083 genes by re-registering 401,660 sections to atlas space. From this, we produced an atlas with regions defined by shared molecular signatures and built an interactive online platform allowing exploration of gene expression patterns.",

      "title": "Phosphatidylserine exposure by developing astrocytes initiates microglia-mediated developmental cell death",
      "content": "Developmental cell death is classically attributed to apoptosis, yet in mammalian retina, large numbers of developing astrocytes die non-apoptotically during a defined developmental window. Astrocyte death is important for patterning a cellular template that guides angiogenesis, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that healthy developing astrocytes initiate their own elimination by recruiting microglia via regulated exposure of the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine. Experimentally increasing phosphatidylserine exposure in astrocytes, but not neurons, accelerates their removal by microglia without changing how many astrocytes ultimately survive. This acceleration causes profound vascular defects resembling pathological features of retinopathy of prematurity. Genetic disruption of MFGE8, a phosphatidylserine-binding protein, suppresses microglia-mediated astrocyte killing and prevents vascular pathology despite continued phosphatidylserine exposure. This mechanism extends beyond the retina, because phosphatidylserine also initiates astrocyte death in developing cerebral cortex. Together, these findings identify phosphatidylserine exposure as a developmental signal that times microglia-mediated astrocyte elimination, with essential consequences for neurovascular development.",

      "title": "Preferential vulnerability of cortical GABAergic interneurons to Nalcn deficiency",
      "content": "Neuronal resting membrane potential (RMP) reflects the balance of leak conductances and varies systematically across cortical cell types. Many GABAergic interneurons exhibit more depolarized RMPs than neighbouring excitatory neurons, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these systematic differences in intrinsic excitability remain incompletely defined. The sodium leak channel non-selective (NALCN) mediates a major fraction of basal sodium conductance and cause neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by developmental delay and cognitive impairment. Here we define NALCN contribution to cortical circuit development and function with cell-type precision. Using Nalcn-GFP reporter line, we map Nalcn expression across cortical types revealing enrichment in GABAergic hippocampal interneurons relative to hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Using conditional mouse models, we selectively deleted Nalcn in cortical glutamatergic lineages or forebrain GABAergic cells from early embryogenesis. Electrophysiological analysis show that developmental loss of Nalcn preferentially reduces intrinsic excitability across GABAergic interneuron subtypes while sparing pyramidal neurons. To understand the impact of a depolarized GABAergic RMP on brain function, we assessed the behavioral performance of Nalcn-deficient mice that revealed persistent deficits in contextual adaptation and spatial short-term memory. These findings reveal a neuron type-specific function of NALCN in the cerebral cortex and position NALCN as a crucial ion channel regulating basal excitability of GABAergic inhibitory circuits and cortical circuit function.",

      "title": "Axonal theta oscillations evoke bursting in target hippocampal subregions",
      "content": "Local field potentials (LFPs) measured in the extracellular matrix of the brain are postulated to arise from the integration of synaptic ionic currents and spread by volume conduction. However, there is a lack of consensus on whether these spatiotemporal voltage gradients are just an epiphenomenon of spiking or if the LFPs play a functional role in information processing. To examine a potential functional role of LFPs in information processing, we developed a microfluidic device that allows neurons from the hippocampal formation to self-wire through microfluidic channels, effectively isolating the activity of single axons between subregions of the network. We recorded spontaneous theta-band activity (4-10 Hz) in these axons whose power spectra were independent of simultaneous spiking activity. A sparse set of axons from the CA3 into the CA1 had the highest theta amplitudes. Source neurons for the axonal theta were identified through cross correlation. Functionally, sparse axonal theta phase and amplitude correlated with target subregional spiking and more strongly with burst length. These results suggest that theta voltage oscillations in axons may contribute to activation of slow voltage-gated calcium channels to drive stronger synaptic release of transmitter to coordinate hippocampal activity between subregions. We propose that theta oscillations are controlled by specific ion channels distinct from those that generate spikes, a multiplex coding mechanism for inter-regional communication with implications for routing, executive control, disease states and artificial neural networks.",

      "title": "Coordinated pre- and postsynaptic protein dynamics underlie rapid Sema4D-mediated inhibitory synapse assembly",
      "content": "In the mammalian hippocampus, synapses are either excitatory or inhibitory as defined by the presynaptic neurotransmitter (glutamate or GABA, respectively) and the specific ligand-gated ion channel receptors localized to the postsynaptic specialization. While numerous studies explore the formation of excitatory synapses, the process of inhibitory synapse formation is less understood. Using both loss- and gain-of-function approaches, our lab previously identified the class 4 Semaphorin Sema4D as a key regulator of inhibitory synaptogenesis. Here, using recombinant Sema4D protein as a tool to rapidly induce GABAergic synapse formation in cultured hippocampal neurons, we employ two-channel live imaging to identify changes to pre- and postsynaptic protein dynamics during inhibitory synapse formation. We find that Sema4D treatment promotes the mobility of presynaptic GAD65 protein assemblies while having a negligible effect on the behavior of the postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold, leading to increased colocalization of these proteins. In addition, Sema4D treatment promotes the recruitment of GABAAR{gamma}2 subunits to immature gephyrin scaffolds, suggesting that Sema4D primes these scaffolds for receptor recruitment. Surprisingly, we observe new colocalization events between existing gephyrin and GABAAR puncta, suggesting that clustering of either the gephyrin scaffold or the GABAAR is sufficient to nucleate assembly of the postsynaptic specialization. Overall our results support a model in which Sema4D signaling coordinates dynamic changes in both pre- and postsynaptic compartments to assemble inhibitory synapses on rapid timescales.",

It\u2019s an attempt to explain how Python\u2019s typing system behaves <em>as a system</em> \u2014 how inference, narrowing, boundaries, and async typing interact, and how typing can be used as a way of reasoning about code rather than just silencing linters.</p> <p>It\u2019s long, but modular; you can drop into any section. The main chunks are:</p> <ul> <li>What Python typing is (and is not) good at</li> <li>How checkers resolve ambiguity and refine types (and why inference fails)</li> <li>Typing data at boundaries (TypedDict vs parsing)</li> <li>Structural typing, guards, match, and resolution</li> <li>Async typing and control flow</li> <li>Generics (TypeVar, ParamSpec, higher-order functions)</li> <li>Architectural patterns and tradeoffs</li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019ve ever felt that typing \u201cmostly works but feels opaque,\u201d this is aimed at that gap.</p> <p>If you notice errors, confusing explanations, or places where it breaks down in real usage, I\u2019d appreciate hearing about it \u2014 even partial or section-level feedback helps.</p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/JBogEsq/python_type_hinting_guide\">https://github.com/JBogEsq/python_type_hinting_guide</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JoelBEsq\"> /u/JoelBEsq </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjkwnx/understanding_pythons_typing_system_draft_guide/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qjkwnx/understanding_pythons_typing_system_draft_guide/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis. That\u2019s a huge difference!</p><p class=\"\">We found a similar benefit for SVM-based decoding over conventional ERP analyses in 7 of the 10 cases we tested (see the figure below). In the other 3 cases, the ERP and SVM effects were approximately equivalent. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a downside to using decoding, at least in terms of effect size. But there can be a big benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"1371\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/d16f0782-7205-4d50-95e1-c6729cbc153e/All_Components.png?format=1000w\" width=\"4641\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">Because decoding has many possible benefits, we\u2019ve added it into <a href=\"ERPLAB Toolbox\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>.

      "content": "Conduct disorder (CD) is the leading global cause of mental health burden in children and adolescents and has recently been hypothesized to be a neurodevelopmental disorder. Although prior research has identified neuroanatomical differences associated with CD, it remains unclear whether these differences reflect atypical brain development. Here, we investigated the difference between an individual's brain age and chronological age as a proxy for variations in brain maturation. Using a pretrained model, we estimated brain age from structural neuroimaging data obtained from 1,119 youth with CD and 1,183 typically developing controls across 14 international cohorts participating in the ENIGMA-Antisocial Behavior Working Group. Youth with CD exhibited a statistically robust but small acceleration in brain age compared to typically developing youth (around 0.50 years), which was restricted to the adolescence-onset subtype of the disorder. Our large-scale, coordinated analysis provides the first evidence of accelerated neurodevelopment as a potential mechanism underlying CD.",

      "title": "Organization, Neuronal Composition, and Dynamics of Neuronal Ensembles in the Songbird Auditory Forebrain",
      "content": "Auditory learning is a key component of vocal learning and communication. Neurons involved in auditory learning are typically examined as single encoders, but there is increasing evidence that the coincident activity of groups of neurons, or ensembles, is important for the processing and transmission of sensory information. In songbirds, a forebrain region analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortex, the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), is crucial for representing and learning auditory signals. In the awake state, NCM neurons exhibit stimulus-specific adaptation in response to repeated presentation of song stimuli, considered a form of auditory working memory. Yet, how complex stimuli like song are encoded by networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons is essentially unknown. Using in-vivo single-unit electrophysiology, we systematically unveiled neuronal ensembles that operate at high temporal precision (< 10 ms) across the NCM of awake zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Our data show that multiple ensembles are concurrently activated by song with high temporal precision, and that their neuronal composition is heterogeneous, topographically proximate, and biased towards excitatory members. NCM ensembles adapt to song playback and, notably, become more stimulus selective over tens of minutes, accompanied by fast remodeling (membership gain and/or loss) during adaptation. Altogether, our results suggest that song representations in the forebrain can be conveyed by multiple, dynamic network ensembles in parallel. These findings advance our knowledge of the composition, dynamics, and neuronal network reorganization of ensembles as complex sensory stimuli become increasingly familiar.",
