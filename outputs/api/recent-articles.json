      "title": "Chondroitin 4-sulphate depletion enhances synaptic plasticity and memory in aging",
      "content": "Perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialised extracellular matrix structures enriched in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs), are key regulators of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Aging is characterised by a shift in chondroitin sulphate composition toward increased chondroitin-4-sulfation (C4S) and reduced C6S, a pattern associated with declining cognitive flexibility. Here, we investigated how selective reduction of C4S affects PNN structure, PV-interneuron connectivity, and cognitive performance across the lifespan. Conditional deletion of the C4-sulfotransferase Chst11 markedly reduced C4S levels and diminished dendritic PNN complexity while preserving somatic PNN structure. This partial destabilisation of PNNs increased excitatory synaptic input onto PV interneurons in both young and aged mice, without major alterations in basal hippocampal transmission or long-term potentiation. Behaviourally, Chst11 knockout mice showed robust and persistent protection against age-related cognitive decline. Working memory performance remained stable across aging, short-term spatial memory was enhanced from early adulthood onward, and object recognition memory was significantly prolonged at all retention delays, even in old age. Sociability and social novelty preference were also preserved longer in aging knockouts compared with controls. These improvements occurred despite an overall preservation of PNN architecture, indicating that modifying sulphation rather than removing CSPGs is sufficient to enhance plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that reducing C4S through Chst11 deletion confers long-lasting enhancements in cognitive function and mitigates aging-related decline. Targeting CS-GAG sulphation patterns may therefore represent a promising strategy for maintaining cognitive resilience and restoring plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative conditions.",

      "title": "Diurnality reconfigures circadian network dynamics in the suprachiasmatic nucleus",
      "content": "Diurnal and nocturnal mammals occupy opposite temporal niches, but whether the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker, follows the same intrinsic rules for timing adjustment and network coordination across species is unknown. Because SCN clock gene rhythms and population-level activity measurements look broadly similar across species, the prevailing interpretation in comparative studies has been that temporal niche differences are implemented upstream or downstream of the SCN. However, these coarse readouts do not test how clock resetting depends on circadian phase or how neuronal timing is coordinated across SCN space. Here, we combined long-duration ex vivo SCN recordings with optogenetic stimulation to compare SCN network dynamics in the nocturnal mouse (Mus musculus) and the diurnal four-striped grass mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio). Rhabdomys SCN molecular clock rhythms exhibited a longer intrinsic period and, under the same daily stimulation protocol, converged on a larger absolute phase angle relative to the stimulus. Molecular clock phase response curves differed in overall structure across circadian time between species, including pronounced early subjective day delays in Rhabdomys when Mus responses were minimal. Phase mapping of single-cell SCN calcium rhythms revealed species-specific spatial timing organization, with a graded dorsomedial-to-ventrolateral phase progression in Rhabdomys and a sharper transition in Mus. The Mus and Rhabdomys SCN can thus appear similar by coarse readouts yet diverge in phase-dependent molecular clock resetting and network timing organization. These results indicate that models placing temporal niche divergence solely outside the SCN are mechanistically incomplete.",

      "title": "Divergent Electrophysiological Responses in the Human Hippocampus During Verbal Memory Processing",
      "content": "The profile of electrophysiological responses in the human hippocampus (HPC) during verbal memory processing has remained complex and unclear. Here, we studied 26 patients implanted with intracranial electrodes across 187 HPC sites (50% left, 2-18 per patient). During memory encoding and retrieval, a subset of HPC responsive sites demonstrated increased ripple events, along with elevated high-frequency (HFA >50 Hz), and low-frequency (LFA 1-8 Hz) activity. A nearly equal number of sites showed no changes in ripple rate but increased LFA power and a delayed response-locked decrease in HFA power. More importantly, both successful encoding as well as recognition of remembered words were strongly associated with the coordination of the timing of LFA and HFA increases across the two clusters of responsive HPC sites. Using direct cortical electrical stimulations, we confirmed overlapping, but partially distinct, cortical connections to the functionally distinct HPC clusters. Our findings suggest a mesoscale mosaic functional organization within the human HPC where adjacent sites with divergent electrophysiological responses may have specialized roles during verbal memory processing. More importantly, our findings suggest that successful human memory depends on the coordination of the timing of low and high frequency local fields generated across these functionally divergent neuronal population sites.",

      "title": "LSD Reconfigures Cortical Dynamics Through Faster Brain Rhythms and Increased Fractal Dimension",
      "content": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) profoundly alters conscious experience, yet the electrophysiological mechanisms by which it reshapes neural dynamics remain incompletely understood. A hallmark of psychedelic states is widespread cortical desynchronization, typically inferred from reductions in spectral power, but whether such effects reflect genuine weakening of neural oscillations or are confounded by shifts in oscillatory peak frequencies remains unresolved. Here, we address this gap by combining source-resolved magnetoencephalography (MEG), spectral parameterization, temporal complexity metrics, and interpretable machine learning in an LSD versus placebo design, with and without music. We show that LSD induces robust, spatially structured increases in alpha and beta peak frequencies alongside genuine attenuation of oscillatory power, with these effects displaying partly dissociable cortical patterns. Beyond rhythmic activity, LSD is associated with flattening of the aperiodic 1/f spectral slope and increased neural signal complexity and fractality, preferentially affecting sensory, language, emotion, and imagery-related networks while sparing motor cortex. Machine-learning analyses further identify peak-frequency shifts, aperiodic parameters, and complexity measures as key discriminators of the psychedelic state. Music does not robustly amplify these neural signatures and instead shows a trend toward attenuation. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive electrophysiological account of how LSD reorganizes large-scale human brain dynamics and highlight features that may differentiate its neural signature from that of other psychedelics.",

      "title": "Individual Dynamics in Stress-Related Pain Responses",
      "content": "Background: Stress and pain are two adaptive mechanisms, driving human behavior and cognition. They are bidirectionally related, and modulating factors such as sleep or physical activity were identified. However, how stable individual differences in pain-related distress, including individual dispositions for pain catastrophizing, and person-specific pain sensitivities relate to the strength of stress responses remains unclear. This preregistered study closes this gap by investigating how trait pain-related distress and pain sensitivity changes relate to individuals stress response. Methods: Trait pain-related distress was assessed in 148 healthy males with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, and the Fear of Pain Questionnaire. Baseline blood pressure, pulse rate, alpha-amylase, and cortisol were obtained as well as initial heat pain thresholds and tolerances. One participant group underwent the Maastricht Acute Stress Task, while a control group performed the placebo version of this task, and consecutively all stress- and experimental pain indicators were examined again. Results: Individuals with lower kinesiophobia demonstrated higher stress-induced increases in alpha-amylase. Furthermore, stress-induced changes in pain sensitivity showed high individual variability, but were not associated with the stress response. Finally, in individuals with a higher tendency to catastrophize and to fear pain, stronger alpha-amylase increases were associated with larger post-stressor increases in pain threshold, indicating reduced pain sensitivity. Conclusion: Our study suggests that stable individual differences influence the stress-pain link beyond physiology. This underscores the importance of considering trait differences in future research on stress-pain interactions with the goal of better tailoring preventions and treatments for patients with chronic pain.",

      "content": "Mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction are central features of Parkinson's disease (PD) across major genetic forms including PRKN, SNCA, and LRRK2. We applied cell morphomics, a machine-learning-based framework combining high-content imaging with quantitative feature extraction, to analyse mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology at single-cell resolution in iPS cell-derived cortical neurons from PD patients and healthy controls (13 lines total). Supervised machine-learning models distinguished PD neurons from controls with high accuracy (AUC = 0.87) and reliably separated individual genotypes. Feature importance and attribution analysis revealed genotype-specific organelle biases, with mitochondrial features dominating classification in PRKN neurons, balanced mitochondrial and lysosomal contributions in SNCA neurons, and a greater lysosomal contribution in LRRK2 neurons. Multi-class models retained strong performance, and findings were reproduced across two independent laboratories using different dyes and imaging conditions. These results demonstrate that morphomics provides a robust and scalable framework to quantify genotype-specific organelle abnormalities in PD neurons and supports its application for cellular stratification and biomarker discovery.",

      "title": "Proactive visual and motor prioritization differentially scale with cue reliability",
      "content": "Environmental cues enable the brain to anticipate and prepare for upcoming behavior, such as by selectively prioritizing relevant visual representations and associated action plans in working memory in service of an imminent task. While it has been demonstrated that neural dynamics of visual and motor prioritization each scale with cue reliability, studies to date tracked either visual or motor prioritization in isolation. It therefore remains unknown whether visual and motor prioritization scale similarly or differently with cue reliability. To fill this gap, we manipulated cue reliability (100%, 80%, 60%) in a visual-motor working-memory task that uniquely enabled us to isolate the neural dynamics associated with visual and motor prioritization in anticipation of an imminent working-memory task. EEG measurements in male and female human volunteers revealed how cue reliability differentially drives visual and motor prioritization. While the strength and timing of visual prioritization were largely invariant to cue reliability, motor prioritization profoundly scaled with cue reliability and developed more gradually with lower certainty. These findings show that visual and motor prioritization in working memory are differentially susceptible to the certainty conveyed by environmental cues, and suggest that motor prioritization may be more cautious in nature.",

      "title": "Rethinking the IDE: Moving from text files to a graph-based IDE",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><h1>What My Project Does</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC(Virtual Node Code) is a graph\u2011based IDE that sits on top of your existing files. Instead of treating code as a long list of text files, it treats the codebase like a map that you can navigate, zoom into, and filter based on what you are working on.</p> <p>The source code stays exactly the same. The graph is an additional structural layer used only for understanding, navigation, debugging, and tooling.</p> <p>The main idea is to reduce the mental effort required to understand large or unfamiliar codebases for both humans and LLMs by making structure explicit and persistent.</p> <h1>The Problem It Tries to Solve</h1> <p>Modern development is built almost entirely around files. Files are not real structures \u2014 they are flat text. They only make sense when a human or an LLM reads them and reconstructs the logic in their head.</p> <p>Because of this, code, logs, and documentation are disorganized by default. There is no real connection being tracked between them.</p> <p>This forces a bottom\u2011up way of working. To understand or change one small thing, you often need to understand many other parts first. You start from low\u2011level details and slowly work your way up, even when your goal is high\u2011level.</p> <p>In practice, this means humans are doing a computer\u2019s job. We repeatedly read files, trace function calls, and rebuild a mental model of the system in our heads. That model is fragile and temporary it disappears when we switch tasks or move to another part of the codebase.</p> <p>As the codebase grows, this problem grows much faster than the code itself. More files, more functions, and more connections create chaos. The number of relationships you need to remember increases rapidly, and the mental energy required to keep everything straight becomes overwhelming. Current file-based systems mix concerns and force you to load unrelated context just to understand one small change.</p> <p>Instead of spending energy on reasoning or design, developers spend it on remembering where things are and how they connect work the computer could track automatically.</p> <h1>How V\u2011NOC Works (High Level)</h1> <h1>Graph\u2011Based Structure</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC builds a graph\u2011based structure on top of your existing files. The physical folder and file hierarchy is converted into a graph, using the existing structure as the top level so it still feels familiar.</p> <p>Every file and folder is assigned a stable ID. Its identity stays the same even if it is renamed or moved. This allows notes, documentation, logs, and history to stay attached to the logic itself instead of breaking when paths change.</p> <h1>Deep Logic Extraction (Static and Dynamic Analysis)</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC goes deeper than files. Using static analysis, every function and class is extracted and treated as a first\u2011class node in the graph.</p> <p>Dynamic analysis is then used to understand how the code actually runs. By combining both, V\u2011NOC builds accurate call graphs and full call chains for each function.</p> <p>This makes it possible to focus only on the functions involved in a specific flow. V\u2011NOC can slice those functions out of their original files and present them together in a single, focused view.</p> <p>Only the functions that participate in the selected call chain are shown. Everything else \u2014 unrelated functions, files, and boilerplate is temporarily hidden. Instead of manually tracing code and rebuilding a mental model, the structure is already there and reflects how the system works in the real world.</p> <h1>Semantic Grouping (Reducing Noise)</h1> <p>Large projects naturally create visual and cognitive noise. To manage this, V\u2011NOC allows semantic grouping.</p> <p>Related nodes can be grouped into virtual categories. For example, if a class contains many functions, the create, update, and delete logic can be grouped into a single node like \u201cCRUD.\u201d</p> <p>These groups are completely non\u2011destructive. They don\u2019t change the source code, file layout, or imports. They only change how the system is viewed, allowing you to work at a higher level and zoom into details only when needed.</p> <h1>Integrated Context (Logs and Documentation)</h1> <p>Because every function has a stable ID, documentation and logs can be attached directly to the function node.</p> <p>Logs are no longer a disconnected stream of text in a separate file. They live where they were produced. When an error occurs, you can see the exact function where it happened, the documentation for that function, and the visual call chain that led to the failure all in one place.</p> <p>Debugging becomes more direct and less about searching.</p> <h1>Context Control and Scaling</h1> <p>One of the core goals of V\u2011NOC is context control.</p> <p>As the codebase grows, the amount of context you need does not grow with it. You can view a single function as if it were the entire project, with everything outside its call graph hidden automatically.</p> <p>This keeps mental load roughly the same whether the project has 10 files or 10,000. The computer keeps track of the complexity so humans don\u2019t have to.</p> <h1>Benefits for LLMs</h1> <p>This structure is especially useful for LLMs.</p> <p>Today, LLMs are fed large amounts of raw text, which wastes tokens on irrelevant files and forces the model to reconstruct structure on its own. In a graph\u2011based system, an LLM can query only the exact neighborhood of a function.</p> <p>It can receive the specific function, its call graph, related documentation, and relevant runtime logs without loading the rest of the codebase. This removes wasted context and allows the model to focus on reasoning instead of structure discovery.</p> <h1>Target Audience</h1> <p>V\u2011NOC is currently a working prototype. It mostly works as intended, but it is not production\u2011ready yet and still needs improvements in performance and some refinement in the UI and workflow.</p> <p>The project is intended for:</p> <ul> <li>All developers, especially those working with large or long\u2011lived codebases</li> <li>Developers who need to understand, explore, or learn unfamiliar codebases quickly</li> <li>Teams onboarding new contributors to complex systems</li> <li>Anyone interested in alternative IDE concepts and developer\u2011experience tooling</li> <li>LLM\u2011based tools and agents that need structured, precise access to code instead of raw text</li> </ul> <p>The goal is to make complex systems easier to understand and reason about whether the \u201cuser\u201d is a human developer or an AI agent.</p> <h1>Comparison to Existing Tools</h1> <p>Traditional IDEs and editors are primarily file\u2011centric. Understanding a system usually depends on search, jumping between files, and manually tracing logic. The structure of the code exists, but it has to be rebuilt mentally each time by the developer or the tool.</p> <p>V\u2011NOC takes a different approach by making structure the primary interface. Instead of starting from files, it provides a persistent and queryable representation of how the code is actually organized and how it behaves at runtime. The goal is not to replace text editing, but to add a structural layer that makes relationships explicit and always available.</p> <p>Some newer tools focus on chat\u2011based or agent\u2011driven interfaces that try to hide complexity from the user. While this can feel clean and convenient at first, it often works by summarizing or abstracting away important details. Over time, that hidden complexity still exists \u2014 it just becomes harder to see, verify, or reason about. It\u2019s similar to cleaning a room by pushing everything under the bed: things look neat initially, but the mess doesn\u2019t go away and eventually becomes harder to deal with.</p> <p>V\u2011NOC takes the opposite approach. It does not hide complexity; instead it make complex codebases easy to verify, It structures code so context can be controlled: you can work at a high level to understand overall flows, then move down to exact functions and call paths when you need details, without losing focus or trust in what you\u2019re seeing. The same underlying structure is used at every level, which allows both humans and LLMs to inspect real relationships directly, confirm assumptions against the actual code, and update understanding incrementally without pulling in unrelated context as the system grows.<br /> Rather than removing complexity from view, V\u2011NOC aims to make complexity navigable, so both humans and LLMs can work with real systems confidently as they grow.</p> <h1>Project Links</h1> <ul> <li>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/v-noc/IDE\">https://github.com/v-noc/IDE</a></li> <li>Hosted example using a real\u2011world codebase: <a href=\"https://vnoc.vercel.app/project/2dd75e19-5c7b-4fd1-b272-44a1c94dd8eb\">https://vnoc.vercel.app/project/2dd75e19-5c7b-4fd1-b272-44a1c94dd8eb</a></li> <li>Short demo videos: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g_fqTHdC3IRV_CcwuvixTYDHjrXPIfCS/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g_fqTHdC3IRV_CcwuvixTYDHjrXPIfCS/view</a> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ouNPtowRVKH7bwFby6VeQ59o_29z4uNW/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ouNPtowRVKH7bwFby6VeQ59o_29z4uNW/view</a></li> </ul> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/yared12qw\"> /u/yared12qw </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqj5vd/rethinking_the_ide_moving_from_text_files_to_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqj5vd/rethinking_the_ide_moving_from_text_files_to_a/\">[comments]</a></span>",
