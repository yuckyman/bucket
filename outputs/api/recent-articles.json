      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

      "title": "Lactylation in post-stroke fatigue: linking metabolic dysregulation to neuroinflammation",
      "content": "Lactylation, a recently identified post-translational modification derived from lactate, has emerged as a key immunometabolic regulator in neurological disorders. In the context of ischemic stroke, abnormal lactate accumulation not only reflects energy metabolism dysfunction but also drives protein lactylation, which dynamically influences neuronal survival, glial activation, and neuroinflammatory cascades. Increasing evidence indicates that lactylation modulates transcriptional programs of microglia and astrocytes, amplifying inflammatory responses through histone modifications and metabolic enzyme regulation. These processes contribute critically to the onset and persistence of post-stroke fatigue (PSF), a debilitating complication that impairs recovery and quality of life in stroke survivors. This review integrates recent findings on lactylation-mediated regulation of immune and inflammatory pathways, with a particular focus on its effects on apoptosis-related signaling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytokine production. Furthermore, we highlight lactylation-related enzymes, including p300 and HDAC3, as potential therapeutic targets, and discuss emerging biomarkers for monitoring lactylation dynamics in stroke patients. By framing lactylation as a metabolic\u2013epigenetic bridge connecting cellular energy states with immune responses, this article provides new insights into the immunopathogenesis of PSF and identifies promising directions for translational intervention.",

      "content": "IntroductionTranscranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) with near-infrared light is a promising non-invasive method to enhance cognition and support brain health. However, its mechanistic effects on large-scale cortical dynamics remain poorly understood. Establishing how tPBM reorganizes oscillatory hierarchies is critical for advancing both neuroscience and clinical translation.MethodsWe examined whether acute 1,064-nm tPBM modulates oscillatory power, dipole source trajectories, and functional connectivity in the human brain. Simultaneous magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) were recorded in 25 healthy adults before and after prefrontal tPBM. Distributed source imaging (sLORETA) and global optimization dipole modeling characterized spatiotemporal alpha and beta activity. Connectivity was assessed with phase transfer entropy, and infra-slow phase\u2013amplitude coupling analyses assessed hierarchical modulation.ResultsTranscranial photobiomodulation induced frequency-specific reorganization of cortical networks. Alpha oscillations engaged coordinated fronto\u2013visual circuits, whereas beta activity preferentially recruited higher-order executive regions. Source imaging revealed a post-stimulation shift from default mode toward central executive network dominance with stronger directed interactions. Infra-slow rhythms (<0.1 Hz), encompassing both very-low-frequency (0.01\u20130.1 Hz) and ultra-slow (<0.01 Hz) activity, significantly modulated alpha- and beta-band amplitudes, embedding faster oscillations within slower temporal patterns.DiscussionThe findings of his work indicate that tPBM influences intrinsic brain activity by reorganizing oscillatory patterns and shifting network engagement. The redistribution from default mode toward executive systems, along with the nesting of faster rhythms within slower temporal structures, reflects a capacity for large-scale functional rebalancing. The results highlight tPBM\u2019s potential as a precision neuromodulation tool for modulating executive and cognitive control systems.",

      "title": "Impact of sex differences on clinical characteristics of anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis during the acute phase: a single-center retrospective study",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo elucidate the influence of sex differences on the clinical characteristics of anti-NMDAR encephalitis during the acute phase.MethodsPatients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis who were hospitalized at Huanhu Hospital, affiliated with Tianjin University, from January 2020 to January 2025 were collected. They were divided into two groups: male and female. Clinical data for both groups were gathered, including age, history of prodromal infection, clinical manifestations, complications, presence of tumor, laboratory indices, MRI findings, GCS scores, length of hospital stay, treatment regimens, and acute phase outcomes. Statistical methods were employed to compare the differences between the two groups.ResultsA total of 43 patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis were included in this study, comprising 20 male patients (46.51%) and 23 female patients (53.49%). Female patients were more likely to exhibit decreased levels of consciousness compared to male patients (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f4.113, p\u202f=\u202f0.043). Additionally, the antibody titers in CSF of female patients were significantly higher than those in male patients too (Z\u202f=\u202f\u22122.870, p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Interestingly, CSF protein levels were higher in male patients than in female patients (Z\u202f=\u202f\u22122.591, p\u202f=\u202f0.019), and male patients were more prone to test positive for anti-MOG antibodies (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f5.715, p\u202f=\u202f0.017). The treatment improvement rate for female patients was lower than that for male patients (Z\u202f=\u202f4.768, p\u202f=\u202f0.029), and family members of female patients were more likely to automatic discharge (\u03c72\u202f=\u202f4.075, p\u202f=\u202f0.044).ConclusionFemale patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis experience greater challenges and difficulties compared to male patients. Therefore, it is necessary to choose more proactive treatment options for female patients to help reduce the risk of adverse outcome in acute phase.",

      "title": "Impact of binaural beat stimulation on working memory: a graph theory network approach",
      "content": "IntroductionBinaural beat (BB) stimulation has been shown to enhance working memory (WM); however, its role in information segregation and neural processing mechanisms remains insufficiently explored. This study hypothesized that improvements in WM recall are associated with enhanced \u03b8-band\u2013mediated information segregation in frontal brain regions.MethodsSixty healthy participants were randomly assigned to three BB stimulation groups: Group A (\u03b1-BB, 10 Hz), Group B (\u03b2-BB, 14 Hz), and Group C (\u03b3-BB, 30 Hz). Electroencephalography (EEG; 14 channels, 128 Hz sampling rate) was recorded before (Pre), during (Du), and after (Post) BB stimulation. Cognitive performance was assessed using a digit-span test. EEG power spectra and graph-theoretical network metrics were analyzed across \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 frequency bands. Correlations between EEG measures and cognitive changes were computed, and paired t-tests were used to compare Pre-, Du-, and Post-BB conditions.Results\u03b8-band activity showed a significant positive correlation with cognitive improvements, particularly in frontal and parietal regions. Group A demonstrated significant increases in \u03b8-band clustering coefficient and local efficiency at both global and fronto-parietal network levels, along with enhanced in-degree and out-degree centrality. Group C exhibited increased \u03b8-band clustering coefficient during the Post-BB phase and greater betweenness centrality in fronto-parietal regions. No comparable effects were observed in Group B.DiscussionThe findings indicate that BB stimulation, particularly at \u03b1 and \u03b3 frequencies, enhances WM performance through \u03b8-band\u2013mediated improvements in brain network efficiency and information segregation. These results support the potential of BB stimulation as a non-pharmacological approach for cognitive enhancement and provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying WM modulation.",
