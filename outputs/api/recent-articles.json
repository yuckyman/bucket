      "title": "Show HN: Chart Preview \u2013 Preview environments for Helm charts on every PR",
      "content": "<p>I\u2019m a software engineer who accidentally became my team\u2019s Kubernetes person \u2014 and eventually the bottleneck for every Helm chart PR.<p>I built Chart Preview so reviewers could see Helm chart changes running without waiting on me.<p>A few years ago, my team needed to implement HA for an existing product, which meant deploying on Kubernetes and OpenShift. I spent months learning Kubernetes, Helm, and the surrounding ecosystem. After that, Kubernetes largely became \u201cmy thing\u201d on the team.<p>We later published public Helm charts for the product, and customers started submitting PRs. Those PRs would often sit for months \u2014 not because the changes were bad, but because testing them meant manually spinning up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the chart with the proposed changes, running through test scenarios, and coordinating verification with product and QA. Since I was the only one who could reliably set up those environments, everything waited on me.<p>I kept thinking: what if the PR itself showed the changes working? What if reviewers could just click a link and see it deployed?<p>That idea became Chart Preview.<p>Chart Preview deploys your Helm chart to a real Kubernetes cluster when you open a PR, provides a unique preview URL for that PR, and cleans everything up automatically when the PR closes.<p>I started by solving a problem I was personally hitting, rather than surveying the whole market upfront. As I built more of it, I looked at existing preview tools and noticed that while there are solid solutions for previewing container-based applications, Helm-specific workflows introduce different challenges \u2014 chart dependencies, layered values files, and opinionated chart structures. That pushed me to focus Chart Preview on being Helm-native first, rather than adapting a container preview workflow to fit Helm.<p>Under the hood, it\u2019s built in Go using the Helm v3 SDK. The architecture is an API server with workers pulling jobs from a PostgreSQL queue \u2014 no Kubernetes operator, just services talking directly to the Kubernetes API. Each preview runs in its own namespace with deny-all NetworkPolicies, ResourceQuotas, and LimitRanges. GitHub integration is done via a GitHub App for check runs and webhooks, with GitLab supported via the REST API.<p>There were a few interesting challenges along the way. Injecting preview hostnames into Ingress resources without corrupting manifests took several iterations. Helm uninstall doesn\u2019t always clean everything up, so deleting the entire namespace turned out to be the safest fallback. Handling rapid pushes to the same PR required build numbering so the latest push always wins. And while the Helm SDK is powerful, it\u2019s under-documented \u2014 I spent a lot of time reading Helm\u2019s source code.<p>I\u2019ve been building and testing this for a few months using real charts like Grafana, podinfo, and WordPress to validate the workflow. It\u2019s early, but it works, and now I\u2019m trying to understand whether other teams have the same pain point I did.<p>You can try it by installing the GitHub App here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apps/chart-preview\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/apps/chart-preview</a><p>I\u2019d love feedback on a few things:<p>Does this solve a real problem for your team, or is shared staging \u201cgood enough\u201d?<p>What\u2019s missing that would make you actually use it?<p>Are there Helm charts this wouldn\u2019t work for? (Cluster-scoped resources are intentionally blocked.)<p>Happy to answer questions about the implementation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46337764\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46337764</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to share a project I\u2019ve been developing called <strong>Pyrium</strong>. It\u2019s a server-side meta-loader designed to bring the ease of Python to Minecraft server modding, but with a focus on performance and safety that you usually don't see in scripting solutions.</p> <h1>\ud83d\ude80 &quot;Wait, isn't Python slow?&quot;</h1> <p>That\u2019s the first question everyone asks. Pyrium does <strong>not</strong> run a slow CPython interpreter inside your server. Instead, it uses a custom <strong>Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compiler</strong> that translates Python code into a specialized instruction set called <strong>PyBC (Pyrium Bytecode)</strong>.</p> <p>This bytecode is then executed by a highly optimized, Java-based <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> running inside the JVM. This means you get Python\u2019s clean syntax but with execution speeds much closer to native Java/Lua, without the overhead of heavy inter-process communication.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Why use a VM-based approach?</h1> <p>Most server-side scripts (like Skript or Denizen) or raw Java mods can bring down your entire server if they hit an infinite loop or a memory leak.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sandboxing:</strong> Every Pyrium mod runs in its own isolated VM instance.</li> <li><strong>Determinism:</strong> The VM can monitor instruction counts. If a mod starts &quot;misbehaving,&quot; the VM can halt it without affecting the main server thread.</li> <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Mods are isolated from the JVM and each other.</li> </ul> <h1>\ud83c\udfa8 Automatic Asset Management (The ResourcePackBuilder)</h1> <p>One of the biggest pains in server-side modding is managing textures.

UML can.</li> <li><strong>VS Monkey Patching:</strong> Standard monkey patching replaces the entire function object. If you only want to change one line or a local variable, you usually have to copy-paste the whole function, which breaks compatibility. UML injects only the necessary logic into the existing AST.</li> <li><strong>VS Other Languages:</strong> This brings the <strong>&quot;Mixin&quot; (Java/Minecraft)</strong> or <strong>&quot;Harmony&quot; (C#/Unity)</strong> style of modding to Python, which has been largely missing in the ecosystem.</li> </ul> <p><strong>The &quot;Magic&quot; (Example)</strong></p> <p>Let's say you have a function with <strong>a local value that is impossible to control from the outside</strong>:</p> <pre><code># target.py import random def attack(self): # The dice roll happens INSIDE the function. # Standard decorators cannot touch this local 'roll' variable. roll = random.randint(1, 100) if roll == 100: print(&quot;Critical Hit!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Miss...&quot;) </code></pre> <p>With my loader, you can intercept the <code>randint</code> call and <strong>force its return value to 100</strong>, guaranteeing a Critical Hit:</p> <pre><code># mods/your_mod.py import universal_modloader as uml # Hook AFTER 'randint' is called, but BEFORE the 'if' check @uml.Inject(&quot;target&quot;, &quot;attack&quot;, at=uml.At.INVOKE(&quot;randint&quot;, shift=uml.Shift.AFTER)) def force_luck(ctx): # Overwrite the return value of randint() ctx['__return__'] = 100 </code></pre> <p><strong>What else can it do?</strong></p> <p>I've included several examples in the repository:</p> <ul> <li><strong>FastAPI (Security)</strong>: Dumping plaintext passwords and bypassing authentication.</li> <li><strong>Tkinter (GUI)</strong>: Modernizing legacy apps with theme injection and widget overlays.</li> <li><strong>Pandas (Data Engineering)</strong>: Injecting progress bars and timers without adding dependencies.</li> <li><strong>CLI Games</strong>: Implementing &quot;God Mode&quot; and &quot;Speedhacks&quot;.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Zero Setup</strong></p> <p>No <code>pip install</code> required for the target. Just drop the loader and mods into the folder and run <code>python loader.py target.py</code>.</p> <p><strong>Source Code</strong></p> <p>It's currently in Alpha (v0.1.0).
