It is possible to download\nall files in a zip folder that will be called \u2018osfstorage-archive.zip\u2019 when\ndownloaded. But as the OSF supports a nested folder structure, you might miss a\nfolder, and you will quickly end up with \u2018osfstorage-archive (1).zip\u2019, \u2018osfstorage-archive\n(2).zip\u2019, etc. Unzipping these archives creates a lot of files without the\norganized folder structure, in folders with meaningless names, making it\ndifficult to understand where files are. </span></p>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span lang=\"EN-US\">The\nosf_file_download function in Papercheck </span></b></h2>\n\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">We have added\na new function to our R package \u2018<a href=\"https://scienceverse.github.io/papercheck/\">Papercheck</a>\u2019 that will download all files and\nfolders in an OSF repository.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "content": "External disturbances to the body are better counteracted when their nature can be predicted in advance. Here, we investigated the neural mechanisms through which probabilistic predictions shape feedback responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. We show that, prior to a mechanical perturbation applied to a finger, the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices receive a signal that linearly encodes the expected sensory input. When perturbations reach these areas, expectations are combined with the sensory input through a simple additive mechanism, yielding motor commands that reflect a weighted sum of the two signals. At the same time, M1 and S1 receive a prediction error signal, likely from upstream regions, encoding the difference between expectations and actual sensory input.

      "title": "Persistent Hypersensitivity after Repeat Concussion is Associated with Chronic Cognitive Dysfunction",
      "content": "Persistent sensory hypersensitivity is a common but under-recognized feature of post-concussion syndrome (PCS) following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and may contribute to chronic cognitive complaints. However, the mechanistic relationship between long-term sensory dysregulation and cognitive dysfunction after repeat concussion remains poorly understood. Here, we used a preclinical repeated closed-head injury (rCHI-5x), in young adult mouse model targeting the frontal cortex at 8weeks of age to test whether chronic sensory processing abnormalities contribute to cognitive impairment under increased sensory load chronically at 8-10weeks post-injury (4months old). rCHI mice exhibited significant sensory dysfunction across multiple modalities compared to sham anesthetic controls, including increased tactile sensitivity, tactile avoidance, and impaired habituation to auditory startle, despite the absence of gross structural brain damage and preserved learning and memory under low-demand conditions. While spatial learning and working memory in the Barnes maze were intact, rCHI mice displayed increased perseveration and reduced cognitive flexibility. However, these cognitive deficits emerged only when auditory and tactile sensory distractors were introduced during testing, unmasking impairments that were not evident under baseline conditions. Within-animal analyses revealed strong associations between the severity of sensory hypersensitivity, impaired sensory habituation, and deficits in cognitive flexibility, relationships in rCHI mice but not in sham controls. These findings demonstrate that chronic sensory dysregulation following repeat mild concussion is not merely a secondary symptom, but can be a mechanistic contributor to cognitive impairment under conditions of elevated sensory load. Together, this work identifies persistent sensory processing and gating dysfunction as a key driver of PCS-related cognitive deficits and reveals that targeting sensory circuitry for therapeutic neuromodulation may offer functional rescue across multiple domains, extending beyond sensory symptoms to improve higher-order cognitive performance.",

      "content": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a powerful, non-invasive window into white matter (WM) development. Yet, most existing processing pipelines are not well-suited to the rapidly evolving neurophysiology of the pediatric brain. Here, we introduce sf-pediatric, a scalable, end-to-end, age-adaptable dMRI pipeline that integrates normative models of brain diffusivities to enable optimal subject-specific analysis from birth through 18 years old. Leveraging normative trajectories derived from nearly 2,000 participants from six cohorts, sf-pediatric dynamically calibrates diffusion priors, template selection, segmentation, and WM atlases based on the subject's age. By incorporating automatic quality control into a portable, tested, containerized, open-access, and press-button framework across computing environments, sf-pediatric provides a robust pipeline for large-scale pediatric dMRI studies. We validated this approach by showing improved local modeling and cortical fanning while preserving reproducibility and the ability to derive brain-behavior relationships. Additionally, we demonstrated robust recovery of known developmental trajectories of WM microstructure and connectome-derived network organization.",

      "content": "Gap junctions are important regulators of the biology of neural stem cells. Both in vertebrates with regenerative abilities and neonatal rodents, ependymal cells communicate via connexin (Cx) 43 and Cx26. Gap junction coupling and Cx26 are down-regulated as the ependyma becomes quiescent in adulthood, but injury overrules this developmental down-regulation suggesting a role for Cx signalling in the reactivation of ependymal cells. Here, we aim to explore the role of Cx26 and Cx43 in the response of ependymal cells to injury. We find that Cx26 is critical for the proliferative response to injury and thereby scar formation. Cx43 plays a key role in the communication between ependymal cells of Ca2+ signals induced by activation of P2X7 receptors that trigger downstream events. Our data show that Cxs are relevant targets to manipulate the ependymal stem cell niche to achieve a better self-repair after spinal cord injury.",
