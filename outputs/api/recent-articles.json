      "title": "Coherence in the brain unfolds across separable temporal regimes",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.20481v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Coherence in language requires the brain to satisfy two competing temporal demands: gradual accumulation of meaning across extended context and rapid reconfiguration of representations at event boundaries. Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Identification of molecular and clinical ALS subgroups based on TDP-43 loss of function molecular markers from population-based patient-derived iPS motor neurons",
      "content": "Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cortical and spinal motor neuron loss, with most patients surviving only 2-5 years post-diagnosis. While approximately 10% of cases are familial (fALS), the remaining 90% are sporadic (sALS) with unknown genetic drivers. Importantly, clinical presentations are heterogeneous in both sporadic and familial ALS, underscoring the complexity of the disease. A pathological hallmark of ALS is the mislocalization of RNA binding protein TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This mislocalization produces both loss-of-function consequences, such as widespread RNA processing and splicing defects, as well as potential toxic gain-of-function effects associated with cytoplasmic aggregation. Results: In this study, we used RT-PCR data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons derived from 180 sALS and C9orf72 fALS patients from the Answer ALS collection to identify biological subgroups based on TDP-43 loss-of-function signatures. Spectral embedding revealed four distinct molecular clusters, including one subgroup genetically similar to controls and another with the most dysregulated mRNA expression, suggesting differing disease severity. Linear mixed models were then used to assess the longitudinal trajectory of over 90 clinical measures, and the between-cluster interaction effects were evaluated. Conclusions: 36 clinical outcomes showed significant differences across clusters, supporting the presence of biologically and clinically distinct ALS subtypes based on the TDP-43-associated pathogenic cascade. These findings demonstrate a critical role of RNA profiling in uncovering biologically meaningful subtypes of ALS, potentially allowing for more precise prognostic tools and the development of future personalized therapeutic approaches.",

      "title": "FAM84B facilitates tau propagation via RYR3-mediated exocytosis in response to neuroinflammation",
      "content": "The increasing prevalence of dementia underscores the pressing need for effective therapeutic interventions. Despite extensive research into A{beta}, the limited efficacy of existing treatment modalities necessitates a paradigm shift toward tau pathology including tau propagation to slow dementia progression. Here, we identified a novel protein, FAM84B (also known as LRATD2), involved in tau propagation. Elevated FAM84B levels were detected in the postmortem cortex, cerebrospinal fluid, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons of patients with tauopathy. FAM84B facilitates tau secretion through exosome assembly and RYR3-mediated exocytosis, followed by exosomal uptake into neighboring cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, thereby driving tau propagation. We confirmed that neuroinflammation induced by heightened STAT3 activity and cytokine treatment upregulated FAM84B expression, stimulating tau propagation, as evidenced by reduced propagation upon RYR3 inhibition. These findings provide invaluable insights into potential avenues for targeting tau propagation to ameliorate disease progression in tauopathies.",

      "title": "Oestradiol and Progesterone Variability in Adolescent Females: Associations with Brain Structure and Mental Health Problems",
      "content": "Objective: Adolescent females are at increased risk for adverse mental health problems, and puberty is thought to be a critical factor. Pubertal onset involves substantial variability in oestradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4), yet the impact of these hormone dynamics remains unclear. We investigated whether within-individual E2 and P4 variability across one month relates to brain structure and mental health problems in adolescent females. Methods: Participants were 147 females (11 to 17 years) from the community-based, cross-sectional Puberty and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescents (PANDA) study in Australia. Salivary E2 and P4 were collected weekly for one month, with variability indexed as within-subject standard deviation. Structural MRI was acquired on the final sampling day. Mental health problems were assessed via self- and parent-report. Linear regression and mediation analyses tested associations between hormone variability, brain structure, and mental health, adjusting for demographics. Results: Greater P4 variability was associated with smaller left thalamus volume (d = -0.26, pFDR = 0.031). Higher E2 variability was associated with fewer anxiety (d = -0.170, pFDR = 0.043) and depressive symptoms (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), lower emotion dysregulation (d = -0.179, pFDR = 0.036), and smaller right hippocampus volume in pre-menarchal adolescents (d = -0.192, p = 0.02). Weekly reductions in E2 predicted lower positive affect (d = 0.084, p = 0.048). Conclusion: These findings indicate that hormone variability may meaningfully shape brain and behavioural development in adolescent girls differently from hormone-related transitions in adulthood. Larger, replicable, and longer-term studies are needed to confirm these patterns.",

      "content": "Dopamine (DA) is an important neuromodulator that has been suggested to play key roles in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. However, its computational impact at the neural circuit level has not been elucidated. Here, we extended a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-based single-neuron spatio-temporal pattern detection model by incorporating a DA input and DA-type STDP modulation. We analyzed the direct effect of the DA-type STDP curve and the effect of DA release. We found that the DA-type STDP curve accelerates learning but may promote coarse potentiation of the synaptic efficacy, which leads to false detections. It was also shown that DA can improve the pattern-detection performance up to a 44 percent success rate (2.44 times control) with no false detection, but a DA release with an excessive amount or with too short a delay induces false detection. These results suggest that DA can maintain the pattern detection ability only when released within a limited concentration and a sufficient delay.",

      "title": "Organization of mouse prefrontal cortex subnetwork revealed by spatial single-cell multi-omic analysis of SPIDER-Seq",
      "content": "Deciphering the connectome, anatomy, transcriptome and spatial-omics integrated multi-modal brain atlas and the underlying organization principles remains a great challenge. We developed a Single-cell Projectome-transcriptome In situ Deciphering Sequencing (SPIDER-Seq) technique by combining viral barcoding tracing with single-cell sequencing and spatial-omics. This empowers us to delineate a integrated single-cell spatial molecular, cellular, anatomic and projectomic atlas of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC). The projectomic and transcriptomic cell clusters display distinct modular organization principles, but are coordinately configured in the PFC. The projection neurons gradiently occupied different territories in the PFC aligning with their wiring patterns. Importantly, they show higher co-projection probability to the downstream nuclei with reciprocal circuit connections. Moreover, we integrated projectomic atlas with their distinct spectrum of neurotransmitter/neuropeptide and the receptors-related gene profiles and depicted PFC neural signal transmission network. By which, we uncovered potential mechanisms underlying the complexity and specificity of neural transmission. Finally, leveraging machine learning, we predicted neuron projections with high accuracy by combining gene profiles and spatial information. As a proof of concept, we used this model to predict projections of fear recall engram neurons. This study facilitates our understanding of brain multi-modal network and neural computation.",

      "title": "Age-Related Changes to Olivocochlear Efferent Neurons in Mice with Pathological Hearing",
      "content": "One of the fundamental features of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is difficulty discriminating speech signals from background noise. In addition to protecting the ear from acoustic trauma, olivocochlear (OC) efferent neurons participate in signal discrimination by virtue of their inhibitory actions on auditory nerve firing. Given the time course of peripheral degeneration in ARHL, we sought to investigate the central degeneration of medial (MOC) and lateral (LOC) efferent neurons in mutant mice that exhibit genetic hearing loss or deafness at different ages. Tests of cochlear function were combined with anatomical and morphological quantification of changes to somatic number, morphology, and location of OC neurons. Neuronal tract tracing methods were employed to label OC neurons in 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old CBA/CaH mice with normal hearing; DBA/2J mice with progressive, high frequency hearing loss; and homozygous Shaker2 mice with congenital deafness. Deaf Shaker2-/- animals exhibited age-related atrophy and loss of MOCs, with contralateral MOCs more affected than ipsilateral MOCs, while LOCs were largely unaffected. No such OC degeneration was observed in DBA/2J mice, even after progressive elevation of low frequency auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) thresholds. Thus, OC efferent neurons can appear morphologically 'normal' in the complete absence of acoustic input in early life (as in deaf Shaker2-/- animals) and that the retention of these neurons is not affected by late onset high-frequency hearing loss observed in DBA/2J animals. Differential patterns of MOC neuron degeneration may affect functional plasticity of auditory brainstem feedback circuitry in ARHL.",

      "content": "Scene segmentation, a key step towards structured understanding of natural environments, entails a complementary set of computations. Instead of accessing these segmentation computations in isolation, we perceive the segregated object as a unified whole, but the neural basis supporting such a unitary percept remains unclear. We bridged this gap by showing a convergent coding scheme: an object-level additive code in the primary visual cortex, which serves as a spatial segmentation mask for the object. Across individual neurons, this code uniformly boosted their responses to the segmented object. In the population space, this code created an orthogonal representational geometry by perpendicularly displacing the neural manifold for image features, efficiently multiplexing both local and global information about the object. Computational modeling further revealed the utility and optimality of this convergent coding scheme, which effectively isolates objects in cluttered environments and in turn unclutters downstream object representations. Our findings reveal the computational logic of visual segmentation and call for a revision of the visual cortical hierarchy.",
