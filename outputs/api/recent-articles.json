      "title": "Molecular and Cellular Underpinnings of Spatial Heterogeneity in Fetal Cortical Folding",
      "content": "Cortical folding is a defining feature of human brain development, yet the molecular and cellular mechanisms that produce regionally specific cortical folding remain incompletely understood. Here we combined high-resolution in-utero T2-weighted and diffusion MRI atlases (23-38 weeks of gestational age) with prenatal transcriptomic profiles to map regional macrostructural and microstructural features of cortical folding to underlying gene expression. We found genes whose expression patterns correlated with cortical curvature were enriched for neurogenesis, progenitor proliferation and radial glia guided neuronal migration, and localized to ventricular zone/subventricular zone progenitor cell subtypes, supporting for the protomap hypothesis of areal specification. By contrast, cortical microstructural markers-associated gene sets were implicated in myelination, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodeling, and mapped to astrocyte and endothelial cell programs. The microstructure-related gene expression peaked in the early postnatal period and remained high throughout childhood, while the curvature-associated gene expression reduced with age. Several of these cortical folding-related genes overlapped with autism spectrum disorder risk loci (e.g., SCN2A, STXBP1, DVL3). Collectively, these cross-modal findings outline a sequential developmental architecture--early progenitor driven patterning followed by myelin and extracellular matrix consolidation. In addition, we released a high-resolution fetal labeling atlas to facilitate further imaging-genetic studies of early cortical development.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Pain-regulation circuitry as a predictor of chronic pain phenotypes",
      "content": "Background: Chronic pain is a multidimensional condition in which emotional distress, negative expectations, and functional impairment signal greater disease severity. Standard diagnostic categories often fail to capture clinically meaningful heterogeneity, highlighting the need for mechanistic phenotyping. Methods: We studied 159 individuals with fibromyalgia or chronic low back pain and 72 healthy controls. Participants completed a cue-based expectation task with calibrated thermal stimuli. Principal component and cluster analyses were used to derive high and low pain, disability, and affective distress (PDA) phenotypes. Groups were compared on expectation-induced pain modulation (EIPM) and resting state connectivity of periaqueductal gray (PAG) subregions. Stepwise machine learning models evaluated whether clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging features could classify PDA phenotypes. Results: High PDA patients exhibited impaired pain modulation when positive expectations were violated, particularly under low-threat cues (P<0.05), and reported higher catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and medication use than low PDA patients. Resting-state analyses revealed more negative dorsolateral/lateral PAG to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex coupling in the high PDA group. Machine learning models classified PDA subtypes above chance, with maximal accuracy when PAG connectivity was combined with clinical and behavioral measures. Conclusions: Severe chronic pain characterized by high emotional distress, disability, and pain is associated with disrupted expectation driven modulation and altered PAG connectivity. Integrating symptom profiles with neural and behavioral markers provides a biologically informed framework for identifying phenotypes with distinct treatment needs. These results suggest that expectation-related pain regulation and midbrain circuitry represent complementary mechanistic targets for precision interventions in chronic pain.",

      "content": "Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC) has been proposed as an elegant neural mechanism for representing sequential items in memory, coordinating distant brain regions, and parsing complex sensory inputs. Yet, whether PAC carries content-specific, behaviorally meaningful information has not been demonstrated to date. Here, using human intracranial recordings before, during and after an audio-visual associative learning task, we show that PAC is an information-coding mechanism. PAC strength in cortico-hippocampal networks increased linearly during learning and remained significantly stronger post vs. pre-learning. More importantly, PAC comodulograms carried stimulus- and association-specific information: auditory items were decodable in auditory cortex before learning based on PAC features, while learned associations were classified across hippocampo-temporo-frontal networks during and after learning. Post-learning brain decoding confusion matrices closely mirrored behavioral confusion matrices, and PAC patterns were independent of low-level stimulus features. These findings suggest that PAC is an endogenously generated marker that supports perception and associative learning in the human brain.",

      "content": "Overarching conceptualizations propose a critical role of the default mode network (DMN) in self-referential mental time travel, particularly in autobiographical memory retrieval and episodic future thinking, and internal (intrinsic) emotion generation and regulation. However, these conceptualizations have not been directly evaluated. Against this background, the present fMRI study aimed to identify both shared and distinct neural systems underlying autobiographical episodic processing across different temporal contexts - specifically, episodic memory retrieval (EMR) and episodic future thinking (EFT) - and to examine how these systems interact with affective experiences, including valence and arousal. Our findings demonstrated the central role of the DMN - encompassing the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and medial temporal lobe (MTL) - in both EMR and EFT. Importantly, we identified a functional dissociation along both valence and temporal dimensions: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was more strongly associated with positive experiences and simulations, whereas the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was consistently engaged during the processing of negative affect across past and future contexts. Moreover, representational similarity and parametric analyses indicated that the hippocampus supports differential processing of valence and arousal across temporal domains. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence for the involvement of cortical midline core DMN systems in autobiographical processing across time and suggest overlapping and distinct systems for the integration of emotional experiences across mental time travel.",

      "title": "A reproducible human brain tissue model to study physiological and disease-associated microglia phenotypes",
      "content": "Stem-cell-based in vitro models offer promising potential to elucidate human brain cell functions and interactions under physiological and pathological conditions. However, harnessing this potential is impaired by low reproducibility, maturity, or cell-type diversity of existing models. Especially, prolonged incorporation of mature microglia and studies of neuroinflammation have proven challenging. Here, we developed a 3D cortical brain tissue model (3BTM) containing neurons, astrocytes, and microglia with high reproducibility, maturity, and viability. 3BTMs show morphological, functional, and proteomic maturation of all cell types, leading to high similarity to their in vivo counterparts. Incorporated microglia survive for over 6 months and display mature morphology, functions, and gene expression. Importantly, when engineered to model Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, 3BTMs recapitulate key disease hallmarks including amyloid deposition, increased phospho-Tau levels, and neuroinflammation, with microglia shifting their transcriptional landscape to disease-relevant signatures. Treatment of AD 3BTMs with anti-A{beta} immunotherapy cleared deposits and largely reversed disease signatures in glia. Together, our model offers unprecedented possibilities for studying physiological and pathological states of human brain tissue and translational applications.",

      "content": "Mutations in SLC6A1 encoding GABA transporter 1 are a leading monogenic cause of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, severe neurodevelopmental disorders lacking effective treatments. We previously demonstrated that 4-phenylbutyrate restored molecular and functional deficits, and reduced seizures in a Slc6a1 loss-of-function mouse, motivating a promising ongoing clinical trial. Here, we show this mouse exhibits accumulation of extracellular GABA, impaired neurotransmission, and reduced GABA uptake; and demonstrate that 4-phenylbutyrate rescues these abnormalities.",

      "title": "Medial Olivocochlear Activity Modulates Central Auditory Synapse Structure and Function",
      "content": "In many mammals, the auditory system is immature at birth and undergoes activity-dependent refinement. The medial olivocochlear system (MOC) contributes to the maturation of central auditory connectivity by shaping spontaneous activity in the developing inner ear. Although altered MOC activity has been linked to electrical and synaptic dysfunctions in different central auditory nuclei, an in-depth analysis of the same synapse under conditions of absent versus enhanced MOC activity is lacking. In this work, we set out a physiological and structural analysis of the calyx of Held and the principal neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (CH-MNTB) synapse at postnatal days 12-14 in three mouse models of either sex: wild-type (WT), 9 knock-in (9KI; with enhanced MOC activity), and 9 knock-out (9KO; which lacks MOC activity). Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices revealed a reduced synaptic strength efficacy in 9KI compared to WT, including smaller excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes, stronger short-term depression during repetitive stimulation and a decrease readily releasable pool size. In contrast, 9KO mice showed minimal synaptic differences relative to WT. Serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) reconstructions demonstrated morphological alterations of the CH in both MOC-manipulated mouse models. However, 9KI mice exhibited the largest deviations, including fewer morphologically complex CHs and increased poly-innervation of MNTB cells. These results indicate that transient, well-regulated efferent control of cochlear activity is crucial for establishing accurate central auditory connectivity. Moreover, the enhancement of MOC activity drives more pronounced developmental changes in brainstem auditory circuitry than its absence.",

      "title": "Replication Challenges in Linking Personality to Resting-State Functional Connectomics",
      "content": "An increasing number of studies are currently focusing on \"personality neuroscience\", a term labeling the research aimed at neuroimaging correlates of inter-individual temperament and character variability. Among other methods, a graph theoretical analysis of the functional connectivity in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data was applied in a study by Gao et al (2013), reporting novel functional connectivity correlates of personality traits. The current paper presents an independent validation of the results of this study and discusses the related challenges, including extension of the original statistical methods in order to illustrate the effect of the multiple comparison problem. Five personality dimensions were obtained using the revised \"Big Five\" Personality Inventory, including scores of Extraversion and Neuroticism covered in the original paper. Using a larger sample (84 subjects) with power over eighty percent, we failed to replicate any of the nine specific neuroimaging correlates of personality presented by Gao et al. While acknowledging differences in the experimental procedures, we discuss that the lack of replication might be caused by the relatively liberal control of false positives in the original study. Indeed, the original testing scheme leads to an expected count of about 10 false positive observations among all tests; applying this scheme to our data we observed a similar number of positive tests, albeit for different relations. No significant correlations were found in our data when standard family-wise error control was applied. These results illustrate the importance of combining exploration with independent validation, use of large datasets, as well as appropriate control of multiple comparison problem in order to prevent false alarms in research into neurological substrates of personality differences. Of course, our findings to disprove the existence of link between personality and brain's intrinsic functional architecture; but rather suggest such link might be even more subtle and elusive than previously reported.",

      "title": "Modular Integration of Auditory Instructions and Visual Cues into the Cortical Reach Network",
      "content": "Humans depend on the brain's ability to integrate multisensory cues for 'top-down' motor strategies with 'bottom-up' stimulus attributes. For example, one can be verbally instructed to use different grasp strategies to acquire an object with the same visual attributes. Conversely, failure to integrate such cues, i.e., following brain damage, could greatly impair goal-directed behavior. To understand how such cues are mapped onto action plans, we employed an event-related fMRI paradigm in which visual and auditory cues were presented successively in randomized order. Twelve participants viewed a physical cube presented to their left or right (bottom-up sensory input) and were verbally instructed to perform a horizontal or vertical grip (top-down motor strategy). To map brain activity through the task, we employed univariate activation analysis, region-of-interest (ROI) analysis, graph-theory analysis (GTA) based connectivity analyses, and used GTA features to decode cue-order information. Univariate voxel-wise and ROI analysis confirmed order-dependent activation of visual and auditory cortex, followed by mounting parietofrontal activation as cues accumulated for action. GTA analysis revealed two significant subnetworks (modules): one spanning Occipital-Parietal-Somatomotor Cortex (likely for integrating visual object attributes into the reach plan) and the other spanning Temporal-Frontal-Somatomotor Cortex (likely for integrating instructions into the grasp plan). Cue order influenced modularity, i.e., the module corresponding to the first cue module tended to dominate contralateral motor cortex. A classification model decoded cue order, based primarily on modularity. Local (within module) network hubs occupied traditional cortical action areas and were order-independent, whereas global (between modules) network hubs were more scattered and order-dependent. These results show that sensorimotor integration is modular, depending on cue modality, functional relevance of the cue, and presentation order. The occipital-parietal / temporal-frontal modularity observed here suggests that the brain can flexibly map sensory inputs through different cortical pathways to achieve effective multisensory-motor integration.",
