      "title": "Neuroprotective Parkinson's Disease Therapeutic: Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoflower Treatments Alleviate Pathological Cell Stress",
      "content": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is triggered by irreversible degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain, hypothalamus, and thalamus. Although the underlying molecular etiology of these pathological processes remains unclear, progressive aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) and mitochondrial dysfunction are two expected mechanisms implicated in neuronal degeneration. Accumulating evidence indicates that transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoflowers (NFs), a novel class of nanomaterials, can restore mitochondrial health by the activation of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, therapeutic potential of TMD NFs in PD remains unclear. The current study investigates the neuroprotective properties of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoflowers (NFs) in neurons and astrocytes exposed to a-syn aggregates. It was found that MoS2 and MoSe2 suppressed a-syn-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum, and upregulated autophagy and exocytosis of a-syn fibrils. TMD NFs also reversed a-syn-induced damage of cell mitochondria, simultaneously stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis. As a result, a drastic decrease in ROS levels in both neurons and astrocytes was observed. These results show that MoS2 or MoSe2 NFs could fully rescue neurons and astrocytes from the cytotoxic effects of a-syn fibrils. Neuroprotective properties of these novel nanomaterials were further explored in Caenorhabditis elegans that overexpress a-syn. Nematodes that received NFs experienced a drastic reduction in the amount of aggregated a-syn which resulted in a significant increase in C. elegans lifespan. These findings indicated that MoS2 or MoSe2 NFs could be used as novel therapeutic to decelerate the progression of PD.",

      "title": "Reward-reset interval timing drives patch foraging decisions through neural state transitions in dorsomedial striatum",
      "content": "Activities with diminishing returns pose a unique computational problem for the brain, requiring a combination of outcome evaluation and temporal tracking. Deciding the right time to stop one pursuit and move to alternatives is an important part of effective time management, yet it is unknown how the decision-making circuits of the brain determine the moment to switch. The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) mediates both goal-directed decision-making and interval timing, two functions that converge during patch foraging, where animals must time when to exit patches to maximize reward rates. We recorded extracellular activity from neurons in DMS while freely moving mice performed a patch-foraging task. Mice employed a 'reward-reset' strategy, primarily basing their exit decisions on the time since the last reward, but with the patch residence time and environmental reward-rate context also contributing to the intended time of departure. Individual neurons in DMS underwent discrete firing rate transitions at characteristic delays following each reward. These transition delays were distributed across the population, creating a cumulative signal that reached a threshold coinciding with patch exit. This population activity pattern spanned the intended reward-to-exit interval, compressing or expanding in accordance with patch residence time and changing environmental conditions. Fiber photometry recordings revealed phasic dopamine signals in DMS encoding reward prediction errors that reflected the declining reward probability over time. Our results provide insights into how DMS integrates its dual roles in timing and action selection to guide time investment strategies during foraging.",

      "title": "Data-driven burst shape analysis for functional phenotyping of neuronal cultures",
      "content": "Cultures of neurons in vitro are instrumental for studying network dynamics in normal and pathological conditions. Mature networks typically exhibit network bursting activity, which has traditionally been quantified by simplified features such as inter-burst intervals and burst durations. While these features advanced the understanding of development, disease phenotypes, and drug effects, they overlook the temporal structure of activity within bursts. Here, we developed a comprehensive framework to quantify burst shapes, the time course of network firing during bursts. Applying this approach to four datasets, including rodent- and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cultures, we show that burst shapes contain rich information about the underlying network dynamics. We quantify this information by using traditional and shape features to classify the recording conditions (types of genetic disorder, presence of pharmacological agents) and demonstrate that shapes significantly increase classification accuracy. We provide a pipeline for burst shape characterization, including simplified features that capture most of the shape information, establishing burst shape as a robust and biologically meaningful marker for functional phenotyping in disease modeling and drug screening.",
