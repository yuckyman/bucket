      "title": "Decoupling model descriptions from execution: a modular paradigm for extensible neurosimulation with EDEN",
      "content": "Computational-neuroscience simulators have traditionally been constrained by tightly coupled simulation engines and modeling languages, limiting their flexibility and scalability. Retrofitting these platforms to accommodate new backends is often costly, and sharing models across simulators remains cumbersome. This paper puts forward an alternative approach based on the EDEN neural simulator, which introduces a modular stack that decouples abstract model descriptions from execution. This architecture enhances flexibility and extensibility by enabling seamless integration of multiple backends, including hardware accelerators, without extensive reprogramming. Through the use of NeuroML, simulation developers can focus on high-performance execution, while model users benefit from improved portability without the need to implement custom simulation engines. Additionally, the proposed method for incorporating arbitrary simulation platforms\u2014from model-optimized code kernels to custom hardware devices\u2014as backends offers a more sustainable and adaptable framework for the computational-neuroscience community. The effectiveness of EDEN's approach is demonstrated by integrating two distinct backends: flexHH, an FPGA-based accelerator for extended Hodgkin-Huxley networks, and SpiNNaker, the well-known, neuromorphic platform for large-scale spiking neural networks. Experimental results show that EDEN integrates the different backends with minimal effort while maintaining competitive performance, reaffirming it as a robust, extensible platform that advances the design paradigm for neural simulators by achieving high generality, performance, and usability.",

      "content": "IntroductionEnhancing the command capacity of motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains a significant challenge in neuroinformatics, especially for real-world assistive applications. This study explores a multiclass BCI system designed to classify multiple MI tasks using a low-cost EEG device.MethodsA BCI system was developed to classify six mental states: resting state, left and right hand movement imagery, tongue movement, and left and right lateral bending, using EEG data collected with the Emotiv EPOC X headset. Seven participants underwent a body awareness training protocol integrating mindfulness and physical exercises to improve MI performance. Machine learning techniques were applied to extract discriminative features from the EEG signals.ResultsPost-training assessments indicated modest improvements in participants' MI proficiency. However, classification performance was limited due to inter- and intra-subject signal variability and the technical constraints of the consumer-grade EEG hardware.DiscussionThese findings highlight the value of combining user training with MI-based BCIs and the need to optimize signal quality for reliable performance. The results support the feasibility of scalable, multiclass MI paradigms in low-cost, user-centered neurotechnology applications, while pointing to critical areas for future system enhancement.",

      "title": "Improving EEG classification of alcoholic and control subjects using DWT-CNN-BiGRU with various noise filtering techniques",
      "content": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal analysis plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring alcoholism, where accurate classification of individuals into alcoholic and control groups is essential. However, the inherent noise and complexity of EEG signals pose significant challenges. This study investigates the impact of three signal denoising techniques' Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Non EEG signal classification performance. The motivation behind this study is to identify the most effective preprocessing method for enhancing deep learning model performance in this domain. A novel DWT-CNN-BiGRU model is proposed, which leverages CNN layers for spatial feature extraction and BiGRU layers for capturing temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that the DWT-based approach, combined with standard scaling, achieves the highest accuracy of 94%, with a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.95, and an F1-score of 0.94. Compared to the baseline DWT-CNN-BiLSTM model, the proposed method provides a modest yet meaningful improvement of approximately 17% in classification accuracy. These findings highlight the superiority of DWT as a preprocessing method and validate the proposed model's effectiveness for EEG-based classification, contributing to the development of more reliable medical diagnostic tools.",
