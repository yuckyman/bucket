      "title": "Neurobehavioral concomitants of alcohol use in older healthy adults",
      "content": "Few laboratory studies permitting granular analyses of alcohol use on neurobehavioral processes in older adults have been reported. This study, reporting baseline data from an on-going longitudinal project, seeks to address this gap. Toward that end, working memory (WM) processes were targeted using the continuous recognition version of the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). Healthy male and female drinkers aged 65\u201380 years completed self-report measures of substance use, negative affect and demographics prior to testing. Drinking patterns were quantified on the basis of typical standard drinks/day (D/D). Behavioral data were obtained in a two-button forced choice paradigm. Neurophysiological data were obtained for each stimulus presentation with analyses focusing on a mid-frontal negative shift occurring \u223c 300\u2013500 ms post stimulus (FN400) and a posterior positive shift occurring \u223c 550\u2013800 ms after stimulus presentation (LPC). To constrain the models, for the behavioral analyses correlations between D/D, measures of negative affect, stimulus condition (\u201cnew,\u201d \u201cidentical,\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d) and performance were conducted. They indicated that only accuracy in labeling \u201cnew\u201d items was related to D/D. Subsequent least squares regression revealed that D/D was inversely related to accuracy for new items. In a sensitivity analysis removing THC users, the D/D effect was retained. Correlations incorporating mean amplitudes for the FN400 and LPC failed to reveal identifiable patterns. Consequently, separate mixed models (e.g., stimulus condition) for FN400 and LPC were conducted. D/D was not predictive of the FN400 for any stimulus condition. It was negatively related to the LPC mean amplitude. In post-hoc analyses, the effect was most notable for \u201cnew\u201d stimuli. After removing THC users, the magnitude and direction of the D/D effect was retained, although the p value fell short of significance. Primary models failed to reveal sex main or interaction effects. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses justify their continued study. These data lend preliminary support for the hypothesis that sustained drinking among older adults may negatively impact neurobehavioral processes. They are also consistent with expectations that alcohol effects may be modest and constrained by specific process. Importantly, these outcomes will be expanded through on-going longitudinal study, extending investigation to study of alcohol-related cognitive decline.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "A computational framework combining neuronal dynamics and evolutionary game theory for network-level synaptic interactions",
      "content": "Objective. In this study, we present a novel computational framework that combines the Hindmarsh\u2013Rose (HR) neuronal model with evolutionary game theory on networks to simulate and interpret synaptic-level interactions within neuronal populations. Our approach preserves the features of the HR model\u2014capable of generating both spiking and bursting dynamics\u2014while integrating game-theoretic principles that govern the balance between emulative and non-emulative behaviors across neurons. Approach. Neurons were modeled as strategic agents whose interactions evolve according to game-theoretic principles, allowing us to capture emergent network dynamics beyond classical electrophysiological analyses. A key innovation of our work is the formulation of a parameter estimation method based on adaptive observers, which enables the recovery of game-theoretic parameters solely from partial state observations. The proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to recover hidden parameters and accurately predict system behavior under diverse conditions. Main results. By applying the devised approach to synthetic datasets mimicking real electrophysiological recordings, we highlight its applicability in distinguishing neuronal populations based on their strategic interactions. In this context, the model is shown to faithfully reproduce both spiking and bursting behaviors, capturing the diverse electrophysiological patterns observed in in vitro experimental settings. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this model in experimental data analysis by suggesting that the estimated parameters may serve as discriminative markers for different neuronal types and structural characteristics. Significance. The integration of dynamical systems theory, game-theoretic modeling, and adaptive estimation provides a robust quantitative tool for investigating complex neuronal network dynamics. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of the method in parameter estimation, reinforcing its value for systematic analysis of synaptic interactions and advancing our understanding of neuronal network dynamics.",

      "title": "Patient-specific long-term seizure prediction via multi-model classification",
      "content": "Objective. Most existing seizure prediction approaches rely on cohort-based models or assume a single model suffices per patient, overlooking clinical and electrophysiological variability across seizures. This study aims to overcome these limitations by introducing a subject-specific seizure prediction framework that models intra-subject heterogeneity by identifying and clustering seizure-specific preictal patterns using long-term intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings collected over a one to two week duration. Approach: Absolute, relative, and ratio power spectral density features are extracted from twelve frequency bands, and the minimum uncertainty and sample elimination algorithm is used for unsupervised feature selection on a per-seizure basis. Weighted aggregation is then applied to form seizure-specific feature sets. Seizures are grouped into clusters based on feature similarity, and separate classifiers are trained for each cluster. Model predictions are combined using a grid optimized k-of-N voting strategy. Evaluation is conducted on long-term iEEG recordings from ten patients using cross-validation across seizure-containing sessions. Main results. When clustering is applied, the mean sensitivity across subjects is improved from 89.17% to 98.54%, while the mean FPR is reduced from 1.15/day to 0.62/day. Additionally, the median number of features required per subject decreased from 22 to 14, reflecting a 36.4% reduction in model complexity. Finally, in 72.5% of subject-folds, the number of algorithm-identified clusters equaled or exceeded the clinically annotated seizure types, with a linear trend indicating latent electrophysiological variability beyond clinical labels. Significance. These findings highlight the value of modeling seizure diversity within individuals and support the development of more personalized and interpretable seizure forecasting systems.",
