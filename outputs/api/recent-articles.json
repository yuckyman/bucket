      "title": "The expression level of CACNA1C-encoded CaV1.2 is a tipping point between promotion and inhibition of dendritic growth in neurons",
      "content": "The CACNA1C gene encodes the CaV1.2 L-type voltage-gated calcium channel, which plays a crucial role in neuronal signaling. CACNA1C is a risk gene for psychiatric conditions involving disruption of neuronal connectivity such as schizophrenia, autism, and bipolar disorders. While genomic studies are consistently reinforcing the notion of CACNA1C as an important locus related to these diseases, the role of CaV1.2 channels in determining neuronal architecture is incompletely understood. Several studies pinpoint the L-type current (ICaL) as regulator of dendritic arborization development. ICaL lays upstream of competing cellular mechanisms leading to both inhibition and promotion of dendritic growth. How signal selectivity is achieved remains an open question. Here, we report that ICaL -dependent dendritic development of murine cultured hippocampal neurons relies on CaV1.2 and is determined by an equilibrium between the level of CaV1.2 protein expression and ICaL activity. Indeed, increasing ICaL enhances dendritic complexity only when CaV1.2 expression level is reduced. In contrast, when channel levels are at baseline, the CaV1.2-dependent growing signal is overcome by the elevation of the dendritic growth inhibiting CaMKII signaling beyond basal conditions. These findings suggest that CaV1.2 expression level acts as a molecular switch between dendritic growing and inhibiting signals. Consequently, altered CaV1.2 expression during early development may alter neuronal structure, potentially impairing neural network formation and increasing susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Development of anterior hippocampal integration underlies the protracted emergence of cognitive map formation and generalization",
      "content": "Flexible memory depends on integrating experiences across time and space into cognitive maps[&mdash;]holistic representations that support flexible navigation and generalization. Although the anterior hippocampus is thought to support integration across broad spatiotemporal scales, it matures relatively late, suggesting that its functional development may be key to mature cognitive mapping. Here, we show that anterior hippocampal integration, indexed by temporal autocorrelation of fMRI activation, undergoes prolonged development and predicts age-related improvements in spatial memory. In a large resting-state sample (N=382; aged 5-34 years), temporal autocorrelation increased with age in anterior but not posterior hippocampus. We replicated this anterior pattern in an independent, task-based sample (N=85; aged 6-12 years and adults). Moreover, we linked hippocampal integration to behavior using a spatial navigation task that required participants to adapt to rotations of a virtual environment across learning runs as well as generalize learned cognitive maps when new objects were introduced. Children exhibited lower anterior autocorrelation and re-learned object positions when the environment changed. In adolescents, increasing anterior hippocampal autocorrelation was accompanied by gradual behavioral improvements in locating objects in the face of environmental change. Adults showed the greatest anterior hippocampal autocorrelation, which uniquely supported accurate spatial memory performance through efficient path navigation in the changing environment. These findings identify spatiotemporal integration in anterior hippocampus as a key mechanism underlying the developmental shift from local representation of individual positions in an environment to formation of flexible cognitive maps that are robust and generalizable in the face of environmental change.",

      "title": "Differences in the co-distribution of the Cannabinoid Receptor-1, FAAH, and MAGL in the human and mouse brain could be limiting clinical translation of endocannabinoid outcomes in mouse models of Alzheimer disease.",
      "content": "Endocannabinoid system (ECS) outcomes in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD) do not always align with the clinical disease course. We compared the distribution of the Cannabinoid Receptor-1 (CB1R) and the enzymes, FAAH and MAGL, in autopsy AD brain samples as well as in the J20 (hAPPSwe/Ind) mouse model of AD. Both sources revealed several anti-CB1R immunoreactive species, e.g. one at 47-kDa (corresponding to the protein-coding sequence) and a reported putative splice variant at 37 kDa. We did not observe any changes in the mean expression in CB1R, FAAH or MAGL in the human samples, but did observe sex- and genotype-specific changes in the mouse brain. Regression analysis revealed strong sex- and APOE epsilon4-dependent associations among the CB1Rs as well as between CB1Rs and MAGL (but not FAAH) in human cortical (but not hippocampal) samples. In the J20 mouse, associations between CB1Rs were limited to hippocampal samples, whereas associations between CB1R and both MAGL and FAAH were observed in the cortex. A diagnosis of AD disrupted any associations in the human dataset, whereas in several instances, the associations were enhanced by the hAPPSwe/Ind transgene. This inferred species-dependent regulation of the ECS could impact the clinical translational of ECS outcomes in preclinical models of AD pathology.",

      "title": "An Amygdalar Oscillatory Switch Governs Valence Assignment",
      "content": "Reward pursuit and punishment avoidance are among the most fundamental behaviors necessary for survival. The binary valuation of an experience as either positive or negative - valence assignment - is imperative for successful navigation of a regularly updating environment. Mounting evidence highlights the critical role of valence responsive basolateral amygdala (BLA) ensembles in coding valence information. However, how BLA ensembles are recruited to drive real-time valence assignment remains elusive. Here, we show locus coeruleus (LC)-derived norepinephrine coordinates this neural computational process via modulatory control over network-organizing BLA parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneuron activity. Specifically, optogenetic activation of LC to BLA noradrenergic terminals (LC-BLANE) drives real-time negative valence assignment and suppression of BLA fast gamma oscillatory activity via BLA interneuronal alpha1a adrenergic receptor signaling. Conversely, positive valence assignment also requires BLA PV interneuron activity but is associated with an enhancement of local fast gamma power. Together, these converging data highlight a PV-driven amygdalar oscillatory switch that governs valence assignment.",

      "title": "Noradrenergic neuromodulation of cholecystokinin interneurons in the basolateral amygdala alters rhythmic activity and restrains fear memory",
      "content": "Norepinephrine (NE) release in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) during emotional arousal plays an essential role in the processing of fear. However, the cell type-specific NE neuromodulation of the fear circuit in the BLA has not been fully resolved. We reported previously a facilitation of fear memory by Gq-coupled receptor induction of repetitive bursting in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and suppression of gamma oscillations in the BLA. Here, using patch clamp recordings, Cre-dependent DLX-driven intersectional targeting, and genetic manipulations, we demonstrate that NE also activates cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing interneurons to generate synchronized trains of rhythmic CB1-sensitive IPSCs in BLA principal neurons via Gq-coupled 1A adrenoreceptor activation. The Gq-dependent mechanism in CCK interneurons is generalizable to chemogenetic Gq manipulation and Gq-coupled 5-HT2C serotoninergic receptor activation. We next tested the role of Gq neuromodulation of CCK interneurons in the regulation of BLA network activity associated with the behavioral expression of fear learning by rescued expression of 1A adrenoreceptors or chemogenetic Gq activation selectively in BLA CCK interneurons in a global 1A adrenoreceptor knockout mouse. Restoration of the rhythmic inhibitory synaptic activity via rescue of Gq-coupled receptor signaling in CCK interneurons enhanced LFP theta power in the BLA in vivo and decreased fear memory acquisition and recall. These data indicate an inhibitory role for CCK interneuron Gq signaling in fear learning via activation of patterned inhibitory synaptic input to principal neurons and enhanced theta oscillations in the BLA, and reveal a G protein-dependent, receptor-nonselective neuromodulatory mechanism in the BLA that regulates network and behavioral states.",

      "content": "Parenting behavior emerges from hormonally sensitive circuits, but how distinct circuit components are affected by, and contribute to, sex and state dependent changes in infant caregiving remains unclear. Using cell type-specific approaches, we characterized two circuit nodes that are differentially configured by hormones to modulate infant-evoked behavior. An excitatory neuronal population in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus is only active in lactating mothers, increases virgin female caregiving when artificially stimulated and confers oxytocin sensitivity in mothers through a prolactin STAT5b pathway. These neurons function upstream of another preoptic area population involved in male and female parenting, thus boosting caregiving by mothers. By contrast, androgen signaling in the latter preoptic population reshapes their intrinsic properties to promote pup-directed aggression, revealing cell type-specific tuning of social behavior circuits.",

      "title": "Cross-species evidence for the refinement of intrinsic neural timescales supporting executive system maturation through adolescence",
      "content": "Brain functional, structural, and neurochemical maturation has been found to support the specialization of executive systems through adolescence that will lead to adult level processing. Importantly, animal models and initial EEG studies in humans indicate developmental improvements in neural processing of complex information that would be evident in changes in temporal dynamics, which are not well-understood. Intrinsic neural timescales (INTs), or the temporal windows over which neural populations integrate inputs, have been proposed to reflect circuit-level properties such as excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) balance, myelination, and functional properties supporting complex information processing such as in executive functioning. Here, we used a multimodal, cross-species approach to investigate how INTs develop across adolescence to support cognitive specialization. In parallel analyses using a large longitudinal human EEG cohort, adolescent intracranial sEEG recordings, and macaque local field potentials, we observed robust reductions in INTs through adolescence, particularly in frontal and parietal association cortices. These developmental reductions were shaped by local circuit physiology, as evidenced by associations between shorter INTs and both lower aperiodic exponents, indicative of increased E/I balance, and reduced spectral offsets, suggesting lower aggregate spiking. We also found structural contributions via developmental interactions between age and deep layer intracortical myelination which predicted shorter INTs, suggesting that long-range circuitry may play a key role in shaping spontaneous temporal dynamics. Functionally, shorter INTs in adolescence were linked to improved working memory accuracy and reduced response time variability, indicating a behavioral advantage of refined temporal integration windows through development. Together, these findings establish INTs as a conserved, biologically grounded signature of adolescent brain maturation, providing a mechanistic framework for how structural and physiological refinements reorganize temporal processing to support increasingly efficient cognitive function.",

      "title": "Loss of noradrenergic Fkbp5 disrupts social behavior and norepinephrine dynamics in the basolateral amygdala",
      "content": "Social dysfunction is common in depression and varies with stress exposure and genetic risk. The current study identifies a cell-type specific role for Fkbp5, a glucocorticoid receptor co-chaperone, in noradrenergic neurons engaged during social stress. Acute social stress upregulated Fkbp5 in the locus coeruleus (LC), whereas repeated exposure attenuated this effect. Noradrenergic Fkbp5 deletion (Fkbp5Nat) increased pro-social behavior exclusively in male mice. In the basolateral amygdala (BLA), social interaction reduced norepinephrine (NE) turnover in wild-type but not Fkbp5Nat mice. Consistently, proteomics revealed mitochondrial/energy and synapse-related remodeling in BLA neurons. Miniscope imaging showed that behavior-locked NE transients in BLA were selectively blunted in Fkbp5Nat mice during interaction with outbred CD1 conspecifics, while same-strain C57BL/6N encounters preserved NE dynamics. Together, this study indicates that Fkbp5 tunes LC-BLA output to social salience in a sex- and context-dependent manner, suggesting a circuit-specific route to normalize social salience without broadly suppressing noradrenergic function.",

      "title": "A Causal Role for the Hippocampus in Gating Rapid Motor Memory Consolidation",
      "content": "How humans learn new skills is a fundamental aspect of behavior. Rapid memory consolidation during brief rests is crucial, but the causal role of the hippocampus remains unclear. Here, we used personalized transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) to non-invasively modulate the hippocampus. We found that hippocampal neuromodulation fundamentally alters how a skill is learned. Compared to sham stimulation, TUS shifted performance gains from rest periods (offline consolidation) to active practice (online learning). Paradoxically, this manipulation not only reshaped the learning process but also boosted overall performance by unmasking a latent and highly efficient online learning pathway, leading to superior skill retention 24 hours later. These findings provide causal evidence that the hippocampus acts as a gating mechanism, governing a key trade-off between online and offline learning pathways. Our work demonstrates that non-invasive deep brain modulation can causally alter the balance between competing memory systems, opening new avenues to optimize human performance.",

      "title": "Orientation-tuned surround suppression exhibits a unique laminar signature in human primary visual cortex",
      "content": "Spatial context modifies visual perception by enhancing novel and salient features over spatially redundant features in the underlying neural code of primary visual cortex (V1). Although multiple intracortical pathways contribute to contextual modulation, their specific contributions to different types of contextual modulation are not fully understood. Leveraging the distinct laminar connectivity patterns of feedforward, feedback, and lateral pathways, we used ultra-high-resolution fMRI (7T T$_2$*-weighted, 0.6 mm isotropic resolution) to infer their relative contributions to contextual modulation in V1 by analyzing blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal across cortical depth. Participants viewed sine-wave grating disks embedded in large surround gratings. Segmentation cues were introduced or removed by manipulating the relative phase and orientation of the surround gratings, yielding three contextual conditions and a surround-only condition to measure the effects of context in the absence of feedforward input. Our analysis isolated the effects of orientation-tuned surround suppression (OTSS) from orientation-independent border-induced modulation (BIM). The results show that BOLD laminar profiles differ by modulation type: BIM affected both deep and superficial voxels, while OTSS was absent in deep voxels. We also find that voxels at all depths are driven by spatial context in the absence of feedforward input, which accords with the discovery of contextually-driven neural responses in mammalian V1. These laminar differences likely reflect distinct contributions of feedback from higher-order visual areas and long-range lateral connections within V1. Our findings help to explicate the contributions of recurrent processing in visual contextual modulation and demonstrate the participation of lateral pathways in laminar-dependent BOLD fMRI.",

      "title": "Orbitofrontal noradrenaline mediates volatility-dependent adjustment of learning rate",
      "content": "Adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments requires flexible adjustment of learning speed to balance stability and flexibility. When outcomes are highly stochastic, learners must avoid over interpreting noise and update more slowly, whereas in volatile environments where contingencies change frequently, learning should accelerate to rapidly incorporate new evidence. Theories propose that internal estimates of uncertainty tune learning rates through neuromodulatory-dependent mechanisms. Here, we investigated how noradrenergic inputs from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) support adaptive learning under uncertainty. We show that rats performing a probabilistic reversal learning task exhibited behavior that was best explained by an adaptive reinforcement-learning model in which learning rates dynamically adjust according to estimated environmental volatility and stochasticity, outperforming standard fixed-rate models. Noradrenaline release in the OFC closely tracked trial-by-trial, model-derived volatility estimates around contingency changes. Disrupting LC[-&gt;]OFC noradrenergic inputs reproduced the model-predicted deficit in volatility-dependent adjustments of learning rate. Together, these findings identify OFC noradrenergic signaling as a key circuit mechanism for volatility-dependent modulation of learning rates during adaptive decision-making.",

      "title": "The Connectome Modulates Critical Brain Dynamics Across Local and Global Scales",
      "content": "Neuronal activity in the brain has been hypothesized to operate near criticality--a dynamical regime poised between order and disorder that maximizes information processing, adaptability, and dynamic range. While criticality has been extensively studied at local scales (within neuronal populations) and at global scales (across interacting brain regions), the interplay between these levels remains poorly understood. Here, we propose a multiscale computational framework that bridges local and global criticality within a single, mechanistic model. At the mesoscopic level, individual brain regions are represented by neural mass models tuned near the transition between asynchronous and synchronous regimes. These regions are then coupled via an empirically derived mouse connectome to investigate how structural connectivity shapes the emergence of large-scale coordination. We show that (i) local near critical dynamics for an isolated brain region can be faithfully reproduced within a mean-field model framework, (ii) local distance to criticality is modulated by long-range coupling, (iii) whole-brain simulations reveal non-linear gradients of timescales and heterogeneous shifts towards/away from local criticality, and (iv) global criticality, manifested in scale-free avalanche distributions and optimal functional connectivity, emerges when local populations are locally tuned near criticality and coupled within an optimal range. These results demonstrate that local and global criticality are dynamically intertwined but not directly aligned, and that their relationship depends on the underlying structural connectivity. Our multiscale modeling framework provides a tractable tool for generating testable hypotheses on how brain criticality co-arises across scales and how it may be modulated in health and disease.",

      "title": "Altered Motor Gamma Activity and Hemispheric Lateralisation Reflect Perinatal Maturity in Preterm Children during Motor Control",
      "content": "Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is associated with alterations in brain development and an increased likelihood of motor difficulties, with effects that often persist across childhood. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex is closely linked to motor execution and reflects the dynamic properties of cortical function, yet motor-related oscillations have rarely been examined directly in children born preterm. In this study, we investigated motor-induced gamma oscillations in school-aged children born preterm using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Eighteen children born preterm and nineteen age- and IQ-matched children born at full term (5 to 7 years old) completed a child-friendly dominant-hand finger movement task during recording with a child-customised MEG system. The preterm group exhibited significantly slower response times and approximately twenty-two per cent weaker contralateral gamma power compared with their full-term peers. They also showed reduced hemispheric lateralisation, indicating greater bilateral cortical engagement. Motor-related gamma power and lateralisation indices were positively associated with perinatal factors and motor performance scores. These findings suggest that attenuated gamma activity and altered lateralisation patterns in children born preterm may relate to delayed maturation of motor cortical circuits and variations in callosal development, potentially affecting interhemispheric communication and motor processing efficiency. This study provides new insight into the neurophysiological basis of motor development following preterm birth.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",
