      "title": "Spatiotemporally distinctive astrocytic and neuronal responses to repetitive intracortical microstimulation",
      "content": "Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as active modulators of neuronal synaptic transmission. Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) is widely used to manipulate neuronal activity, yet the accompanying astrocytic responses remain poorly characterized. Using dual-color in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously monitor neurons and astrocytes, we show that ICMS elicits astrocytic activation with spatiotemporal features that diverge from those of neurons. Astrocytes were recruited at stimulation intensities as low as 10A, thresholds sufficient to activate neurons, indicating that astrocytes robustly sense electrical perturbation. Unlike neurons, however, astrocytic responses were spatially heterogeneous and temporally variable across trials. At higher stimulation intensities (>=50A), astrocytic responsiveness, i.e., response peak amplitude, and number of responsive trials, progressively attenuated across repeated trials, in contrast to the stable and consistent neuronal responses. Although neuronally driven, astrocytes exhibited a distinct response profile under the same stimulation parameter, revealing a unique component of electrically evoked cortical activity that underscores the importance of incorporating glial physiology into future neuroprosthetic strategies.",

      "title": "Elliptical speech reveals the use of broad phonetic categories aids noise-degraded speech perception",
      "content": "Purpose: Speech perception requires that listeners classify sensory information into smaller groupings while also coping with noise that often corrupts the speech signal. The strength of categorization and speech-in-noise (SIN) abilities show stark individual differences. Some listeners perceive speech sounds in a gradient fashion, while others categorize in a discrete/binary manner, favoring fine acoustic details vs. a more abstract phonetic code, respectively. Prior work suggests SIN processing is (i) related to more gradient phonetic perception and (ii) varies with musical training. Method: To further probe relations between perceptual gradiency and noise-degraded listening, we measured phoneme categorization, SIN recognition (QuickSIN), and sentence recognition in listeners with varying musical backgrounds. Categorization was measured for vowels and stops using standard labeling tasks. Speech recognition and discrimination were assessed using 'elliptical speech' sentences that use featural substitutions which renders them meaningless under clean conditions but surprisingly improves their recognition under noise degradation. We hypothesized listeners who use broader perceptual equivalency classes in hearing elliptical speech would show better SIN perception, indicative of a more gradient listening strategy. Results: Listeners perceived elliptical sentences as sounding different than their intact counterparts in the clear but as the same under noise degradation. But this elliptical benefit varied with music background. Nonmusicians showed larger susceptibility and noise-related benefit of ellipses than musicians, consistent with the notion they used broader phonetic categories (i.e., more gradient listening). Elliptical speech perception was also associated with QuickSIN performance in both groups but in opposite ways. Conclusions: Use of broader categories was related to better SIN processing in nonmusicians but poorer SIN processing in musicians. Findings suggest listeners can use broader perceptual equivalence classes to deal with degraded listening situations but this depends critically on their auditory demographics. Nonmusicians might use broader phonetic categories to aid SIN perception while musicians might use narrower categories or otherwise similar speech contexts.",

      "title": "A plug-and-play ROI imaging module and deep-learning denoising framework extend three-photon microscopy to 1.7 mm depth",
      "content": "Three-photon microscopy (3PM) has extended optical imaging beyond the reach of two-photon microscopy (2PM), but its practical depth remains far below theoretical predictions because of low photon efficiency and severe noise contamination. Here we present an integrated hardware and software solution that addresses these limitations. We developed a plug-and-play region-of-interest (ROI) imaging module that selectively excites neuron-occupied regions to improve power efficiency and reduce photothermal stress. The module incorporates frame-partitioned accumulative (FPA) imaging for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) structural acquisition, automated neuron segmentation, and motion-robust registration for stable recordings. Complementing this, OptiCal is a cascaded deep-learning framework that removes mixed noise including periodic, motion-induced, and random components. Together, these innovations enable high-fidelity imaging to 1.7 mm depth, extending the practical limit of 3PM by about 400 m while maintaining low excitation power. Our results reveal reliable calcium activity and behavior-correlated dynamics in deep medial prefrontal cortex of awake mice.",

      "title": "Attention modulates EEG spectral activity across serial positions",
      "content": "Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity has been associated with attentional processes such as task-irrelevant stimulus suppression and orienting. The aim of this study was to understand how spectral activity evolves as words are presented in a word list learning task and as multiple components of attention are engaged under multitasking demands. We recorded scalp EEG in a delayed free-recall task in which participants encoded common noun word lists either under full attention (encoding only) or divided attention (simultaneous target detection task). In the target detection task, participants pressed a response button when a word was paired with a target-colored square but not for words paired with a distractor-colored square (cue condition). Activity in the high gamma frequencies (50-100 Hz) decreased while alpha activity (8-12 Hz) increased throughout word list presentation (i.e., across serial positions), consistent with prior work demonstrating effects of cognitive load on EEG spectral power. Divided attention attenuated this change in gamma power across the list. Cue condition modulated alpha activity evenly across serial positions, with consistently lower power during target trials than distractor trials. Our findings suggest that frequency-specific characteristics of processing during list encoding may reflect multiple components of attention that vary over different time scales. Gamma frequencies capture the interactive effects of cognitive load and dual-task demands, while alpha power separately reflects gradual increases in cognitive load and momentary orienting.",

      "title": "Neural representations of beliefs in a multi-dimensional inference task",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior requires maintaining and updating probabilistic beliefs about the world, yet how distributed brain circuits implement such computations remains unknown. We recorded from over 1,400 neurons across six brain regions in monkeys performing a multi-dimensional inference task requiring them to infer hidden rules through trial-and-error learning. Behavior was well-described by models based on Bayesian updating of beliefs over rule features. Neural representations of both observable variables (stimuli, rewards) and latent beliefs (rule preferences, confidence) were broadly distributed across hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, striatum, and inferior temporal cortex. Belief representations were present throughout all task periods but exhibited region- and epoch-specific dynamics. Critically, trial-to-trial changes in population activity reflected Bayesian belief updating: neural responses evolved according to the integration of prior beliefs with new evidence. Additionally, we identified confidence representations that were independent of specific beliefs and showed distinct temporal profiles. These results demonstrate that probabilistic inference emerges from coordinated dynamics across distributed brain systems, with different regions contributing flexibly according to computational demands at different states of learning and decision-making.",

      "title": "Anxiety Selectively Impairs Reward Learning Under Uncertainty, While N3 Sleep Recalibrates It",
      "content": "Adapting to uncertain environments requires distinguishing stochastic variability from genuine environmental change, yet how anxiety and sleep shape this process remains unclear. Using a probabilistic reversal-learning task that simultaneously manipulated stochasticity and volatility, we show that high trait anxiety selectively impairs reward learning in stable but noisy environments, despite preserved sensitivity to true volatility. Computational modeling revealed that anxious individuals misattribute stochastic fluctuations to environmental change, resulting in elevated reward learning rates and impaired evidence accumulation. In a second experiment combining task performance with overnight sleep EEG, greater N3 sleep was associated with reduced learning rates and improved evidence accumulation. These findings identify a selective computational mechanism underlying anxiety-related learning deficits and suggest N3 sleep as a state-dependent pathway for recalibrating adaptive learning under uncertainty.",

      "title": "Autistic Children Show Reduced Activity in Left Superior Temporal Cortex in Response to Social-emotional Meaning in Language",
      "content": "Background: Autistic children often exhibit challenges in social interaction, emotional processing, and language communication. While differences among autistic children in processing non-linguistic social-emotional cues compared to non-autistic pears are well-documented, the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of social-emotional meaning conveyed through the language content remain unclear. In non-autistic adults, the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS) are sensitive to social-emotional semantics. We investigated whether this neural sensitivity is altered in autistic children. Methods: We recruited 78 children (54 autistic and 24 non-autistic; 68 males, 10 females; mean age 10 years) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while listening to sentences describing either people in emotional situations (social-emotional sentences) or sentences describing non-human objects, events, or concepts (object sentences). Results: Significant activity was found in the left STG and STS in response to social-emotional sentences across both groups, but the activity was reduced in autistic children compared to non-autistic controls. No significant group difference was found during general auditory or object-sentence processing. The neural activity in the left STG and STS during social-emotional sentence processing was significantly predicted by the degree of autistic social-affective characteristics but was not predicted by general linguistic ability. Conclusions: Autistic children show reduced activity in the left STG and STS compared to non-autistic peers during social-emotional sentence processing. This reduced activity, driven by social-affective characteristics rather than general linguistic ability, may contribute to autistic children's social communication challenges.",
