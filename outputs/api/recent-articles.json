      "title": "Sulfate reducing bacteria induce \u03b1-synuclein in intestinal and neuronal cells and tissues and inhibit tyrosine hydroxylase in neuronal cells",
      "content": "IntroductionParkinson\u2019s disease (PD), a synucleopathy characterized by the presence of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates in the brain, is thought to originate in the intestine. Desulfovibrio, resident gut sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), usually found in very low numbers in a healthy gut, are found in higher numbers in PD. In a recent study, a separate group demonstrated that Desulfovibrio isolated from both PD patients and healthy subjects were fed to C. elegans and were found to increase \u03b1-syn aggregates in the head region of the worms. How these bacteria induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in the brain through the gut remain unknown. We tested whether Desulfovibrio induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in the intestinal cells and triggered \u03b1-syn secretion from these cells into the growth medium and whether this growth medium (devoid of bacteria) further induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neurons. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio directly induced \u03b1-syn aggregates in neuronal cells and inhibited protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a key dopamine-producing enzyme. We also tested whether Desulfovibrio increased \u03b1-syn levels in intestine, plasma, and in brain in mice.MethodsEnteroendocrine STC-1 and neuronal SH-Sy5y cells were infected with Desulfovibriovulgaris (DSV). We measured \u03b1-syn aggregation by immunofluorescence. \u03b1-syn levels in cell culture supernatant (sup), tissues, and plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Protein expression of TH and \u03b1-syn was analyzed by Western blot.ResultsWe found that DSV increased the number of STC-1cells with \u03b1-syn aggregates and also induced \u03b1-syn expression in these cells. Sup from DSV-infected STC-1 had higher \u03b1-syn levels compared to control uninfected sup and could induce \u03b1-syn aggregates in SH-Sy5y. DSV also directly induced a syn aggregates and inhibited TH in SH-Sy5y. DSV-gavaged mice had higher levels of \u03b1-syn in the duodenum, plasma, and in brain and also showed a decreasing trend in TH expression in the brain.ConclusionThus, our findings provide a gut-to-brain link tied to the ability of SRB in the gut-to increase expression, aggregation and spread of \u03b1-syn and decrease of TH in PD.",

      "title": "Integrated auditory-vocal embodied training for expressive authentic intonation in Chinese zither performance",
      "content": "BackgroundChinese zither music relies on culturally specific microtones (e. g., FA+ and TI\u2013) that differ from Western equal temperament, yet prolonged exposure to standardized tuning often leads to the erosion of these traditional intonation practices. While embodied cognition theory emphasizes the role of sensorimotor integration in learning, its application to the acquisition of non-fixed pitch systems in intangible cultural heritage music remains underexplored.ObjectiveThis study aimed to examine whether a structured auditory-vocal embodied training protocol\u2014integrating listening, vocal imitation, and metaphoric gestures\u2014could enhance zither learners' accuracy in producing traditional microtones, and to provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of embodied cognition theory in sustaining culturally authentic musical intonation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design was employed with 63 intermediate-level zither students. Participants were assigned to an experimental group, which completed a 1-week auditory-vocal-gestural training program, or a control group, which continued regular practice without multimodal integration. Pitch accuracy on two critical tones (FA+ and TI\u2013) was assessed through pre- and post-tests.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Chinese-style pitch accuracy compared to the control group, along with a marked shift in intonation perception away from equal-tempered biases.ConclusionThe findings indicate that multisensory embodied training, grounded in the principles of perceptual-motor coupling and gestural simulation, effectively promotes the internalization of traditional microtonal intonation. This study not only offers a novel pedagogical approach for preserving intangible cultural heritage in music education but also substantiates the role of embodied cognition in acquiring culturally situated sensorimotor skills.",

      "title": "Automated brain atrophy quantification from clinical MRI predicts early neurological deterioration in anterior choroidal artery territory infarction",
      "content": "BackgroundEarly neurological deterioration (END) occurs in 43%\u201360% of patients with anterior choroidal artery (AChA) territory infarction. While brain atrophy serves as an imaging biomarker of diminished brain reserve capacity and may influence stroke outcomes, its predictive value for END in AChA infarction remains unclear.MethodsThis dual-center retrospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with acute AChA territory infarction admitted to two Chinese stroke centers between September 2018 and September 2024. Clinical T1-weighted images were reconstructed into standardized high-resolution images using the SynthSR deep learning algorithm, followed by fully automated brain tissue segmentation via AssemblyNet. We calculated gray matter fraction (GMF), white matter fraction (WMF), brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), and cerebrospinal fluid fraction (CSFF) to quantify brain atrophy severity. Multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to assess associations between brain atrophy metrics and END.ResultsAmong 206 enrolled patients, 78 (37.86%) developed END. Patients with END demonstrated significantly greater brain atrophy: GMF (P < 0.001), WMF (P < 0.001), and BPF (P < 0.001) were all significantly reduced, while CSFF was correspondingly elevated (P < 0.001). In fully adjusted models, each 0.01-unit increase in WMF was associated with a 58% reduction in END risk (P < 0.001); each 0.01-unit increase in BPF corresponded to a 32% risk reduction (P = 0.002); and each 0.01-unit increase in CSFF was associated with a 52% increase in risk (P < 0.001). Quartile analysis confirmed dose-response relationships: the highest quartiles of WMF and BPF were associated with 91% and 74% reductions in END risk, respectively, while the highest CSFF quartile conferred a 6.2-fold increased risk. RCS analysis confirmed significant linear dose-response relationships between both BPF and CSFF with END (both P-non-linear > 0.05).ConclusionAutomated brain atrophy quantification based on routine clinical MRI can independently predict END risk in patients with AChA infarction, providing a feasible imaging biomarker for this high-risk stroke population and facilitating early risk stratification and treatment optimization.",

      "content": "Moderate-volume brainstem hemorrhage (>5 mL) typically carries an extremely poor prognosis. This article presents a rare case of survival following a large-volume brainstem hemorrhage with therapeutic intervention. A 47-year-old male with hypertension presented with sudden-onset coma. CT imaging revealed a 10.3 mL brainstem hemorrhage. The patient underwent hematoma puncture drainage and tracheostomy, accompanied by hemostatic therapy, intracranial pressure reduction, anti-infection treatment, and neurorehabilitation. During treatment, the patient developed recurrent multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. After 2 months, the patient gradually regained consciousness with improved limb muscle strength, though exhibiting motor aphasia, dysphagia, and urinary/fecal incontinence. Rehabilitation therapy was continued. This case demonstrates that even with large-volume brainstem hemorrhage, comprehensive management including timely drainage, intracranial pressure control, tracheostomy, infection management, and early rehabilitation may achieve survival and consciousness recovery. However, as a single-case report, this study has limited sample size, necessitating further large-scale randomized controlled trials to validate these findings.",

      "title": "Inhibition of histone lysine demethylase restores learning and memory in aged mice",
      "content": "Chromatin undergoes dramatic changes during the ageing process. In the brain, these chromatin changes are thought to underlie age-associated deficits in the activity-dependent gene transcription necessary for memory consolidation. Here, we show that the levels of a specific histone post-translational modification, trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4me3) is markedly increased in the hippocampus of aged mice and that the activity-induced increase in H3K4me3 that is observed in response to a learning stimulus in young mice, is severely blunted in the aged hippocampus. H3K4me3 typically marks open, accessible chromatin at the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of actively transcribed genes. We identify altered H3K4me3 peaks at TSSs and show that ca. 90% of the activity-induced H3K4me3 changes at TSSs are either absent or reduced in the aged hippocampus. To understand the biological significance of these age-associated changes, we screened a library of pharmacological compounds for compounds that can alter H3K4me3 levels in hippocampal neurons. We show that treatment of aged mice with one of these, the LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001, restored normal learning and memory in object location and recognition tasks. Furthermore, we show that ORY-1001 treatment increased long-term potentiation (LTP), a form of synaptic plasticity deficient in the aged hippocampus. These findings suggest that targeting the epigenetic machinery that regulates activity-dependent gene transcription may represent an avenue for treating age-associated cognitive impairment.",

      "title": "Closed-loop acoustic stimulation modified by cathodal tDCS is beneficial for retention",
      "content": "We investigated how combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with closed-loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) during slow-wave sleep (SWS) affects memory consolidation and sleep-related neural oscillations. Cathodal tDCS was used to slightly reduce cortical excitability, thereby simulating a shifted brain state during CLAS and allowing us to compare the effects of standard CLAS to CLAS delivered under altered cortical conditions (CmodCLAS). Twenty-three participants [mean age (SD) 21.3 (2.6) years] completed two experimental nights: one with CLAS alone and one with CLAS combined with cathodal tDCS (CmodCLAS). Overnight retention on declarative memory tasks and morning learning performance were assessed. Memory outcomes revealed that CmodCLAS, but not CLAS alone, significantly improved overnight retention on the figural paired-associate task. In the EEG, CmodCLAS shifted the time-locked response to acoustic stimulation toward more negative potential values at the frontal region. CmodCLAS also prolonged slow oscillation (SO) duration at frontal sites while shortening SO duration at occipital sites, an effect not observed during standard CLAS. These findings demonstrate that the baseline level of cortical excitability during sleep modulates both the cognitive and electrophysiological effects of CLAS. They highlight the importance of brain state for non-invasive CLAS during sleep and suggest that CmodCLAS may serve as a useful approach for enhancing prefrontal cortical function during SWS.",
