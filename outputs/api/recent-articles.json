      "title": "Target Detection Modulates Electroencephalographic Spectral Correlates of Memory Encoding",
      "content": "The current study investigates whether changes in scalp electroencephalographic activity over time reflect the effects of target detection and divided attention on memory encoding. We recorded electroencephalographic activity in 61 young adults as they memorized lists of words either under full attention (single-task) or while performing a secondary task (dual task). In both cases, colored squares appeared with each word. However, in the dual-task condition, participants also pressed a button when the colored squares were in a predefined color (target) but made no response when the squares were in a different color (distractor). Subsequent memory effects in the alpha (8\u201312 Hz) and high gamma (50\u2013100 Hz) frequency bands changed throughout the trial, and these effects differed across conditions. Before word presentation, high gamma activity was associated with encoding success in the target and single-task conditions, but not in the distractor conditions. In contrast, alpha band activity decreased following word presentation, and these decreases were greater for successfully encoded words in the target condition than in the distractor or single-task conditions. The results are consistent with the view that alpha and gamma activity reflect distinct neural processes, which both contribute to memory formation, but are differentially sensitive to task demands and momentary shifts in attention.",

      "title": "The Impact of Auditory Distraction on Visual Memory Encoding in Middle-aged and Older Adults: A High-density Electroencephalography Study",
      "content": "Multitasking is essential for facing the complexity of everyday life environments, where the simultaneous processing of multiple information streams is ubiquitous, and it often requires an increased deployment of attentional resources to manage concurrent tasks. The physiological cognitive decline associated with aging further depletes cognitive resources, making it important to investigate the impact of aging on multitasking abilities, particularly in relation to the mnestic domain. To this aim, we investigated the impact of auditory distraction on visual memory encoding in older adults using high-density electroencephalography. Fifty healthy adults aged 48\u201372 yearscompleted a dual-task paradigm, combining visual memory encoding with an auditory sustained attention task. Behavioral performance was analyzed alongside neural correlates measured through ERPs and theta synchronization during high-density electroencephalography recordings. Participants demonstrated a decline in visual memory recognition performance under the more demanding dual-task condition, but with a stable cost across age. Increasing age negatively impacted overall performance but also subjective confidence. Neurophysiological data showed larger subsequent memory effect amplitudes and increased theta synchronization during dual-tasking, suggesting greater item-specific encoding. Source localization identified the left orbitofrontal and superior temporal gyri as well as the right opercular gyrus as key regions involved in memory encoding under distraction. Increased theta power at rest correlated with worse task performance in older adults, suggesting that neural processing efficiency declines with age. These findings highlight how multitasking interferes with memory encoding in adults, with significant neural recruitment to compensate for dual-task demands.",

      "title": "Misprediction Sensitivity Is Diminished for Action-effects Resulting from Stimulus-driven Movement",
      "content": "While volitional movement is thought to be initiated based on its anticipated capacity to achieve sensory goals, stimulus-driven movement may be generated with less regard for its specific effects. Sensorimotor processes that make use of action-effect predictions may therefore differ between these forms of movement, including sensory attenuation and the detection of mispredicted motor effects. In this study, we explored sensory attenuation by comparing the evoked response of externally-generated tones with those produced by participants (n = 61), both according to their own timing (i.e., volitionally) and in response to simple visual cues (i.e., stimulus-driven). The influence of stimulus identity prediction (i.e., the predictability of tone frequency) on N1 amplitudes was not found to differ between self- and externally-generated stimuli, or on the basis of volitional control. Reduced P2 amplitudes were observed in response to self-generated tones, which may suggest that these were subject to higher levels of attentional control, including processes involved in the termination of attention. To explore misprediction sensitivity, we compared the influence of stimulus identity prediction on N2b component amplitudes. A significant interaction was found to reflect heightened sensitivity to mispredicted outcomes of volitional action, compared with those of stimulus-driven movement. In light of recent evidence that attentional suppression may attenuate the primary cortical response to outcomes of stimulus-driven movement, we propose that this mechanism might also serve to diminish misprediction sensitivity. As such, these effects may represent important features of sensorimotor processing that assist in differentiating stimuli on the basis of self-generation and intentionality.",

      "title": "High-frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Can Improve Attentional Control Under Stress: Behavioral and Electrophysiological Evidence",
      "content": "Psychological stress impairs cognition, forcing attention toward stressor-related information. However, stress may reallocate limited cognitive resources in adaptive ways. How stress modulates the attentional control remains unclear. In this study, the stress-related changes in both target processing and distractor interference were investigated in Experiment 1, where an additional singleton task was employed with a stress group and a control group. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with both stress responses and attentional control. The role of the left DLPFC in regulating attention control under stress was investigated using repetitive TMS in Experiment 2, which included control-vertex, stress-vertex, and stress-DLPFC groups. Electroencephalography was recorded. The results showed that (1) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited increased RT attentional capture effect and greater distractor-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, indicating increased distractor interference under stress; (2) the stress/stress-vertex group exhibited a greater target-elicited N2pc effect compared with the control/control-vertex group, suggesting enhanced target processing under stress; and (3) compared with the stress-vertex group, the stress-DLPFC group exhibited greater target-elicited N2pc effect, but a similar distractor-elicited N2pc effect, suggesting that left-DLPFC stimulation improved target processing but exerted no influence on distractor processing. In addition, faster RTs, along with a reduced RT attentional capture effect, were found for the stress-DLPFC group, implying that the target processing following left-DLPFC stimulation might be less affected by the distractor due to the heightened target processing. The left DLPFC may play a crucial role in modulating attentional control under stress.",

      "title": "A Role of Pupil-linked Arousal, Cingulo-insular Cortex, and Intralaminar Thalamus for Auditory Near-threshold Perception",
      "content": "The perception of near-threshold tones varies strongly across trials, likely because of fluctuations in sustained attention or arousal. We used parallel fMRI and pupillometry to study the role of attention networks for the detection of near-threshold tones in three phases: (1) passive listening, (2) active detection of salient tones, and (3) active detection of near-threshold tones. Results confirmed previous findings from magnetoencephalography that auditory cortex activity and pupil-dilation responses for near-threshold tones were only observed when task-relevant, stronger for hit trials, but also present for miss trials. We then sought which attention-related areas show a similar response pattern, and found it in insular cortex, anterior midcingulate cortex, and inferior precentral sulcus. Moreover, activity in the insula was already stronger for hit than miss trials in the prestimulus interval. Activity for hit trials was also observed in a number of subcortical nuclei, including thalamus, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, and the colliculi. Like insula, activity in the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus additionally showed activity for miss trials and stronger activity for hit trials in the baseline. Finally, BOLD activity correlated to spontaneous pupil fluctuations was evaluated and revealed biphasic activation and deactivation in a widespread cortical network, with a maximum 3 sec and minimum 7 sec after pupil dilation. The cortical networks included insula, anterior midcingulate cortex, retro-splenial, and sensory cortex. Overall, these data identify the cingulo-insular network and the intralaminar thalamic nuclei as potential sources of fluctuations in auditory cortex activity in the context of near-threshold tone detection.",

      "title": "LLMs in Wikipedia: Investigating How LLMs Impact Participation in Knowledge Communities",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.07819v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping knowledge production as community members increasingly incorporate them into their contribution workflows. However, participating in knowledge communities involves more than just contributing content - it is also a deeply social process. While communities must carefully consider appropriate and responsible LLM integration, the absence of concrete norms has left individual editors to experiment and navigate LLM use on their own. Understanding how LLMs influence community participation is therefore critical in shaping future norms and supporting effective adoption. To address this gap, we investigated Wikipedia, one of the largest knowledge production communities, to understand 1) how LLMs influence the ways editors contribute content, 2) what strategies editors leverage to align LLM outputs with community norms, and 3) how other editors in the community respond to LLM-assisted contributions. Through interviews with 16 Wikipedia editors who had used LLMs for their edits, we found that 1) LLMs affected the content contributions for experienced and new editors differently; 2) aligning LLM outputs with community norms required tacit knowledge that often challenged newcomers; and 3) as a result, other editors responded to LLM-assisted edits differently depending on the editors' expertise level. Based on these findings, we challenge existing models of newcomer involvement and propose design implications for LLMs that support community engagement through scaffolding, teaching, and context awareness.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.07742v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In modern online learning, understanding and predicting student behavior is crucial for enhancing engagement and optimizing educational outcomes. This systematic review explores the integration of biosensors and Multimodal Learning Analytics (MmLA) to analyze and predict student behavior during computer-based learning sessions. We examine key challenges, including emotion and attention detection, behavioral analysis, experimental design, and demographic considerations in data collection. Our study highlights the growing role of physiological signals, such as heart rate, brain activity, and eye-tracking, combined with traditional interaction data and self-reports to gain deeper insights into cognitive states and engagement levels. We synthesize findings from 54 key studies, analyzing commonly used methodologies such as advanced machine learning algorithms and multimodal data pre-processing techniques. The review identifies current research trends, limitations, and emerging directions in the field, emphasizing the transformative potential of biosensor-driven adaptive learning systems. Our findings suggest that integrating multimodal data can facilitate personalized learning experiences, real-time feedback, and intelligent educational interventions, ultimately advancing toward a more customized and adaptive online learning experience.",

Using a quantitative exploratory approach, 84 participants from Spain and Germany, divided into three sample groups, assessed UX, task load, presence, cybersickness, and emotional response through standardized questionnaires. Findings indicate that both applications provided a low task load and high enjoyment. The VR-based tour enhanced presence but posed usability and cybersickness challenges, while the AR-based tour achieved high UX ratings, with qualitative feedback suggesting areas for refinement. Correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between age, prior XR experience, and technological affinity with the measured metrics for both applications. These results highlight the importance of well-designed experiences tailored to XR novices, reinforcing the critical role of UX in digital twin-based XR tourism.",

      "title": "Social Media Clones: Exploring the Impact of Social Delegation with AI Clones through a Design Workbook Study",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.07502v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Social media clones are AI-powered social delegates of ourselves created using our personal data. As our identities and online personas intertwine, these technologies have the potential to greatly enhance our social media experience. If mismanaged, however, these clones may also pose new risks to our social reputation and online relationships. To set the foundation for a productive and responsible integration, we set out to understand how social media clones will impact our online behavior and interactions. We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews introducing eight speculative clone concepts to 32 social media users through a design workbook. Applying existing work in AI-mediated communication in the context of social media, we found that although clones can offer convenience and comfort, they can also threaten the user's authenticity and increase skepticism within the online community. As a result, users tend to behave more like their clones to mitigate discrepancies and interaction breakdowns. These findings are discussed through the lens of past literature in identity and impression management to highlight challenges in the adoption of social media clones by the general public, and propose design considerations for their successful integration into social media platforms.",

      "title": "Feed-O-Meter: Fostering Design Feedback Skills through Role-playing Interactions with AI Mentee",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.07424v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Effective feedback, including critique and evaluation, helps designers develop design concepts and refine their ideas, supporting informed decision-making throughout the iterative design process. However, in studio-based design courses, students often struggle to provide feedback due to a lack of confidence and fear of being judged, which limits their ability to develop essential feedback-giving skills. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) suggest that role-playing with AI agents can let learners engage in multi-turn feedback without the anxiety of external judgment or the time constraints of real-world settings. Yet prior studies have raised concerns that LLMs struggle to behave like real people in role-play scenarios, diminishing the educational benefits of these interactions. Therefore, designing AI-based agents that effectively support learners in practicing and developing intellectual reasoning skills requires more than merely assigning the target persona's personality and role to the agent. By addressing these issues, we present Feed-O-Meter, a novel system that employs carefully designed LLM-based agents to create an environment in which students can practice giving design feedback. The system enables users to role-play as mentors, providing feedback to an AI mentee and allowing them to reflect on how that feedback impacts the AI mentee's idea development process. A user study (N=24) indicated that Feed-O-Meter increased participants' engagement and motivation through role-switching and helped them adjust feedback to be more comprehensible for an AI mentee. Based on these findings, we discuss future directions for designing systems to foster feedback skills in design education.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.07334v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate UI design, yet current tools struggle with two fundamentals: externalizing designers' intent and controlling iterative change. We introduce SPEC, a structured, parameterized, hierarchical intermediate representation that exposes UI elements as controllable parameters. Building on SPEC, we present SpecifyUI, an interactive system that extracts SPEC from UI references via region segmentation and vision-language models, composes UIs across multiple sources, and supports targeted edits at global, regional, and component levels. A multi-agent generator renders SPEC into high-fidelity designs, closing the loop between intent expression and controllable generation. Quantitative experiments show SPEC-based generation more faithfully captures reference intent than prompt-based baselines. In a user study with 16 professional designers, SpecifyUI significantly outperformed Stitch on intent alignment, design quality, controllability, and overall experience in human-AI co-creation. Our results position SPEC as a specification-driven paradigm that shifts LLM-assisted design from one-shot prompting to iterative, collaborative workflows.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.07314v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: On Reddit, the moderation queue (modqueue) is a primary interface for moderators to review reported content. Despite its central role in Reddit's community-reliant moderation model, little is known about how moderators actually use it in practice. To address this gap, we surveyed 110 moderators, who collectively oversee more than 400 unique subreddits, and asked them about their usage of the modqueue. Modqueue practices vary widely: some moderators approach it as a daily checklist, others as a hub to infer community-wide patterns, and many still find the queue insufficient to inform their moderation decisions. We also identify persistent challenges around review coordination, inconsistent interface signals, and reliance on third-party tools. Taken together, we show the modqueue is neither a one-size-fits-all solution nor sufficient on its own for supporting moderator review. Our work highlights design opportunities for more modular, integrated, and customizable platform infrastructures that better support the diversity of moderator workflows.",

      "title": "Neurocognitive Modeling for Text Generation: Deep Learning Architecture for EEG Data",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.07202v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Text generating capabilities have undergone a substantial transformation with the introduction of large language models (LLMs). Electroencephalography (EEG)-based text production is still difficult, though, because it requires a lot of data and processing power. This paper introduces a new method that combines the use of the Gemma 2B LLM with a classifier-LLM architecture to incorporate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder. Our approach drastically lowers the amount of data and compute power needed while achieving performance close to that of cutting-edge methods. Notably, compared to current methodologies, our methodology delivers an overall performance improvement of 10%. The suggested architecture demonstrates the possibility of effective transfer learning for EEG-based text production, remaining strong and functional even in the face of data limits. This work highlights the potential of integrating LLMs with EEG decoding to improve assistive technologies and improve independence and communication for those with severe motor limitations. Our method pushes the limits of present capabilities and opens new paths for research and application in brain-computer interfaces by efficiently using the strengths of pre-trained language models. This makes EEG-based text production more accessible and efficient.",
