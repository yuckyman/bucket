      "title": "Evaluation on Human Perception of Various Vibrotactile Encoding Methods Through a High Density Haptic Feedback Interface",
      "content": "High density (HD) haptic interfaces have become increasingly common for entertainment thanks to advancements in virtual reality technology, however their flexibility may make them a useful sensory substitution interface for motor rehabilitation. Yet little research has explored how users interpret different haptic feedback encoding methods. Therefore, this study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of various encoding methods for conveying information based on existing sensory substitution strategies, one being a line motion tracking task and the other a direction tracking task. The first encoding method was Perceived Position Encoding (PPE), where information was encoded into the perceived position of stimulation. The second was Perceived Intensity Encoding (PIE), encoded information into the perceived amplitude of the stimuli. Twenty-one participants performed tracking tasks using both the PIE and PPE methods. The results showed similar performance in line motion tracking between the PIE and PPE methods, although the extra motors used in the PPE method appear to introduce uncertainty in users. Nevertheless, users were significantly more accurate with direction tracking when using PPE. These findings highlight the need for task-specific encoding methods, and showcase the versatility of the HD haptic vest as a tool for augmented feedback in motor rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Enhancing Video Experiences for DHH Individuals Through Sound-Inspired Motion Caption-Based Spatiotemporal Tacton",
      "content": "When deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals watch videos, captions are essential for them to understand the linguistic content. Current captions, however, are not suitable for conveying non-verbal sound information, such as background music, sound effects, or speech nuances. In this paper, we designed a multimodal system, Motion Caption Haptic System (MCHS), that enables DHH individuals to encounter sounds in videos through animated caption and spatiotemporal vibration patterns, supporting a more vivid and immersive experience. We elaborately designed motion captions and spatiotemporal haptic patterns for representative sound effects and spoken emotions to work well together through surveys from 27 DHH and 64 hearing participants. An evaluation with 19 DHH individuals demonstrated the capabilities and potential of the MCHS to improve their video viewing experience, along with a discussion of important issues that need to be addressed when designing multimodal captioning systems for the DHH viewers.",

What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated its effectiveness in both image classification and neuroscience forecasting tasks. Combining human judgments with one or more machines consistently improved overall team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.",

      "content": "arXiv:2503.22697v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Decoding sensory experiences from neural activity to reconstruct human-perceived visual stimuli and semantic content remains a challenge in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Despite notable progress in current brain decoding models, a critical gap still persists in their systematic integration with established neuroscientific theories and the exploration of underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we present a novel framework that directly decodes fMRI signals into textual descriptions of viewed natural images. Our novel deep learning model, trained without visual information, achieves state-of-the-art semantic decoding performance, generating meaningful captions that capture the core semantic content of complex scenes. Neuroanatomical analysis reveals the critical role of higher-level visual cortices, including MT+ complex, ventral stream visual cortex, and inferior parietal cortex, in visual semantic processing. Furthermore, category-specific analysis demonstrates nuanced neural representations for semantic dimensions like animacy and motion. This work provides a more direct and interpretable framework to the brain's semantic decoding, offering a powerful new methodology for probing the neural basis of complex semantic processing, refining the understanding of the distributed semantic network, and potentially developing brain-sinpired language models.",

      "title": "Adaptive Decoding via Hierarchical Neural Information Gradients in Mouse Visual Tasks",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.09451v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding the encoding and decoding mechanisms of dynamic neural responses to different visual stimuli is an important topic in exploring how the brain represents visual information. Currently, hierarchically deep neural networks (DNNs) have played a significant role as tools for mining the core features of complex data. However, most methods often overlook the dynamic generation process of neural data, such as hierarchical brain's visual data, within the brain's structure. In the decoding of brain's visual data, two main paradigms are 'fine-grained decoding tests' and 'rough-grained decoding tests', which we define as focusing on a single brain region and studying the overall structure across multiple brain regions, respectively. In this paper, we mainly use the Visual Coding Neuropixel dataset from the Allen Brain Institute, and the hierarchical information extracted from some single brain regions (i.e., fine-grained decoding tests) is provided to the proposed method for studying the adaptive topological decoding between brain regions, called the Adaptive Topological Vision Transformer, or AT-ViT. In numerous experiments, the results reveal the importance of the proposed method in hierarchical networks in the visual tasks, and also validate the hypothesis that \"the hierarchical information content in brain regions of the visual system can be quantified by decoding outcomes to reflect an information hierarchy.\" Among them, we found that neural data collected in the hippocampus can have a random decoding performance, and this negative impact on performance still holds significant scientific value.",

      "content": "arXiv:2510.09415v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of perceptual consciousness from within: a narrative review of human intracranial research",
      "content": "arXiv:2510.08736v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite many years of research, the quest to identify neural correlates of perceptual consciousness (NCC) remains unresolved. One major obstacle lies in methodological limitations: most studies rely on non-invasive neural measures with limited spatial or temporal resolution making it difficult to disentangle proper NCCs from concurrent cognitive processes. Additionally, the relatively low sensitivity of non-invasive neural measures limits the interpretation of null findings in studies targeting proper NCCs. In this review, we discuss how human intracranial recordings can advance the search for NCCs, by offering high spatiotemporal resolution, improved signal sensitivity, and broad cortical and subcortical coverage. We review studies that have examined NCCs at the level of single neurons and populations of neurons, and evaluate their implications on the debates between cognitive and sensory theories of consciousness. Finally, we highlight the limits of current intracranial human recordings and propose future directions based on emerging technologies and novel experimental paradigms.",

      "title": "LRRK2 Kinase Mediates Increased GCase Activity in Microglia in Response to Proinflammatory Stimuli",
      "content": "Variants in the LRRK2 and GBA1 genes are among the most common risk factors associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Both patients carrying PD-associated variants in GBA1, encoding lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and a subset of non-carrier patients have been shown to have reduced GCase enzymatic activity, suggesting that reduced GCase activity may be a feature of both genetic and a subset of sporadic PD. However, the effect of PD-associated variants in LRRK2, encoding a serine/threonine kinase, on GCase activity remains controversial, with conflicting results in various tissues and cell types. Moreover, rare patients carrying both GBA1 and LRRK2 risk alleles seem to have a more benign disease course than carriers of GBA1 variants alone, suggesting a complex interplay between these two genes in PD. Here we evaluate the effect of LRRK2 kinase activity on GCase activity in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia (iMGs), a PD-relevant brain cell type expressing high levels of LRRK2. Using CRISPR editing, isogenic control iPSC lines were generated to match PD patient-derived iPSC lines harbouring the LRRK2 p.G2019S, p.M1646T, or p.N551K-p.R1398H protective haplotype variants. Whereas iMGs harbouring the p.M1646T variant, and the protective haplotype, respectively increased and decreased phosphorylation of canonical LRRK2 substrate, Rab10, GCase protein levels and activity were not altered in any of the LRRK2 variant lines. Additionally, whereas pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity had no impact on GCase activity in iMGs under basal conditions, it attenuated the increase in GCase activity elicited in response to interferon {gamma} (IFN{gamma}) treatment. Moreover, GCase activity induced by IFN{gamma} was reduced in PD risk LRRK2 p.M1646T iMGs and increased in p.N551K-p.R1398H protective haplotype iMGs compared to their isogenic corrected controls, congruent with their respective effects on LRRK2 kinase activity and PD risk. Thus, our data suggests a role for LRRK2 kinase activity in regulation of GCase activity in response to neuroinflammation.",

      "title": "Beauty in the shadow of neurodegenerative disease: a narrative review on aesthetic experience, neural mechanisms, and therapeutic frontiers",
      "content": "Neuroaesthetics, an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience, psychology, and the arts, offers new perspectives on the biological and cognitive mechanisms of aesthetic experience. This narrative review explores the convergence of neuroaesthetics and neurodegenerative disorders, focusing on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Huntington\u2019s disease. Drawing on evidence from neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and clinical studies, we examine how neurodegenerative processes differentially disrupt the neural systems of the \u201caesthetic triad\u201d: sensory-motor, emotion-valuation, and meaning-knowledge. Such disruptions not only impair patients\u2019 ability to perceive and create art but may also reveal unexpected creative capacities. We discuss the therapeutic potential of arts-based interventions, highlighting the benefits of personalized and technology-driven approaches, including immersive virtual reality and digital art platforms, to enhance neurorehabilitation and psychological wellbeing. The \u201cMichelangelo effect,\u201d where engagement in meaningful aesthetic activities supports learning, motivation, and resilience, exemplifies this translational potential. Our synthesis underscores clinical, neuroscientific, and rehabilitative implications, while noting ongoing challenges such as the need for standardized outcomes and interdisciplinary collaboration. Integrating neuroaesthetic principles into neurorehabilitation may help preserve cognitive and motor functions and enrich quality of life and self-concept in people with neurodegenerative disease. Future research should optimize these approaches to ensure meaningful benefits for patients.",

      "title": "From adolescence to old age: how sensory precision shapes body ownership during physiological aging",
      "content": "Body ownership relies on the integration of multisensory signals coming from the environment and the body itself. Considering the substantial neurophysiological and sensory modifications occurring across the lifespan, this study aims to quantitatively evaluate age-related changes in hand ownership and its underlying bottom-up sensory and top-down components from adolescence to advanced aging. Ninety-two healthy women aged 15\u201383 underwent a virtual-reality based visuo-proprioceptive disparity task in which they performed reiterative reaching movements towards visual targets while observing a virtual-hand that could be spatially congruent or displaced at different disparities from the real hand\u2019s position. Ownership was assessed by collecting reaching errors (implicit) and asking ownership judgments toward the virtual-hand (explicit). Errors were modeled using a Bayesian Causal Inference framework in which ownership for the virtual-hand resulted from a weighted average between pure visual and pure proprioceptive guidance according to their relative precision (i.e., bottom-up sensory components), and to the a priori probability that the virtual-hand was one\u2019s own (i.e., top-down prior). Results showed that both explicit and implicit ownership towards spatially incongruent virtual-hands was higher with advancing age. Moreover, the sensory components extracted from the model revealed higher proprioceptive and lower visual variability in older adults, suggesting that as proprioception declines, visual input increasingly assumes a dominant role. No age-effect was found on the prior (i.e., top-down component). We concluded that ownership progressively changes from adolescence to old age, mostly driven by a physiological reduction in proprioceptive abilities. The sensory recalibration toward visual reliance might reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain coherent body ownership despite age-related sensory decline.",

      "title": "RSA-TransUNet: a robust structure-adaptive TransUNet for enhanced road crack segmentation",
      "content": "With the advancement of deep learning, road crack segmentation has become increasingly crucial for intelligent transportation safety. Despite notable progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing fine-grained textures in small crack regions, handling blurred edges and significant width variations, and performing multi-class segmentation. Moreover, the high computational cost of training such models hinders their practical deployment. To tackle these limitations, we propose RSA-TransUNet, a novel model for road crack segmentation. At its core is the Axial-shift MLP Attention (ASMA) mechanism, which integrates axial perception with sparse contextual modeling. Through multi-path axial perturbations and an attention-guided structure, ASMA effectively captures long-range dependencies within row-column patterns, enabling detailed modeling of multi-scale crack features. To improve the model\u2019s adaptability to structural irregularities, we introduce the Adaptive Spline Linear Unit (ASLU), which enhances the model\u2019s capacity to represent nonlinear transformations. ASLU improves responsiveness to microstructural variations, morphological distortions, and local discontinuities, thereby boosting robustness across different domains. We further develop a Structure-aware Multi-stage Evolutionary Optimization (SMEO) strategy, which guides the training process through three phases: structural perception exploration, feature stability enhancement, and global perturbation. This strategy combines breadth sampling, convergence compression, and local escape mechanisms to improve convergence speed, global search efficiency, and generalization performance. Extensive evaluations on the Crack500, CFD, and DeepCrack datasets\u2014including ablation studies and comparative experiments\u2014demonstrate that RSA-TransUNet achieves superior segmentation accuracy and robustness in complex road environments, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",
