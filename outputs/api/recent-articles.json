      "title": "Brain-immune interactions generate pathogen-specific sickness states",
      "content": "In nature, animals encounter diverse pathogens that trigger specific peripheral defense programs and elicit sickness behavior, a set of stereotyped physiological and behavioral changes thought to promote host fitness. Most studies to date have relied on one or a few mouse models of infection, limiting insights into pathogen-specific neuroimmune interactions that generate sickness. We hypothesized that different pathogens might elicit distinct sickness states by engaging different cell types and brain circuits. Using inflammatory models representing bacterial, viral, allergic, parasitic or colitis conditions, we assessed sickness across scales: organismal (behavior and physiology); cellular (brain-wide neural activity); and molecular (single-cell in situ transcriptomics in hypothalamus areas associated with social and homeostatic functions affected during sickness). Remarkably, immune challenges elicited unique repertoires of changes across all scales. Our findings reveal pathogen-specific sickness states encoded by the brain across scales, thereby broadening our understanding of how infections make us sick.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbance is associated with increased repetitive sensorimotor behaviour in autism but not in learning/intellectual disabilities or ADHD: A comparative study",
      "content": "The interplay of sleep and sensorimotor processing is a fundamental neurobiological process crucial for well-being. Individuals with neurodevelopmental conditions like autism, ADHD, and intellectual/learning disabilities frequently experience both significant sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Although a link between these domains is established, it is unclear whether this relationship and its functional impact are consistent across different neurodevelopmental conditions. In a cross-sectional dataset of individuals aged 5-21 (n = 212), we investigated whether the interplay between sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours differs between individuals diagnosed with autism (IQ>70), ADHD, a learning disability (IQ<70), as well as typically developed controls. We also examined whether interactions between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours predicts distinct functional outcomes between neurodevelopmental groups. We found that individuals with autism (IQ>70) were most strongly affected by both sleep disturbance and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours. Crucially, we show that while a robust bidirectional link between sleep and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours exists across the entire sample, sleep problems amplify repetitive sensorimotor behaviours more strongly only in autistic people than in typical controls. Contrary to previous work, we found that learning disabled children and adolescents engaged in more repetitive sensorimotor behaviour but did not experience more sleep disturbance. Although the interaction between sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviours did not determine functional outcomes in autistic people, the interplay of sleep problems and repetitive sensorimotor behaviour impaired social awareness in people with ADHD. These findings challenge a transdiagnostic view that treats the reinforcement between sleep and sensorimotor problems as a general marker of neurodevelopmental conditions. Understanding the distinct pathways between sleep and waking behaviours is a critical step toward developing personalized, mechanistic interventions targeting specific sleep and sensory impairment profiles in different neurodevelopmental conditions.",

      "title": "Convergent pathways with impaired inhibition at the frontal cortex are the outcome of differential alterations in the male and female schizophrenia model",
      "content": "Schizophrenia is associated with impaired inhibitory neurotransmission and disrupted synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), yet the biological mechanisms underlying these deficits may differ between sexes. Here, we used a double-hit rat model, combining perinatal NMDA receptor blockade and post-weaning social isolation, to dissect sex-specific alterations in inhibitory circuit maturation, synaptic plasticity, and prefrontal function. Male double-hit rats exhibited robust schizophrenia-like behaviors, reduced parvalbumin (PV), OTX2, and perineuronal net (PNN) expression, decreased GAD67 levels, and increased DNA damage in PV interneurons, together indicating impaired inhibitory maturation and weakened plasticity. In contrast, females showed milder behavioral deficits but displayed increased PV and OTX2 intensities, enhanced cFos activation in excitatory neurons, and transcriptomic upregulation of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and synapse assembly pathways, suggesting a state of heightened or dysregulated plasticity. Despite these divergent molecular trajectories, in vivo electrophysiology revealed a shared functional endpoint in both sexes: a shift from paired-pulse inhibition to facilitation during basolateral amygdala-evoked responses, reflecting impaired GABAB-mediated inhibitory feedback. Pharmacological blockade of GABAB, but not GABAA, receptors reproduced this phenotype, identifying GABAB signaling as a key mechanism underlying cortical disinhibition. Altogether, our findings reveal that males and females reach convergent prefrontal inhibitory deficits through sex-specific molecular pathways, underscoring the importance of sex as a biological variable in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Effects of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis on Bladder Function and Properties of Pelvic Ganglion Neurons",
      "content": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) has substantial impacts on autonomic function. In part, MS results in loss of normal autonomic activity that contributes to disease-associated pathology such as neurogenic bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Yet little is known of the impacts of MS on peripheral autonomic neurons that directly innervate these target organs. In this study, we measured changes in properties of neurons of the mouse major pelvic ganglion (MPG) associated with two different levels of severity in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Our data show that bladder function and physiological properties of MPG neurons are altered in association with EAE, and differ between less and more severe clinical scores associated with disease progression. EAE results in decreased bladder function measured by decreased urine output and increased micturition pressures. In the most severely affected animals, action potentials (APs) show increased half-widths as a result of decreased maximum decay slopes leading to overall broader and longer APs and lower maximum firing frequency. These changes in AP properties are associated with differences in ion channel subunit expression as well. KCNA1-4, KCNN3, SCN2A1 and SCN3A mRNA levels in MPGs decreased with disease severity. Taken together, our data indicate that peripheral autonomic neurons are fundamentally altered in EAE, suggesting that longer-term therapeutic approaches for MS could target these neurons directly to potentially help ameliorate neurogenic target organ dysfunction.",

      "title": "Coordination of spike timing among the neurons of the cerebellum",
      "content": "We tend to think of neurons as either excitatory or inhibitory, but certain neurons chemically inhibit their downstream targets while electrically exciting their neighbors. For example, in the cerebellum, molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) inhibit Purkinje cells (P-cells) via release of GABA but promote spiking in each other via gap junctions. What is gained by having an inhibitory neuron excite its neighbor? Here, we recorded activities of P-cells and MLIs as marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and found that spike timing in pairs of neighboring neurons of the same type exhibited a mathematical regularity: as firing rates increased, rate of spikes that were within 1ms of each other grew disproportionately while 2-4ms intervals were suppressed. To uncover the purpose of this coordination, during saccades we recorded thousands of neuron triplets in which two MLIs converged onto a single target P-cell. When the MLIs spiked within 1ms of each other, they produced superposition of their individual effects on their target; a deep inhibition followed by a post-inhibitory rebound. However, when the MLIs spiked 2-4ms apart, the two spikes interfered with each other, producing partial cancellation. Thus, electrical coupling between inhibitory neurons orchestrated their spike timing so that as firing rates increased, the temporal intervals that induced downstream superposition were promoted while the intervals that caused interference were suppressed.",
