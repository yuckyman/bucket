      "content": "<p>There are 8.2 billion humans on earth.</p>\n<p>We're extremely dynamic. You will meet people all through your life with different personalities, skills, and interests. This individual uniqueness not only makes life more interesting, but it also increases our collective ability to handle a wide range of ideas and problems.</p>\n<p>Despite these capabilities, our differences can also lead to an overwhelming feeling of division in some. Differences often lead to disagreement, anger, hostility, or violence. To say humans don't often inflict cruelty on one another would be a lie. We absolutely have shown our teeth. In innumerable ways, we've caused horror to our own species. We've dehumanized, caused suffering, and in many cases killed one another.</p>\n<p>In many ways, we're still learning. Humanity is still growing. A lot of people are trying to sort right from wrong, fair from unfair, true from untrue. This leads to a lot of confusion, a lot of chaos, and a lot of violence. To see humans go after other humans in such efficient and relentless manners is terrifying and beyond disheartening. It can be easy to lose hope, but the truth is... <em>none of it is necessary.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>None of the violence, none of the hate, none of the inequality is mandatory.</strong></em></p>\n<p>We are allowed to go against the grain of things we know are wrong. <em>We are allowed to improve our world.</em> Never be scared to do what you know is right, even when its hard, even when it might benefit someone else more than yourself. Match relentless selfishness with your own relentless generosity. Resist chaos and confusion with serenity and understanding. Engulf violence with endless harmony.</p>\n<p>Remember that truth doesn't rely on anyone. Truth doesn't ask for our opinions. Truth is eternal, unwavering, and it will always be there, waiting for us to realize what we're capable of together.</p>\n<hr />\n<ul>\n<li>&quot;<em><strong>In this world there\u2019s room for everyone and the good earth is rich, and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</strong></em> Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much, and feel too little. <em><strong>More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost.</strong></em>&quot; - Charlie Chaplin</li>\n</ul>",

      "title": "Modafinil Modulation of Oscillatory and Aperiodic Brain Activity in Rats Across Wakefulness and Subsequent Sleep",
      "content": "Cortical states shape sensory processing, decision-making, and behavior, and are characterized by distinct patterns of neuronal oscillatory activity. Pharmacological agents can modulate these states and their underlying electrophysiological signatures. Modafinil is a widely used wake-promoting agent and cognitive enhancer, but its effects on cortical oscillations are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated the effect of modafinil on cortical activity during wakefulness and subsequent sleep. Ten male Wistar rats were implanted with electrocorticographic electrodes and recorded following oral administration of modafinil or its vehicle. Our results show that modafinil increased wakefulness in a dose-dependent manner, with doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg producing prolonged wake episodes and reducing hypnogram complexity. During wakefulness, modafinil enhanced gamma-band power in anterior cortices, an effect primarily driven by increases in the aperiodic rather than oscillatory components. Although no sleep rebound was observed, subsequent NREM sleep exhibited increased delta power, particularly in anterior regions, indicating heightened sleep pressure. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that modafinil-induced wakefulness is associated with an enhanced aperiodic gamma band component at the anterior cortices in the EEG. Furthermore, modafinil modulates sleep homeostasis by enhancing NREM sleep intensity rather than extending its duration.",

      "title": "Wasf1 deletion attenuates tau hyperphosphorylation, microglial state transition, and cognitive deficits in P301S tau mice",
      "content": "We previously reported that WAVE1, a major activator of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization, is downregulated in postmortem brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that WAVE1 regulates amyloid precursor protein trafficking and amyloid-{beta} production. However, its role in tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that WAVE1 activity is suppressed in P301S tau mice through elevated inhibitory phosphorylation. Strikingly, WAVE1 gene (Wasf1) knockout in P301S tau mice significantly reduces tau hyperphosphorylation and improves cognition, suggesting a compensatory role for WAVE1 suppression in tau pathogenesis. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals that Wasf1 deletion in P301S tau mice reverses microglial state transitions, with minimal impact on other brain cell types. Wasf1 mRNA is highly translated in microglia in non-Tg mice, while its expression is downregulated in P301S tau mice. Wasf1 knockdown in BV2 microglia cells enhances the degradation of engulfed tau fibrils, indicating WAVE1 as an endogenous regulator of microglial function. Additionally, CellChat analysis indicates that Wasf1 deletion alters microglial autocrine signaling and their interactions with other cell types in P301S tau mice. These findings, taken together, suggest that Wasf1 deletion restores homeostatic microglial function, mitigates tau pathology, and alleviates cognitive deficits, highlighting WAVE1 as a potential therapeutic target for tauopathy-related dementias.",

      "title": "Region-specific features of early glial activation and Aquaporin-4 dysregulation in conditional mouse models of TDP-43 proteinopathies",
      "content": "Aggregation and cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43 are key features of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Neuroinflammatory processes mediated by glial cells play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of these and other diseases, defined as TDP-43 proteinopathies. Here, we characterized region-specific glial activation in two conditional mouse models: hTDP-43-WT (overexpressing nuclear wild-type human TDP-43) and hTDP-43-{Delta}NLS (expressing cytoplasmic TDP-43 with altered nuclear localization signal) following one month of transgene expression. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed distinct patterns of microglial activation across brain regions. hTDP-43-WT mice exhibited significant microgliosis in motor (MC) and somatosensory (SSC) cortices and hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) with pronounced morphological alterations (i.e. increased soma size). Sholl analysis demonstrated reduced branching length and complexity in MC, SSC and hippocampal subfields. hTDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice displayed more pronounced microglial activation in hippocampal regions (CA1, DG) compared to cortical areas, with significant increases in microglial density. Additionally, we observed region-specific cortical astrocytosis in both models, suggesting coordinated glial reactivity. hTDP-43-{Delta}NLS mice showed decreased polarization of astrocytic water channel Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) around vascular structures in SSC and hippocampal CA1/DG. The changes in AQP4 localization, which is critical for glymphatic function, supports the hypothesis that this waste clearance system for the brain is altered in TDP-43 proteinopathies. These findings demonstrate that these different animal models of ALS/FTD induce distinct neuroinflammatory signatures, potentially contributing to the region-specific vulnerability observed in these diseases. Our data provide insights into early glial-mediated pathogenic mechanisms that could guide targeted therapeutic strategies for TDP-43 proteinopathies.",

      "title": "The geometry of context-dependent biased decisions during learning",
      "content": "Adaptive behavior requires inferring latent context and rapidly adjusting decisions in response to changing environmental contingencies. We investigated how reward context is learned, represented, and updated during decision making. We recorded large populations of neurons in lateral prefrontal cortex while macaque monkeys learned a direction-discrimination task in which reward contingencies alternated unpredictably between favoring leftward and rightward choices. Once trained, monkeys inferred context switches from a single unexpected outcome, immediately adjusting both choice bias and reaction times---hallmarks of model-based inference. Early in learning, however, adaptation unfolded gradually across multiple trials. Neural population analyses revealed that reward context was encoded through systematic shifts in the geometry of neural representations. Accumulated sensory evidence (decision variable) and choice were organized along curvilinear decision manifolds, which were displaced across contexts primarily along the decision-variable axis. This geometry naturally implemented context-dependent biases: a fixed linear readout generated different choice tendencies across contexts without remapping. Longitudinal recordings further showed that, with learning, these representational transitions between manifolds became faster, mirroring the emergence of one-trial behavioral generalization. Recurrent neural networks trained on the same task reproduced both the behavioral signatures and the context-dependent geometric shifts. Together, these findings identify a mechanism by which prefrontal circuits support hierarchical inference: reward context is encoded as structured shifts in representational geometry, enabling rapid generalization and flexible control of decision policies.",

      "title": "Leveraging Pretrained Vision Transformers for classifying Alcohol Use Disorder using Raw Resting-State EEG",
      "content": "Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a prevalent and debilitating neuropsychiatric condition characterized by compulsive alcohol consumption, impaired control, and negative emotional states, affecting about 28 million adults in the United States. Despite its significant public health burden, there are few objective biomarkers and no reliable neurophysiological tools to assist in its clinical diagnosis. In this study, we investigated the potential of deep learning to classify individuals with AUD using raw resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data. EEG recordings were obtained from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA), a large, longitudinal, multi-site dataset. The initial cohort included a total of 5,402 recordings from 2,710 participants (aged 12-83 years, mean age 24; 1,338 males and 1,372 females). To reduce confounding factors, we applied demographic matching, and to address class imbalance, we applied undersampling. Minimal preprocessing was applied to preserve the raw EEG features. We utilized EEGViT, a hybrid deep learning architecture that combines convolutional patch embedding with a Vision Transformer (ViT) pretrained on ImageNet, thereby enabling end-to-end learning directly from raw EEG input. The analysis was stratified by sex and age, and all groups were age-matched. To validate the generalization of the model, models were also trained for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Results for the AUD model showed a classification accuracy of approximately 56% in the overall dataset, 54% for males, and 58% for females. The CUD model showed an accuracy of about 63%, with 59% for females and 69% for males. The OUD model showed an accuracy of about 63%, with 61% for females and 65% for males. Temporal analysis indicated that the model's performance varied across time intervals, with higher accuracy observed in later minutes compared to earlier ones. While modest, these findings underscore the potential of transformer-based models in psychiatric classification using raw EEG data and provide a foundation for future development of EEG-based diagnostic tools for AUD.",
