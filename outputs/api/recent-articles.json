      "content": "[11C]UCB-J is a radioligand targeting synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, used to image synaptic density. For quantification, a small-volume centrum semiovale area was previously optimized as a [11C]UCB-J reference region (CS2mL); however, its high variability resulted in reduced reliability. Herin, we evaluated an alternative reference region method to assess longitudinal test-retest reliability and detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). For estimating distribution volume ratio (DVR), CS2mL and eleven white matter (WM) reference regions (range: 0.5-200 mL) were generated using the Freesurfer WM map. Same-day and longitudinal test-retest variability (TRV) were assessed (24 healthy subjects (HS); n=10 same-day and n=20 longitudinal HRRT scans, range: 7-1028 days). Each reference region was used to evaluate the substantia nigra (SN) and caudate DVRs in HS (n=25) and PD (n=20). The 10mL WM reference region yielded [11C]UCB-J DVR measurements with reduced variability in TRV (same-day: 10mL: 1.2{+/-}5.7%, same-day: CS2mL: -0.9{+/-}9.2% longitudinal: 10mL: 1.5{+/-}7.0%, CS2mL: 1.6{+/-}11.9%,) while maintaining less than 10% volume of distribution difference, compared to CS2mL. Further, a significant difference between PD and HS groups in SN and caudate DVRs was found using 10mL, with greater effect size (Cohen's d 0.61 for SN and 0.66 for caudate) compared to CS2mL (0.38 for SN and 0.43 for caudate).",

      "title": "Ascending propriospinal modulation of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons during lumbar locomotor activity",
      "content": "Although the autonomic sympathetic system is activated in parallel with locomotion, the underlying neural mechanisms mediating this coordination are not completely understood. Descending exercise or central command signals from hypothalamic and brainstem regions are thought to activate thoracic spinal sympathetic neurons in parallel with descending locomotor commands. In turn, subsets of thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) then increase activation of a constellation of tissues and organs that provide homeostatic and metabolic support during movement and exercise. It is known that neurons within the spinal cord (propriospinal networks) can generate well-coordinated and sustained locomotor activity but whether these propriospinal networks contribute to coordination between locomotor and autonomic systems is unknown. To investigate this, we applied neurochemicals to elicit whole-cord or lumbar-evoked locomotor activity in an in vitro spinal cord preparation, simultaneously recording lumbar ventral root (VR) activity and changes in calcium fluorescence of pre-labelled SPNs in thoracic segments. Using whole-bath drug application to elicit hindlimb locomotor activity, recorded SPN responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) compared to caudal (T8 to T11) segments. When locomotor-inducing neurochemicals were applied only to the lumbar region using a split-bath configuration, SPN population responses were increased in rostral (T4 to T7) but not caudal (T8 to T9) segments during both tonic and rhythmic VR activity. In both approaches, the greatest numbers of SPNs with increased fluorescence during rhythmic activity were in T6/7, whereas the greatest numbers with unchanged or decreased fluorescence were in caudal segments (T8 to T11). Together these findings reveal a strong ascending lumbar to thoracic integrating communication pathway and may represent a key feature of spinal neural network function normally. Such communication pathways should be further investigated for targeted autonomic function(s) activation and therapeutic benefit after spinal cord injury.",

      "title": "Longitudinal intergenerational hyperscanning reveals indices of relationship formation and loneliness",
      "content": "Loneliness is globally acknowledged as a severe and burgeoning health risk, fuelling interest in helping people of all ages form meaningful social connections. One promising approach consists of intergenerational social programs. While behavioural and qualitative evidence derived from such programs promise health and wellbeing benefits, the physiological consequences of repeated intergenerational encounters remain unknown. Insight into physiological changes will shed light on the mechanisms of social connection and inform program design choices. We charted changes in interpersonal neural synchrony (INS) in 31 intergenerational (older/younger adult) and 30 same generation (younger adult) dyads across a six-session art program. At each session, dyads completed self-report measures, drew together and alone, and had their cortical activation recorded with fNIRS. In both groups, INS was greater while dyads drew together than alone. Across sessions, intergenerational dyads' INS decreased and same generation dyads' INS increased. Further findings highlight the promise of INS as a biomarker for changes in loneliness and the development of social relationships.",

      "title": "Network Activity Shapes Inhibitory Synaptic Development in the Mouse Hippocampus",
      "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",

      "title": "Stereoelectroencephalography Reveals Neural Signatures of Multisensory Integration in the Human Superior Temporal Sulcus during Audiovisual Speech Perception",
      "content": "<p>Human speech perception is multisensory, integrating auditory information from the talker's voice with visual information from the talker's face. BOLD fMRI studies have implicated the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in processing auditory speech and the superior temporal sulcus (STS) in integrating auditory and visual speech, but as an indirect hemodynamic measure, fMRI is limited in its ability to track the rapid neural computations underlying speech perception. Using stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) electrodes, we directly recorded from the STG and STS in 42 epilepsy patients (25F, 17M). Participants identified single words presented in auditory, visual, and audiovisual formats with and without added auditory noise. Seeing the talker's face provided a strong perceptual benefit, improving perception of noisy speech in every participant. Neurally, a subpopulation of electrodes concentrated in mid-posterior STG and STS responded to both auditory speech (latency 71&nbsp;ms) and visual speech (109&nbsp;ms). Significant multisensory enhancement was observed, especially in the upper bank of the STS: compared with auditory-only speech, the response latency for audiovisual speech was 40% faster and the response amplitude was 18% larger. In contrast, STG showed neither faster nor larger multisensory responses. Surprisingly, STS response latencies for audiovisual speech were significantly faster than those in the STG (50&nbsp;ms vs 64&nbsp;ms), suggesting a parallel pathway model in which the STG plays the primary role in auditory-only speech perception, while the STS takes the lead in audiovisual speech perception. Together with fMRI, sEEG provides converging evidence that STS plays a key role in multisensory integration.</p>",

      "title": "Competition between Tool and Hand Motion Impairs Movement Planning in Limb Apraxia",
      "content": "<p>Tool use is a complex motor planning problem. Prior research suggests that planning to use tools involves resolving competition between different tool-related action representations. We therefore reasoned that competition may also be exacerbated with tools for which the motions of the tool and the hand are incongruent (e.g., pinching the fingers to open a clothespin). If this hypothesis is correct, we should observe marked deficits in planning the use of incongruent as compared with congruent tools in individuals with limb apraxia following left hemisphere stroke (LCVA), a disorder associated with abnormal action competition. We asked 34 individuals with chronic LCVA (14 females) and 16 matched neurotypical controls (8 females) to use novel tools in which the correspondence between the motions of the hand and tool-tip were either congruent or incongruent. Individuals with LCVA also completed background assessments to quantify apraxia severity. We observed increased planning time for incongruent as compared with congruent tools as a function of apraxia severity. Further analysis revealed that this impairment predominantly occurred early in the task when the tools were first introduced. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses revealed that lesions to posterior temporal and inferior parietal areas were associated with impaired planning for incongruent tools. A second experiment on the same individuals with LCVA revealed that the ability to gesture the use of conventional tools was impaired for tools rated as more incongruent by a normative sample. These findings suggest that tool-hand incongruence evokes action competition and influences the tool-use difficulties experienced by people with apraxia.</p>",
