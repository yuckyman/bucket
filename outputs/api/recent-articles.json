      "title": "cuBNM: GPU-Accelerated Brain Network Modeling",
      "content": "Brain network modeling uses computer simulations to infer about latent neural properties at micro- and mesoscales by fitting brain dynamic models to empirical data of individual subjects or groups. However, computational costs of (individualized) model fitting is a major bottleneck, limiting the practical feasibility of this approach to larger cohorts and more complex models, and highlighting the need for scalable simulation implementations. Here, we introduce cuBNM, a Python package which leverages parallel processing of graphics processing units to massively accelerate simulations of brain network models. We show running simulations on graphics processing units is several hundred times faster compared to central processing units. We demonstrate the usage of cuBNM by running optimization of group-level and individualized low- and high-dimensional models. As examples of the utility of individualized models, we investigated test-retest reliability and heritability of simulated and empirical measures in the Human Connectome Project dataset, and found simulated features to be fairly reliable and heritable. Overall, cuBNM provides an efficient framework for large-scale simulations of brain network models, facilitating investigations of latent neural processes across larger cohorts, denser networks, and higher-dimensional models, which were previously less feasible in practice.",

      "title": "Selective targeting of hippocampal fast-spiking basket cell interneurons via noninvasive enhancer-AAV delivery",
      "content": "Accurate targeting of specific brain regions through non-invasive methods has long been a major goal of basic and translational neuroscience. Systemic delivery of AAVs expressing highly region- and cell-type-specific regulatory elements (enhancer-AAVs) continues to emerge as a tractable solution. Here we performed an independent characterization of a novel enhancer element with apparent robust transgene expression in fast-spiking basket cell interneurons in mouse hippocampus. Surprisingly, this vector did not induce expression in other brain regions harboring the same neuron class. Following intravenous administration in mice, robust labeling of FS-BCs across all hippocampal subfields was observed. We validated the FS-BC specificity in hippocampus using immunofluorescence and electrophysiological recordings. Viral labeling was confined to parvalbumin-positive cells exhibiting basket cell morphology and fast-spiking responses. This approach represents a promising avenue for both mechanistic investigation of hippocampal circuit function and potential therapeutic interventions targeting hippocampal pathophysiologies such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and other neurological disorders in mice and potentially other species.",

      "title": "A Surgical Protocol for a Large, Resealable Cranial Window Enabling Longitudinal, Multi-Modal Electrophysiological Recordings of the Mouse Default Mode Network",
      "content": "The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a central large-scale brain network implicated in a range of cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Studying the DMN's complex dynamics in animal models provides invaluable insights into its function in both healthy and pathological states. However, performing a stable, long-term, and large-scale electrophysiological recordings from the multiple, deep, and distributed nodes of the DMN in awake, behaving mice has been a significant challenge. Here, we present a novel, two-phase surgical protocol developed to create a large (4x7.6 mm), durable, and resealable cranial window in mice. The procedure is designed to preserve the integrity of the dura mater, which is paramount for long-term brain health and recording stability. This window facilitates repeated, longitudinal recordings from over 1,000 electrodes simultaneously by combining surface-level micro-electrocorticography (micro-ECoG) with two high-density intracranial electrode probes, allowing unprecedented access to the DMN. This technique provides a robust platform for multi-modal, multi-scale interrogation of network-wide electrophysiological dynamics over several weeks, opening new avenues for investigating the neuroplastic changes underlying the pathophysiology of brain disorders and for evaluating the chronic effects of novel therapeutics.",

      "title": "Does Infarct Size Influence Gut Barrier Integrity and Bacterial Translocation after Experimental Stroke?",
      "content": "Background: Ischemic stroke (IS) triggers brain injury and systemic changes, including gut dysbiosis, intestinal barrier dysfunction (IBD), and bacterial translocation (BT). Although larger infarcts are associated with higher infection risk, it is unclear whether lesion size directly influences gut barrier integrity or bacterial dissemination. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) proximally or distally to generate large or small infarcts. Seventy two hours post ischemia, infarct volume was measured by MRI, and BT was assessed in mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and lungs. ZO1 and MMP9 expression were used to evaluate intestinal barrier integrity. Peripheral and central inflammation were assessed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Results: Proximal MCAO produced larger infarcts than distal MCAO. The proportion of animals exhibiting BT was lower in distal MCAO, but this difference was not statistically significant. ZO1 expression did not differ between groups, while MMP9 was increased only in animals with BT, independent of infarct size. BT was associated with more pronounced lymphopenia and enhanced microglial activation and T cell infiltration in the brain. The composition of translocated bacteria was similar across groups. Conclusions: Infarct size alone does not determine IBD or BT, although BT is linked to intestinal and cerebral inflammation. This study evaluates for the first time the effect of lesion magnitude on IBD and BT, highlighting the complex interplay between cerebral injury and gut systemic interactions.",

Previous research shows a lack of specific design standards in NFB research and its application. Beyond limited literature on continuous and intermittent feedback presentation effects, most NFB design parameters remain largely understudied. Studies in the context of interface design has pointed at possible effects of aesthetics and task difficulty, indicating an interaction effect of aesthetics on performance and perseverance in difficult task conditions. The study at hand evaluates whether similar effects emerge in the context of NFB. In order to address this question, aesthetics and NFB illusion of success were manipulated experimentally in a sham NFB study (N = 24) following a 2 \u00d7 2 within-subjects design. The main dependent variables were perseverance behavior, subjective workload, motivation, and EEG activity. Results indicated an interaction between pleasing design, illusion of success, and participant age affecting perseverance and physical demand. Alpha-1 band amplitudes were modulated by an interaction between pleasing design and age, and a main effect of the illusion of success emerged. Surprisingly, only the illusion of success variable appeared to exert a meaningful influence on the workload and motivation context. Discussing the observed results, the study partially confirms the hypothesis of aesthetics affecting the outcome when the task is difficult in the context of NFB. The relevance of the age variable is addressed, and potential effects in the context of executive functioning and technology adoption processes are considered. Results encourage further research on the topic of NFB design optimization, including verum NFB in the patient population to increase NFB therapy potential.",
