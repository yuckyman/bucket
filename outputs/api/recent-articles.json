      "title": "The Impact of Device Type, Data Practices, and Use Case Scenarios on Privacy Concerns about Eye-tracked Augmented Reality in the United States and Germany",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.09285v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Augmented reality technology will likely be prevalent with more affordable head-mounted displays. Integrating novel interaction modalities such as eye trackers into head-mounted displays could lead to collecting vast amounts of biometric data, which may allow inference of sensitive user attributes like health status or sexual preference, posing privacy issues. While previous works broadly examined privacy concerns about augmented reality, ours is the first to extensively explore privacy concerns on behavioral data, particularly eye tracking in augmented reality. We crowdsourced four survey studies in the United States (n1 = 48, n2 = 525) and Germany (n3 = 48, n4 = 525) to understand the impact of user attributes, augmented reality devices, use cases, data practices, and country on privacy concerns. Our findings indicate that participants are generally concerned about privacy when they know what inferences can be made based on the collected data. Despite the more prominent use of smartphones in daily life than augmented reality glasses, we found no indications of differing privacy concerns depending on the device type. In addition, our participants are more comfortable when a particular use case benefits them and less comfortable when other humans can consume their data. Furthermore, participants in the United States are less concerned about their privacy than those in Germany. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to practitioners and policymakers for privacy-aware augmented reality.",

      "title": "Flip Co-op: Cooperative Takeovers in Shared Autonomy",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.09281v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Shared autonomy requires principled mechanisms for allocating and transferring control between a human and an autonomous agent. Existing approaches often rely on blending control inputs between human and autonomous agent or switching rules, which lack theoretical guarantees. This paper develops a game-theoretic framework for modeling cooperative takeover in shared autonomy. We formulate the switching interaction as a dynamic game in which authority is embedded directly into the system dynamics, resulting in Nash equilibrium(NE)-based strategies rather than ad hoc switching rules. We establish the existence and characterization of NE in the space of pure takeover strategies under stochastic human intent. For the class of linear-quadratic systems, we derive closed-form recursions for takeover strategies and saddle-point value functions, providing analytical insight and efficient computation of cooperative takeover policies. We further introduce a bimatrix potential game reformulation to address scenarios where human and autonomy utilities are not perfectly aligned, yielding a unifying potential function that preserves tractability while capturing intent deviations. The framework is applied to a vehicle trajectory tracking problem, demonstrating how equilibrium takeover strategies adapt across straight and curved path segments. The results highlight the trade-off between human adaptability and autonomous efficiency and illustrate the practical benefits of grounding shared autonomy in cooperative game theory.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.09255v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Proactive AR agents promise context-aware assistance, but their interactions often rely on explicit voice prompts or responses, which can be disruptive or socially awkward. We introduce Sensible Agent, a framework designed for unobtrusive interaction with these proactive agents. Sensible Agent dynamically adapts both \"what\" assistance to offer and, crucially, \"how\" to deliver it, based on real-time multimodal context sensing. Informed by an expert workshop (n=12) and a data annotation study (n=40), the framework leverages egocentric cameras, multimodal sensing, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to infer context and suggest appropriate actions delivered via minimally intrusive interaction modes. We demonstrate our prototype on an XR headset through a user study (n=10) in both AR and VR scenarios. Results indicate that Sensible Agent significantly reduces perceived interaction effort compared to voice-prompted baseline, while maintaining high usability and achieving higher preference.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.09138v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Live streaming platforms offer a distinctive way for users and content creators to interact with each other through real-time communication. While research on user behavior in online platforms has explored how users discover their favorite content from creators and engage with them, the role of real-time features remains unclear. There are open questions as to what commonalities and differences exist in users' relationships with live streaming platforms compared to traditional on-demand style platforms. To understand this, we employ the concept of Exploration/Exploitation (E/E) and analyze a large-scale dataset from a live streaming platform over two years. Our results indicate that even on live streaming platforms, users exhibit E/E behavior but experience a longer exploration period. We also identify external factors, such as circadian rhythms, that influence E/E dynamics and user loyalty. The presented study emphasizes the importance of balancing E/E in online platform design, especially for live streaming platforms, providing implications that suggest design strategies for platform developers and content creators to facilitate timely engagement and retention.",

Drawing on participatory design workshops with 33 practitioners in both the technology industry and broader civil society, this research identifies significant structural misalignments between corporate incentives and public interests. While experts agree that successful content moderation is principled, consistent, contextual, proactive, transparent, and accountable, current technology companies fail to achieve these goals, due in part to exploitative labor practices, chronic underinvestment in user safety, and pressures of global scale. I argue that successful governance is undermined by the pursuit of technological novelty and rapid growth, resulting in platforms that necessarily prioritize innovation and expansion over public trust and safety. To counter this dynamic, I revisit the computational history of care work, to motivate present-day solidarity amongst platform governance workers and inspire systemic change.",

This report presents findings from a mixed-methods study of 660 Iranian internet users, with a focus on gamers as a digitally literate and socially networked community. Survey data are combined with network measurements of latency and VPN performance to identify both technical and social strategies of circumvention. Results show that while younger users report higher confidence with circumvention, peer networks, rather than formal training, are the strongest predictors of resilience. Gaming communities, particularly those active on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, serve as hubs for sharing tactics and lowering barriers to adoption. These findings extend existing work on usable security and censorship circumvention by highlighting the intersection of infrastructural conditions and social learning. The study concludes with design and policy implications for developers, researchers, and funders working on digital rights and information controls.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.09036v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Software developers face risks of leaking their software secrets, such as API keys or passwords, which can result in significant harm. Secret management tools (SMTs), such as HashiCorp Vault Secrets or Infisical, are highly recommended by industry, academia, and security guidelines to manage secrets securely. SMTs are designed to help developers secure their secrets in a central location, yet secrets leaks are still commonplace, and developers report difficulty in learning how to setup and use SMTs. While SMTs typically come with publicly available help resources (e.g., tool documentation and interfaces), it is unclear if these actually help developers learn to effectively use SMTs. Without usable help resources that onboards developers, quick adoption and effective use of SMTs may be unrealistic. In a qualitative two-step study, we observed 21 new users in person while they used SMTs to perform two secret management tasks: secret storage and access, then secret injection. We interviewed participants after each task to identify their challenges and experiences using SMTs, with the assistance of help resources. While our study sample is narrow, it serves as a reasonable proxy for new developers who are likely to adopt SMTs early in their careers. We found that even in a laboratory setting where new users found tool functionality, interface flexibility helpful, they still experienced increased difficulty to effectively use SMTs to securely remediate a hard-coded secret when they felt tool documentation was insufficient and it motivated participants to deviate from official tool documentation to access secondary sources or attempt workaround methods. Specific challenges reported by participants were tool documentation content quality, navigation difficulties with both tool documentation and web interfaces for finding helpful content, and supportive tool features.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.08997v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by teenagers and young adults in everyday life, ranging from emotional support and creative expression to educational assistance. However, their unique vulnerabilities and risk profiles remain under-examined in current safety benchmarks and moderation systems, leaving this population disproportionately exposed to harm. In this work, we present Youth AI Risk (YAIR), the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate and improve the safety of youth LLM interactions. YAIR consists of 12,449 annotated conversation snippets spanning 78 fine grained risk types, grounded in a taxonomy of youth specific harms such as grooming, boundary violation, identity confusion, and emotional overreliance. We systematically evaluate widely adopted moderation models on YAIR and find that existing approaches substantially underperform in detecting youth centered risks, often missing contextually subtle yet developmentally harmful interactions. To address these gaps, we introduce YouthSafe, a real-time risk detection model optimized for youth GenAI contexts. YouthSafe significantly outperforms prior systems across multiple metrics on risk detection and classification, offering a concrete step toward safer and more developmentally appropriate AI interactions for young users.",

Such an overview can enhance understanding of current practices, highlight distinguishing features among tools, and help identify future research directions, guiding designers in developing more accessible and effective authoring systems.

      "content": "arXiv:2509.08915v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In human-computer interaction applications like hand gesture recognition, supervised learning models are often trained on a large population of users to achieve high task accuracy. However, due to individual variability in sensor signals and user behavior, static models may not provide optimal performance for all users. Personalizing pretrained models via calibration--collecting labeled data from each user--can improve performance but introduces user friction and struggles with limited data. To overcome these issues, we propose a calibrationless longitudinal personalization method: a contextual multi-arm bandit (MAB) algorithm combined with a pretrained neural network for gesture recognition. This reinforcement-learning-style approach enables personalization using binary reward signals, either user-provided or inferred by the system.\n  We validated this method in a user study. Participants wore a surface electromyography (sEMG) device and played multiple rounds of a 2-D navigation game using six hand gestures. In the session, they completed a baseline round and then a round with our algorithm; in the second session, they played another round with our algorithm. Our approach led to a significant reduction in users' average false negative rate by 0.113 from the initial to the final round, with further decreases between sessions. Average precision also trended upward (by 0.139) from the start to end of a round, continuing in the next session. Notably, some users who could not complete the game with the baseline model succeeded with our contextual MAB model. In summary, our",

Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a \"thermodynamic uncertainty relation.\" We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.09152v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms such as Weights & Biases (W&amp;B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized), incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets, fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality high-performance predictive models of brain activity.\n  Project page: https://litcoder-brain.github.io",

      "content": "arXiv:2509.09213v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This study introduces a novel, flexible, and implantable neural probe using a cost-effective microfabrication process based on a thin polyimide film. Polyimide film, known as Kapton, serves as a flexible substrate for microelectrodes, conductive tracks, and contact pads of the probe, which are made from a thin film of gold (Au). SU-8 is used to cover the corresponding tracks for electrical isolation and to increase the stiffness of the probe for better implantation. To evaluate the performance of the fabricated probe, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and artificial neural signal recording have been used to characterize its properties. The microelectrode dimensions have been carefully chosen to provide low impedance characteristics, which are necessary for acquiring local field potential (LFP) signals. The in vivo LFP data have been obtained from a male zebra finch presented with auditory stimuli. By properly filtering the extracellular recordings and analyzing the data, the obtained results have been validated by comparing them with the signals acquired with a commercial neural electrode. Due to the use of Kapton, SU-8, and Au materials with non-toxic and adaptable properties in the body environment, the fabricated neural probe is considered a promising biocompatible implantable neural probe that may pave the way for the fabrication of other neural implantable devices with commercial aims.",

      "title": "Path to Intelligence: Measuring Similarity between Human Brain and Large Language Model Beyond Language Task",
      "content": "arXiv:2509.08831v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like abilities in language-based tasks. While language is a defining feature of human intelligence, it emerges from more fundamental neurophysical processes rather than constituting the basis of intelligence itself. In this work, we study the similarity between LLM internal states and human brain activity in a sensory-motor task rooted in anticipatory and visuospatial behavior. These abilities are essential for cognitive performance that constitute human intelligence. We translate the sensory-motor task into natural language in order to replicate the process for LLMs. We extract hidden states from pre-trained LLMs at key time steps and compare them to human intracranial EEG signals. Our results reveal that LLM-derived reactions can be linearly mapped onto human neural activity. These findings suggest that LLMs, with a simple natural language translation to make them understand temporal-relevant tasks, can approximate human neurophysical behavior in experiments involving sensory stimulants. In all, our contribution is two-fold: (1) We demonstrate similarity between LLM and human brain activity beyond language-based tasks. (2) We demonstrate that with such similarity, LLMs could help us understand human brains by enabling us to study topics in neuroscience that are otherwise challenging to tackle.",
