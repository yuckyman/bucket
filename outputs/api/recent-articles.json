      "title": "Degraded neural coding of temporal fine structure with age predicts effortful listening in multi-talker environments",
      "content": "Middle age represents a critical window for early detection of neurophysiological decline. Hearing loss is increasingly recognized as both an early marker of neural degeneration and a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Yet many adults report difficulty understanding speech in noise despite normal audiograms, highlighting the limitations of current clinical tests that fail to capture the underlying physiology or effort required for real-world listening. Beyond hearing thresholds, speech comprehension in complex environments depends on precise neural encoding of temporal fine structure (TFS) cues that convey pitch and spatial information. Here, we use a noninvasive EEG-based measure of neural phase-locking (frequency modulation following responses or FMFRs) to quantify TFS encoding in young and middle-aged adults with normal hearing thresholds. Middle-aged listeners exhibited reduced FMFR amplitudes and shallower discriminability slopes, reflecting diminished neural synchrony despite preserved hearing thresholds. Using a multi-talker speech task we further found that pupil-indexed listening effort was significantly greater in middle-aged adults despite matched accuracy across groups. Further, increases in listening effort were predicted by decreases in TFS encoding. Together, these results reveal that degraded neural encoding of TFS underlies subclinical listening difficulties and increased cognitive load, establishing the FMFR as a sensitive biomarker of hidden auditory neural decline.",

      "title": "Posterior Cortex Isolation Enhances Detection of Alpha Desynchronization During Sustained Attention",
      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential tool for assessing the neural activity behind mental fatigue, a factor that can influence both cognitive and physical performance. Mental fatigue influences alpha-band oscillations (8 to 12 Hz), reflecting cortical engagement and attention stability. In this study, EEG recordings from 109 participants in the Physionet open-source EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset (EEGMMIDB) were analyzed to characterize alpha power changes during sustained attention. Spectral analysis was performed across early and late task blocks to quantify alpha desynchronization over time. Participants demonstrated a consistent decrease in alpha power ( = -0.076 +/- 0.019 log10 units; p = 0.0001), indicating desynchronization associated with sustained attentional demand. These findings show the applicability of open-source EEG datasets for research. Furthermore, these findings support the isolation of posterior activation as a marker of mental fatigue through alpha desynchronization.",

      "title": "Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.",
      "content": "Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature\u2013category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature\u2013feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "content": "The emergence of functional sensory modalities requires precise cortical arealization and thalamocortical connectivity. While early morphogen gradients broadly initiate cortical patterning, how sensory identity is specified and refined within these territories remains unclear. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we reveal distinct modality-specific identity genes in primary somatosensory and visual cortices at early stages. These genes are enriched in thalamo-recipient layers and linked to neuronal activity and cell adhesion. Disrupting early thalamic activity alters both cortical activity and the expression of a subset of these genes, demonstrating a causal role for thalamic input in sensory modality acquisition. Remarkably, a core set of identity genes is already differentially expressed embryonically, before thalamic innervation, and encodes cell-adhesion profiles matching those of sensory thalamus, potentially enabling homophilic interactions. Our findings support a two-step model: cortical cell-adhesion codes prime modality-specific thalamocortical targeting, which is subsequently refined by patterned thalamic activity to establish functional cortical modalities.",

      "content": "Psilocybin induces profound alterations in consciousness, yet prevailing neural models often describe a monolithic change in brain connectivity that may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of the psychedelic state. To test the hypothesis of a composite neural state, this study applied a robust, data-driven framework, Connectome Independent Component Analysis (connICA) with multi-level resampling, to resting-state fMRI data from healthy volunteers. The analysis decomposed connectomes into statistically independent functional connectivity traits (\"FC-Traits\"), revealing a primary trait whose expression was significantly modulated by plasma psilocin concentration, providing a whole-cortical signature of the drug's physiological action. Crucially, a second, distinct trait was also isolated, which independently associated with impaired performance on a visual divergent thinking task. These findings demonstrate that the acute psilocybin state is a composite of co-occurring neural processes. This validates the application of a decompositional connectomic framework to move beyond global descriptions and successfully disentangle the specific neural patterns underlying distinct pharmacological and cognitive correlates.",

      "title": "Connecting the dots - Recognition of artificial and natural shapes relies on representing points of high information",
      "content": "Physiological and psychophysical evidence suggests that the visual system represents object outlines based on prominent curvature features, in particular regions of extreme curvature (such as convex maxima and concave minima). Curvature extrema often coincide with points of high information content (surprisal, in information-theoretic terms). However, this relationship is only correlational. To date, no study has directly compared the role of curvature extrema with the role of surprisal itself. Does the visual system selectively encode curvature extrema because they tend to be informative-because they are heuristic proxies for high-surprisal points along the contour-or does it directly encode informative points that happen often to be located at curvature extrema? We addressed this question in a series of shape-matching experiments, testing how curvature extrema and information content contribute to recognition. Observers (N = 7) matched a smooth test shape to one of two re-scaled shapes (target and distractor) constructed by connecting, with straight lines, points corresponding to (i) curvature maxima, (ii) both curvature maxima and minima, or (iii) points of maximum surprisal. A baseline condition used identical test and target shapes. Stimuli included artificial shapes composed of compound radial frequency patterns and natural shapes (animal outlines), the latter enabling us to disentangle curvature and information effects by restricting sampled points. Recognition performance was higher for natural than artificial shapes (95% vs. ~86%). Performance for shapes containing a few points of high information matched performance on trials containing all curvature extrema and baseline trials. It also exceeded performance for shapes with curvature maxima alone (65% vs. ~90%). These findings suggest that shape representation emphasizes features with high informational content rather than curvature extrema per se.",

Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

      "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "title": "Micro-/nano-plastics accentuate Parkinson's Disease-relevant phenotypes in a Drosophila model",
      "content": "Micro- and nano-plastic (MNP) particles are a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that are increasingly bioaccumulating in human tissues, particularly the brain. MNPs induce mitochondrial defects, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and neurotoxicity in cellular and organismal models. This raises the possibility that MNP exposure could cause or exacerbate neurological conditions associated with these pathological phenomena. Parkinson's Disease (PD), a common movement disorder characterised by degeneration of striatal dopaminergic neurons, and associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, represents such a condition. We therefore hypothesised that MNP exposure might interact with PD risk mutations affecting mitochondrial fidelity. We used a fruit fly model of PRKN-dependent PD associated with defects in mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control pathway, to test this hypothesis. We found that ingestion of MNPs at concentrations tolerated by wild-type controls selectively enhanced PD-relevant phenotypes - including progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, movement defects, and sleep disruption - in this model of PD. Our data suggest that defects in mitochondrial quality control can increase vulnerability to MNP exposure, and more broadly, that MNPs may synergistically interact with existing genetic risk factors to worsen neurological disease.",

      "title": "Insular error network enables self-correcting intracranial brain-computer interface",
      "content": "Error recognition is fundamental to adaptive behavior, enabling rapid compensatory action when outcomes deviate from expectations. Central to this function are neural circuits for performance monitoring, encoding cognitive signals that could support more reliable neural interfaces. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in epilepsy patients to enable a motor brain-computer interface (BCI) while sampling error-related activity across a distributed network. Our work reveals high-frequency population dynamics emerging in the anterior insula and propagating to the prefrontal cortex as the interface fails to follow the user's intention. We identify spatially organized insular responses to error processing and movement feedback, highlighting it as a heterogeneous hub linking action and outcome. Real-time integration of error responses enables a self-correcting neural interface that enhances usability by reducing the need for manual user intervention. Together, our work demonstrates a human intracranial BCI harnessing insular brain activity, integrating cognitive processes directly into device control.",
