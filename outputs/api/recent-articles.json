      "title": "Efficient and reproducible pipelines for spike sorting large-scale electrophysiology data",
      "content": "The scale of in vivo electrophysiology has expanded in recent years, with simultaneous recordings across thousands of electrodes now becoming routine. These advances have enabled a wide range of discoveries, but they also impose substantial computational demands. Spike sorting, the procedure that extracts spikes from extracellular voltage measurements, remains a major bottleneck: a dataset collected in a few hours can take days to spike sort on a single machine, and the field lacks rigorous validation of the many spike sorting algorithms and preprocessing steps that are in use. Advancing the speed and accuracy of spike sorting is essential to fully realize the potential of large-scale electrophysiology. Here, we present an end-to-end spike sorting pipeline that leverages parallelization to scale to large datasets. The same workflow can run reproducibly on individual workstations, high-performance computing clusters, or cloud environments, with computing resources tailored to each processing step to reduce costs and execution times. In addition, we introduce a benchmarking pipeline, also optimized for parallel processing, that enables systematic comparison of multiple sorting pipelines. Using this framework, we show that Kilosort4, a widely used spike sorting algorithm, outperforms Kilosort2.5 (Pachitariu et al. 2024). We also show that 7x lossy compression, which substantially reduces the cost of data storage, has minimal impact on spike sorting performance. Together, these pipelines address the urgent need for scalable and transparent spike sorting of electrophysiology data, reparing the field for the coming flood of multi-thousand-channel experiments.",

      "title": "Endosomal MrGPRX1 signaling sensitizes TRPV1 to enhance itch",
      "content": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and TRPV (transient receptor potential vanilloid) channels are crucial for signal transduction in physiological processes, including neurotransmission, pain, and itch. Downstream effectors of GPCR signaling can directly stimulate TRPV channels or enhance their sensitivity to stimuli, a process known as TRPV sensitization. Traditionally, GPCRs are activated at the cell surface by extracellular agonists, triggering signaling cascades. Recent evidence suggests GPCRs continue to signal from intracellular organelles. The human Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor X1 (MrGPRX1) is a GPCR expressed in primary sensory neurons involved in nociception and pruritus. Recent studies demonstrated how intracellular GPCR signaling regulates neuronal activity. However, there is no evidence characterizing MrGPRX1 trafficking or intracellular signaling. Herein, we characterized MrGPRX1 signaling within the endosomal network and its role in sensitizing TRPV1 channels to enhance itch signaling. Utilizing subcellular targeted biosensors, we demonstrated MrGPRX1 can traffic and signal from endosomes. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that MrGPRX1 internalizes following BAM8-22 stimulation. BRET assays revealed that MrGPRX1 activation induces Gq and {beta}-arrestin-1 recruitment to the plasma membrane and early endosomes. Inhibition of dynamin or clathrin blocked BAM8-22-induced MrGPRX1 endocytosis and decreased nuclear extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. Calcium signaling confirmed that MrGPRX1-mediated TRPV1 sensitization is mediated by protein kinase C and ERK activation. Our findings reveal a novel role for MrGPRX1 endosomal signaling in TRPV1 sensitization. Understanding the mechanisms of MrGPRX1 signaling offers valuable insights into differentiating between pain and itch pathways, aiding in the development of targeted therapies for chronic pain and persistent itch.",

      "title": "Slow waves generation and propagation in a model of brain lesions",
      "content": "Slow waves (SWs), the hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, reflect the periodic occurrence of transient silent periods in cortical neurons (Down states). During NREM, SWs and Down states physiologically disrupt large-scale network interactions. Since early EEG studies, SWs have also been observed in awake patients after brain injury. Emerging evidence indicates that these intrusions of sleep-like activity interfere with ongoing network activity and contribute to motor and cognitive deficits; yet, the mechanisms governing the generation and spread of post-lesional SWs remain unclear. Here, we extend a neural mass model of EEG to capture transitions between wake-like and sleep-like dynamics and embed it in connectome-based networks with virtual lesions. This model supports that local disfacilitation, topology-dependent propagation, and synchrony-dependent amplification throughout the connectome are sufficient to produce post-lesional SWs. These mechanisms reproduce the spatial gradients of post-lesional SWs seen in patients and identify actionable targets for neuromodulation and rehabilitation.",

      "title": "Characterization of mechanical tissue properties in post-mortem human brain using magnetic resonance elastography",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious health condition that can cause neurological dysfunction to varying degrees depending on the nature of the mechanical insult. In biomechanical studies of TBI under high loading conditions, post-mortem human subjects (PMHS) are often used since ethical concerns prohibit such experiments in living human subjects. Because PMHS brains undergo significant changes following death, it is important to understand the relationship between the mechanical properties of PMHS brain tissue and living tissue. In this study, we performed magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) on three PMHS specimens to estimate the material properties of the cadaveric brain, namely the storage modulus and the loss modulus, as well as the resulting shear stiffness and damping ratio. We also performed longitudinal MRE scans on one of the PMHS over the span of two months to investigate the evolution of tissue properties with post-mortem degradation. In comparison to in vivo subjects of age range 70-75 years, a substantially higher stiffness (mean: 5.96kPa) and lower damping ratio (mean: 0.09) were found in PMHS models. This study also revealed an initial increase in shear stiffness up to the seventh day post-mortem, followed by a steady decrease by the fifty-eighth day. However, the damping ratio displayed an opposite trend to that of shear stiffness. These changes were heterogeneous across brain regions. The collected measurements and analysis elucidate the changes in mechanical properties in post-mortem subjects, and can be used to build and validate computational models of TBI.",

      "title": "The neuroscience of highly stable, positive, and refined states of consciousness during jhana-type advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J)",
      "content": "Humans can experience a rich array of conscious experience, including highly stable, positive, and refined states of non-ordinary perception that can be elicited through advanced meditation. Here, we present the first group-level, ultra-high-field (7T) fMRI study of jhana advanced concentration absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We combined local (regional homogeneity), mesoscale (connectivity gradients), and global (geometric eigenmodes) human brain mapping with diverse and detailed phenomenology, meditative traits, behaviorally assessed cognitive functions, and extensive publicly available psychobehavioral affinity maps. Across eight successive states of ACAM-J, we observed reproducible neural trajectories marked by anterior-to-posterior reorganization, flattening of cortical hierarchies, nonlinear reconfiguration of global harmonics, and tight coupling between brain metrics and equanimity, attentional stability, and behavior. Neurosynth decoding further associate ACAM-J with reduced suffering-related processes and more with attentional monitoring. These findings suggest ACAM-J is a distinct, structured mode of awareness that persists despite radically reduced narrative thought and sensory content. Our findings also inform boundary conditions for current models of consciousness. More broadly, this research indicates that advanced meditation is a powerful framework for understanding psychological transformation, and for potential new opportunities for supporting human well-being and flourishing.",

      "title": "Show HN: DBOS Java \u2013 Postgres-Backed Durable Workflows",
      "content": "<p>Hi HN - I\u2019m Peter, here with Harry (devhawk), and we\u2019re building DBOS Java, an open-source Java library for durable workflows, backed by Postgres.<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-java\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/dbos-inc/dbos-transact-java</a><p>Essentially, DBOS helps you write long-lived, reliable code that can survive failures, restarts, and crashes without losing state or duplicating work. As your workflows run, it checkpoints each step they take in a Postgres database. When a process stops (fails, restarts, or crashes), your program can recover from those checkpoints to restore its exact state and continue from where it left off, as if nothing happened.<p>In practice, this makes it easier to build reliable systems for use cases like AI agents, payments, data synchronization, or anything that takes hours, days, or weeks to complete. Rather than bolting on ad-hoc retry logic and database checkpoints, durable workflows give you one consistent model for ensuring your programs can recover from any failure from exactly where they left off.<p>This library contains all you need to add durable workflows to your program: there's no separate service or orchestrator or any external dependencies except Postgres. Because it's just a library, you can incrementally add it to your projects, and it works out of the box with frameworks like Spring. And because it's built on Postgres, it natively supports all the tooling you're familiar with (backups, GUIs, CLI tools) and works with any Postgres provider.<p>If you want to try it out, check out the quickstart:<p><a href=\"https://docs.dbos.dev/quickstart?language=java\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.dbos.dev/quickstart?language=java</a><p>We'd love to hear what you think! We\u2019ll be in the comments for the rest of the day to answer any questions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45920156\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45920156</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Sudden restructuring of memory representations in recurrent neural networks with repeated stimulus presentations",
      "content": "While acquisition curves in human learning averaged at the group level display smooth, gradual changes in performance, individual learning curves across cognitive domains reveal sudden, discontinuous jumps in performance. Similar thresholding effects are a hallmark of a range of nonlinear systems which can be explored using simple, abstract models. Here, I investigate discontinuous changes in learning performance using Amari-Hopfield networks with Hebbian learning rules which are repeatedly exposed to a single stimulus. Simulations reveal that the attractor basin size for a target stimulus increases in discrete jumps rather than gradual changes with repeated stimulus exposure. The distribution of the size of these positive jumps in basin size is best approximated by a lognormal distribution, suggesting that the distribution is heavy-tailed. Examination of the transition graph structure for networks before and after basin size changes reveals that newly acquired states are often organized into hierarchically branching tree structures, and that the distribution of branch sizes is best approximated by a power law distribution. The findings suggest that even simple nonlinear network models of associative learning exhibit discontinuous changes in performance with repeated learning which mirror behavioral results observed in humans. Future work can investigate similar mechanisms in more biologically detailed network models, potentially offering insight into the network mechanisms of learning with repeated exposure or practice.",
