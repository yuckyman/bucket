      "title": "TSLNet: a hierarchical multi-head attention-enabled two-stream LSTM network for accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition",
      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "How are different contrast effects on binocular luster spatially integrated?",
      "content": "In previous studies with dichoptic center-ring-surround stimuli, we found that two properties of the ring element have a strong influence on the phenomenon of binocular luster. The strength of the lustrous impression in the central target patch varies with increasing ring width, with the direction of this variation (increasing or decreasing) depending on the ring's luminance. In this study, we used stimuli in which the ring was split into segments with two different luminances that in uniform rings had opposite effects on perceived luster. The aim was to investigate how the lustrous impression is influenced by combining a weaker and a stronger contrast effect, in particular how they are spatially integrated by the visual system. In a psychophysical matching experiment, subjects had to assess the strength of the lustrous impression in a series of test stimuli with different ring widths, numbers of ring segments, and spatial proportions between the two ring parts. We found that the results of the experiment could neither be explained by a winner-takes-all integration (assuming that the lustrous response is completely determined by the stronger effect) nor by a balanced integration process (assuming equal weights for the two effects). Instead, both effects contribute to the overall lustrous response, with the stronger effect having a greater weight. Interestingly, the magnitude of this weight varied considerably between different groups of subjects. We found two main trends in the data, representing two different types of sensitivity to the phenomenon of binocular luster.",

      "title": "From generative AI to the brain: five takeaways",
      "content": "The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modeling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.",
