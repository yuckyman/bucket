      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "title": "MMoGCN: a multi-gate mixture of graph convolutional network model for EEG emotion and mood disorder recognition",
      "content": "Objective. Emotional states and mood disorders are closely interconnected, and their joint recognition serves as a critical pathway to uncovering their intrinsic relationship. Currently, deep learning (DL) models based on electroencephalogram (EEG) have achieved significant progress in single tasks such as emotion recognition or mood disorder (MD) recognition. However, most existing models are limited to handling only one of these tasks independently and fail to effectively leverage the shared features in EEG data related to both emotions and mood disorders. This limitation hinders the in-depth exploration of the complex interplay between emotions and mood disorders. Therefore, this study aims to develop an EEG-based DL framework for the joint recognition of emotions and mood disorders, thereby providing a foundation for further investigation into their interaction. Approach. We design a multi-gate mixture-of-experts graph convolutional network model(MMoGCN) for joint emotion and MD recognition. MMoGCN comprises three key modules: (1) a feature extraction module based on differential entropy to robustly represent EEG signals; (2) a Multi-gated shared experts module, which integrates two experts, and combines them through a gating mechanism to extract shared representations across tasks; and (3) adaptive task-specific towers, which consist of individual classification towers for each task and incorporate an adaptive weighting loss function to dynamically adjust task contributions. MMoGCN is evaluated on a self-collected dataset and further validated on the public DEAP dataset. Main results. MMoGCN achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines in both emotion and MD recognition. Validation experiments on DEAP further demonstrate the scalability and generalization of MMoGCN. Significance. An effective multi-task learning model is proposed for joint emotion and MD recognition based on EEG. Additionally, the cognitive differences are also analyzed in emotional responses between healthy controls and subjects with mood disorders, providing methodological insights and potential assistance for cognitive rehabilitation from both cognitive and emotional perspectives.",

      "title": "Breaking the performance barrier in deep learning-based SSVEP-BCIs: a joint frequency-phase training strategy",
      "content": "Objective. Deep learning (DL) exhibits considerable potential for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) classification in electroencephalography-based brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs). SSVEP signals contain both frequency and phase characteristics that correspond to the visual stimuli. However, existing DL training strategies typically focus on either frequency or phase information alone, thus failing to fully exploit these dual inherent properties and substantially limiting classification accuracy. Approach. To tackle this limitation, this study proposes a joint frequency-phase training strategy (JFPTS), which comprises two complementary stages with distinct time-window sampling schemes. The first stage adopts a frequency prior-driven sampling scheme to improve frequency component utilization, whereas the second stage employs a phase-locked sampling scheme to enhance intra-category phase consistency. This design enables JFPTS to effectively leverage both frequency and phase properties of SSVEP signals. Main results. Comprehensive experiments on two well-established public datasets validate the effectiveness of JFPTS. The results demonstrate that the JFPTS-enhanced model achieves a marked superiority over the current state-of-the-art classification approaches, notably surpassing the long-standing performance benchmark set by task-discriminative component analysis (TDCA). Significance. Overall, JFPTS establishes a new training paradigm that advances DL approaches for SSVEP classification and promotes the broader adoption of SSVEP-BCIs.",
