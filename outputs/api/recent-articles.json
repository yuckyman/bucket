      "title": "AI-Guided Dual Strategy for Peptide Inhibitor Design Targeting Structural Polymorphs of \u03b1-Synuclein Fibrils",
      "content": "One of the most important events in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and related disorders is the formation of abnormal fibrils via the aggregation of -synuclein with {beta}-sheet-rich organization. The use of Cryo-EM has uncovered different polymorphs of the fibrils, each having unique structural interfaces, which has made the design of inhibitors even more challenging. Here, a structure-guided framework incorporating AI-assisted peptide generation was set up with the objective of targeting the conserved {beta}-sheet motifs that are present in various forms of -syn fibrils. The ProteinMPNN, then, AlphaFold-Multimer, and PepMLM were employed to create short peptides that would interfere with the growth of the fibrils. The two selected candidates, T1 and S1, showed a significant inhibition of -syn fibrillation, as measured by a decrease in the ThT fluorescence and the generation of either amorphous or fragmented aggregates. The inhibitory potency of the peptides was in line with the predicted interface energies. This research work illustrates that the integration of cryo-EM structural knowledge with the computational design method leads to the quick discovery of the wide-spectrum peptide inhibitors, which is a good strategy for the precision treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "title": "AAV11 mediates efficient retrograde trans-neuronal transduction of astrocytes",
      "content": "Understanding the mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate neural circuits is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying cognitive and behavioral abnormalities in psychiatric disorders and for exploring potential therapeutic or intervention strategies. Viral tracers are powerful vehicles for comprehending the complex relationship between neurons and astrocytes. Despite adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) based anterograde trans-neuronal tools have been successfully applied for identifying astrocytes connected with presynaptic neurons, analogous retrograde trans-neuronal tools for labeling astrocytes connected to postsynaptic neurons remain under development. Here, we first demonstrate that GfaABC1D promoter embedding AAV11 can transfer retrogradely from axons of postsynaptic neurons to astrocytes. Furthermore, we established an AAV11-based dual-viral recombination strategy for labeling astrocytes connected to specific postsynaptic neurons. Finally, by employing targeted neuronal ablation technology to ablate neurons in a specific brain region, we observed that injection of AAV11 into the downstream brain region of this targeted area exhibited minimal labeling of astrocytes functionally associated with the ablated neurons. This finding indicates that AAV11 holds utility for deciphering pathological alterations in disease-related astrocyte-neuron connectivity networks. This work fills a key gap in tools used for studying astrocyte-neuron connectivity networks.",

      "title": "Distinct Filament Conformation for Receptor-Bound Amyloid-\u03b2 from Alzheimers Disease Brain",
      "content": "Alzheimers disease is triggered by amyloid-{beta}, with symptoms linked to synapse loss. Oligomeric amyloid-{beta}, rather than monomeric or fibrillar amyloid-{beta}, has been proposed to be the proximate mechanistic cause, but the relevant molecular characteristics have remained unclear. Here, we define a distinct receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} pool in Alzheimers brain by release with a receptor antagonist and purification to homogeneity. Receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} is ten times more abundant than free unbound amyloid-{beta}. The amyloid-{beta} associated with receptor is composed of 65 nm long filaments with prion protein binding at its tips. There is no evidence for an oligomeric A{beta} state interacting with human brain receptors. Cryo-electron microscopy shows two symmetric S-shaped monomers per filament rung. The tilt between rung monomers, twist along the filament axis, amino terminal conformation and amyloid seeding properties distinguish this structure from plaque-associated amyloid-{beta} filaments of the same brain. High tip:length ratio is critical for prion protein receptor interaction and synaptic damage. Characterizing receptor-bound amyloid-{beta} filament provides insight into neuronal dysfunction separate from plaque aggregation.",

      "title": "A cluster of three snoRNAs including jouvence required in the gut determines lifespan and confers neuroprotection through metabolic parameters",
      "content": "In our society, the aging of the population is a major concern of public health. Recently we have identified a new snoRNA (jouvence) in Drosophila, and showed that its deletion (F4) reduces lifespan, while its overexpression increases it. F4 deleted flies also present neurodegenerative lesions and a deregulation of metabolic parameters as triglycerides and sterol. However, a deeper characterization of this genomic locus has revealed the presence of two other snoRNAs. Here, we have characterized at the whole organismal level, the role of each them. First, we show that each snoRNAs are expressed in the epithelium of the gut (enterocytes), and in the fat body. Second, in F4 deletion, the re-expression of each snoRNA in the enterocytes or in the fat body is sufficient to improve lifespan, and protect against neurodegeneration in old flies. In addition, depending of the snoRNAs, it rescues the expression of specific deregulated genes within the epithelium of the gut, involved in lipids and sterol metabolism. Consequently, these two metabolic parameters are also rescued, establishing a relationship between the lesions of the brain, the metabolic disorders, the lifespan, and each snoRNAs respectively. Finally, histological stainings as Nile Red and BODIPY C11-581/591 have revealed that the neurodegenerative lesions are due to an increase of free sterol within the brain, and lipid peroxydation in the pericerebral fat body. Altogether, these results point-out a causal relationship between the epithelium of the gut and the neurodegenerative lesions through the metabolic parameters, indicating a gut-brain axis.",
