      "title": "Comparison of the reticulospinal drive to lumbar erector spinae muscles in postural and voluntary tasks using the StartReact paradigm",
      "content": "IntroductionWhile lesion and neurophysiological animal studies point toward a notable involvement of subcortical pathways in the control of low back muscles, little attention has been dedicated to the subject in humans. The StartReact paradigm may allow to indirectly test the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system during motor control, thus addressing this gap of knowledge. In this study, we aimed to compare the potential contribution of the reticulospinal system in the control of low back muscles during voluntary (lumbar spine extension) and postural (upper limb movement eliciting anticipatory postural adjustment) tasks using the StartReact paradigm.MethodsThe reaction time (RT) of the lumbar erector spinae was measured within a simple precued RT task while conditioned by startling (SAS\u2014116\u202fdB) or non-startling (NSAS\u201480\u202fdB) acoustic stimuli.ResultsThe reduction in RT was similar during the postural and voluntary tasks. However, RT was more shortened with the SAS condition compared to the NSAS condition in both tasks. This finding was replicated using a cumulative distribution functions analysis.DiscussionFor the first time, a StartReact effect of back muscles was demonstrated during a voluntary task and was shown to be similar to that observed in a postural task. Therefore, these results suggest a contribution of the reticulospinal tract in the postural and voluntary control of back muscles in humans.",

      "title": "Association between neuroticism and physical activity: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundPhysical activity has been shown to be associated with neuroticism, a personality trait reflecting emotional instability and a tendency toward negative emotions. Understanding this relationship is crucial for developing effective mental health interventions. However, the underlying mechanisms and the strength of this association remain insufficiently understood.ObjectiveThis systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the current research on the relationship between neuroticism and physical activity, analyze their correlations and moderating factors, and investigate the potential bidirectional mechanisms linking these two factors.MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive search of Web of Science, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and EBSCOhost for studies published between January 2000 and November 2024. We included English-language studies across all age groups that employed cross-sectional, longitudinal, or cohort designs. Studies focusing on special populations, non-peer-reviewed works, samples with fewer than 50 participants, non-empirical studies, and reviews were excluded. Data extraction was performed using standardized forms, and a meta-analysis was conducted in Stata 18 to assess heterogeneity and publication bias.ResultsAfter screening, 25 studies were included, comprising 15 Pearson correlation analyses and 12 multiple regression analyses. The meta-analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between physical activity and neuroticism, with an average correlation coefficient r = \u22120.141. This suggests that higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower levels of neuroticism. Specifically, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for neuroticism inhibiting physical activity was \u22120.150, indicating that for every one standard deviation increase in neuroticism, physical activity decreases by approximately 0.150 standard deviation units. Conversely, the average standardized coefficient \u03b2 for physical activity affecting neuroticism was \u22120.113, suggesting a potential reduction in neuroticism with increased physical activity, although this effect was not statistically significant across the limited number of studies.ConclusionOur findings confirm a significant negative association between physical activity and neuroticism, highlighting the potential of physical activity as a strategy for improving mental health. However, establishing causality requires further verification through longitudinal and experimental designs. The results emphasize the need for personalized interventions targeting individuals with high neuroticism. Future research should prioritize diverse cultural samples, standardized measurement protocols, and mechanistic investigations of this bidirectional relationship to better understand the underlying processes and develop effective interventions.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251051360, identifier: CRD420251051360.",

      "title": "Case Report: Implementation of stereoelectroencephalography in Kazakhstan: early experience in surgical planning for drug-resistant epilepsy",
      "content": "IntroductionThis clinical report describes the management of a 32-year-old patient with a long-standing history of drug-resistant epilepsy. It uniquely illustrates how stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) played a significant role in the presurgical evaluation of a multifocal epileptic disorder which, despite a long history of no changes on MRI, was ultimately found to be associated with bilateral hippocampal sclerosis. This is one of the first documented cases of SEEG application in Kazakhstan, where the method was introduced in 2024.Clinical presentation and diagnostic findingsThe patient suffered from debilitating seizures (4\u20136 times/week, often in series of 3-4/day) refractory to combined antiepileptic therapy. Scalp EEG revealed the first originating from the right frontotemporal leads with subsequent diffuse, predominantly right-sided, propagation. The second seizure, however, showed onset from the left temporal leads; notably, only left-onset seizures culminated in bilateral synchronization. Financial constraints precluding PET-CT and the diagnostic ambiguity of routine methods necessitated invasive SEEG.SEEG results and therapeutic strategySEEG monitoring unequivocally identified three independent epileptogenic foci: in the right hippocampus, left hippocampus, and left orbitofrontal region. Such multifocal pathology significantly reduces the likelihood of successful focal resection. Despite this inherent complexity, a crucial clinical outcome was achieved: the patient has remained completely seizure-free for 7\u202fmonths following the ANT-DBS procedure.ConclusionThis report underscores the critical role of SEEG in the precise localization and characterization of complex, multifocal epileptogenic networks, often elusive to non-invasive modalities. It convincingly demonstrates that a comprehensive invasive approach can lead to successful seizure control even in cases previously considered inoperable. It also reflects the challenges and advancements in developing high-tech epileptological care in regions where advanced methods like SEEG have only recently been introduced.",

      "title": "Dynamic graph neural networks for UAV-based group activity recognition in structured team sports",
      "content": "IntroductionUnderstanding group actions in real-world settings is essential for the advancement of applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems. Group activity recognition, particularly in sports scenarios, presents unique challenges due to dynamic interactions, occlusions, and varying viewpoints. To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning system that recognizes multi-person behaviors by integrating appearance-based features (HOG, LBP, SIFT), skeletal data (MediaPipe, MOCON), and motion features. Our approach employs a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN) and Bi-LSTM architecture, enabling robust recognition of group activities in diverse and dynamic environments. To further validate our framework\u2019s adaptability, we include evaluations on Volleyball and SoccerTrack UAV-recorded datasets, which offer unique perspectives and challenges.MethodOur framework integrates YOLOv11 for object detection and SORT for tracking to extract multi-modal features\u2014including HOG, LBP, SIFT, skeletal data (MediaPipe), and motion context (MOCON). These features are optimized using genetic algorithms and fused within a Dynamic Graph Neural Network (DGNN), which models players as nodes in a spatio-temporal graph, effectively capturing both spatial formations and temporal dynamics.ResultsWe evaluated our framework on three datasets: a volleyball dataset, SoccerTrack UAV-based soccer dataset, and NBA basketball dataset. Our system achieved 94.5% accuracy on the volleyball dataset (mAP: 94.2%, MPCA: 93.8%) with an inference time of 0.18\u202fs per frame. On the SoccerTrack UAV dataset, accuracy was 91.8% (mAP: 91.5%, MPCA: 90.5%) with 0.20\u202fs inference, and on the NBA basketball dataset, it was 91.1% (mAP: 90.8%, MPCA: 89.8%) with the same 0.20\u202fs per frame. These results highlight our framework\u2019s high performance and efficient computational efficiency across various sports and perspectives.DiscussionOur approach demonstrates robust performance in recognizing multi-person actions across diverse conditions, highlighting its adaptability to both conventional and UAV-based video sources.",

      "content": "We present an extension to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) for motion data. Motion data is frequently recorded alongside human brain imaging and electrophysiological data. The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of...",

      "content": "Freezing of gait, characterized by involuntary interruptions of walking, is a debilitating motor symptom of Parkinson's disease that restricts people's autonomy. Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate cortical haemodynamics related to...",

      "content": "Motor cortical high-gamma oscillations (60-90 Hz) occur at movement onset and are spatially focused over the contralateral primary motor cortex. Although high-gamma oscillations are widely recognized for their significance in human motor control, their precise function on a cortical level remains elusive. Importantly, their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown. Because motor deficits are fundamental determinants of symptom burden after stroke, understanding the neurophysiological...",
