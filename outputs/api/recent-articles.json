      "title": "Neural Decoding of Musical Engagement Reveals Tension-Release Dynamics",
      "content": "Music listening is one of the most compelling and rewarding activities humans engage in spontaneously. But what exactly catches people's attention when listening to music remains unclear. Musicologists have argued that tension-release dynamics in music constitute crucial features of the listening experience. They arise from the intertwining of different low-level and high-level features and sit at the core of music enjoyment by engaging listeners dynamically. This study aims to characterize the relationship between tension dynamics and engagement during naturalistic music listening. Using canonical correlation analysis, we decoded the music envelope from EEG and ECoG responses and found that musical tension patterns, as reported by listeners, were predictive of fluctuations in the coupling between the music and the neural response. Importantly, tension dynamics were significantly correlated with neural measures of envelope tracking even after controlling for loudness and musical expectations, confirming the specific and crucial role of musical tension in engaging listeners. These results shed new light on how musical structure gives rise to internal response modulations that, in turn, dynamically reflect musical engagement. This interplay may underlie the pervasive and emotionally rewarding nature of music.",

      "title": "Non-focal beta oscillation suppression along the sensorimotor cortex revealed by corticomuscular coherence",
      "content": "An Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) of the 13-30 Hz sensorimotor (SM1) beta oscillations is commonly observed during movement preparation and execution. Human electrophysiological measurements suggest that such a beta ERD has a wide topographical distribution along the SM1, however, no accessible means of quantifying the degree of its focality exist. Therefore, we investigated how the movement-induced beta ERD in one somatotopic SM1 area affects beta oscillations in a neighbouring SM1 area. Thirty-six participants performed right brachium movements while holding a submaximal isometric contraction with their right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle. Beta ERD in the left SM1 brachium area was assessed with electroencephalography (EEG). The effect of that ERD on beta activity in the neighbouring SM1 FDI area was assessed through the corticomuscular coherence (CMC) between SM1 EEG signals and the electromyographic and force signals recorded from the contracted right FDI muscle. Our results showed that the strong movement-induced beta ERD in the SM1 brachium area spreads to the neighbouring SM1 FDI area and suppresses beta oscillations therein, as evidenced by significantly attenuated CMC with both FDI signals. These findings confirm that beta ERD is not a strictly focal phenomenon as it spreads to a neighbouring SM1 area. Importantly, we introduced a novel approach that combines a dual motor task paradigm with CMC to assess beta propagatory effects. This approach could allow for investigating the topographical properties of beta oscillations and their role for motor control in healthy and clinical populations.",

      "title": "Evolution of Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography on the European Synchrotron beamlines BM05 and BM18: a whole adult human brain imaging case study",
      "content": "Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) was recently developed to enable the ex-vivo imaging of human organs at multiple scales from whole organ down to cellular level. Using whole adult human brain imaging as a case study, this manuscript shows the evolution of this technique from its initial development at the BM05 beamline to its transition and current status at BM18. Thanks to the higher coherence, larger beam size, higher energies and larger propagation distances available at BM18 and due to the European Synchrotron's Extremely Brilliant Source upgrade (ESRF-EBS), this transition resulted in significantly improved data quality, resolution, sensitivity and speed. More recently, the implementation of a new generation of larger sCMOS cameras, helical scanning (including dedicated reconstruction algorithm developments), binning at the chip and projections levels, and the design of high-efficiency optics allowed to progressively improve the trade-off between dose and image quality, while simultaneously reducing scanning times. All these acquisition schemes present the current status of full organ imaging using HiP-CT and represent the constant efforts for the improvement of the technique towards the investigation of human organs in health, disease and aging.",

      "title": "Experience Reorganizes Coordinated Population Dynamics Across Hippocampal Circuits",
      "content": "Hippocampal function relies on structured patterns of population activity that reflect the intrinsic organization of the circuit. Although experience is known to influence synaptic properties and local activity features, whether prolonged experience reshapes the large-scale organization of population dynamics across hippocampal subfields in the intact brain has remained unclear. Progress on this question has been limited by the lack of measurements that capture circuit-wide activity simultaneously while preserving spatial circuit structure. Here, we combined prolonged environmental experience with large-scale, simultaneous multi-shank recordings spanning CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus in the mouse hippocampus to examine experience-dependent changes in circuit dynamics. We find that long-term experience reorganizes the basal operating state of the hippocampus, altering the statistical structure of field potentials, population spiking, and sharp-wave ripple activity in a coordinated manner across subfields. These changes are not confined to specific regions but instead reflect a circuit-wide reconfiguration of functional interactions that extends over larger spatial scales. At the population level, experience shifts hippocampal dynamics into a more coordinated dynamical regime, characterized by shared low-dimensional structure across hippocampal subfields. Together, these findings demonstrate that long-term experience reorganizes coordinated population dynamics across hippocampal circuits, establishing an intrinsic activity organization that reflects the experiential history of a memory network.",

      "title": "Decoding semantic categories: insights from an fMRI ALE meta analysis",
      "content": "Objective. The human brain organizes conceptual knowledge into semantic categories; however, the extent to which these categories share common or distinct neural representations remains unclear. This study aims to clarify this organizational structure by identifying consistent, modality-controlled activation patterns across several widely used and frequently investigated semantic domains in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) research. By quantifying the distinctiveness and overlap among these patterns, we provide a more precise foundation for understanding the brain\u2019s semantic architecture, as well as for applications such as semantic brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCI). Approach. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 75 fMRI studies covering six semantic categories: animals, tools, food, music, body parts, and pain. Using activation likelihood estimation, we identified convergent activation patterns for each category while controlling for stimulus modality (visual, auditory, tactile, and written). Subsequently, Jaccard-based overlap analyses were performed to quantify the degree of neural commonality and separability across concept-modality pairs, thereby revealing the underlying structure of representational similarity. Main results. Distinct yet partially overlapping activation networks were identified for each semantic category. Tools and animals showed shared activity in the lateral occipital and ventral temporal regions, reflecting common object-based visual processing. In contrast, food-related stimuli primarily recruited limbic and subcortical structures associated with affective and motivational processing. Music and animal sounds overlapped within the superior temporal and insular cortices, whereas body parts and pain engaged occipito-parietal and cingulo-insular networks, respectively. Together, these findings reveal a hierarchically organized and modality-dependent semantic architecture in the human brain. Significance. This meta-analysis offers a quantitative and integrative characterization of how semantic knowledge is distributed and differentiated across cortical systems. By demonstrating how conceptual content and sensory modality jointly shape neural organization, the study refines theoretical models of semantic cognition and provides a methodological basis for evaluating conceptual separability. These insights have direct implications for semantic neural decoding and for the development of BCI systems grounded in meaning-based neural representations.",

      "title": "Self-organized Recovery of Coordinated Locomotion in Crickets Revealed by Prosthetic Limb Integration",
      "content": "Distributed sensorimotor interactions facilitate the coordination of multilegged locomotion in insects without centralized control, yet the mechanisms that allow coordinated locomotion to re-emerge following limb loss remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the effects of leg amputation and the integration of prosthetic legs on walking coordination in crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus). Spherical treadmill experiments revealed that leg amputation disrupts inter-leg phase coupling, decreases locomotor speed, and alters spatial foot placement in a state-dependent manner, indicating impaired load-mediated coordination. Prosthetic legs did not merely restore intact kinematics; instead, they selectively reinstated coherent temporal coordination and axis-specific spatial organization. This structured recovery illustrates that re-introducing mechanically relevant sensory constraints is sufficient to re-engage distributed coordination networks, even in the absence of anatomical integrity. Our findings elucidate an embodied principle through which sensory-mechanical feedback facilitates the self-organization of resilient multi-legged locomotion in the context of morphological interventions.",

      "title": "Microstate-specific functional connectivity in alcohol use disorder using resting-state EEG",
      "content": "Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is often described as a \"disconnection syndrome\", reflecting neural dysfunction associated with chronic alcohol use. However, previous studies on functional connectivity of resting-state EEG (rsEEG) in AUD have reported inconsistent findings -- some showing hyperconnectivity, others hypoconnectivity or no significant differences -- possibly due to overlooking the brain's dynamic nature even at its resting state. Here, we examined rsEEG in 26 young adults with AUD and 35 healthy controls (HC), using microstate analysis to characterize transient brain states and to estimate functional connectivity within each state. We showed that microstate map topologies were comparable between the two groups. However, the temporal dynamics in the AUD group were biased toward microstates C and D, characterized by anterior-to-posterior configurations, within which between-channel functional connectivity differed from that of HC. Particularly within microstate C, the AUD group showed significantly reduced functional connectivity compared to the HC group in the majority of channel pairs. Moreover, compared with conventional functional connectivity estimates, microstate-specific functional connectivity yielded superior classification performance in distinguishing individuals with AUD from HC. Subsequent computation of graph-theoretical measures revealed that individuals with AUD showed less stable hub-like properties and reduced small-worldness in microstate C, indicating diminished network efficiency. Our findings suggest that transient EEG properties, exemplified by microstate-specific functional connectivity, provide informative neural markers for characterizing the impact of alcohol use on the brain.",

      "title": "Vocal production differentially affects fast- and broad-spiking neurons in auditory cortex",
      "content": "Vocalization, foundational for information exchange in animals, is supported by vocalization-modulated neurons that occur across species and brain areas. These neurons are typically studied in an undifferentiated manner, despite the heterogeneous nature of the cortical circuitry regarding cell types. Overlooking this diversity risks producing incomplete models of cortical function. Here, we address this challenge by studying large-scale, cell-type specific auditory cortical activity during vocalization in the bat Carollia perspicillata, a vocal specialist. We discovered that vocalisation-related modulatory effects in the auditory cortex, a critical attribute of the underlying circuit, differ starkly between putative inhibitory and pyramidal neurons. During calling, novel cell assemblies and temporal spiking patterns emerge wherein inhibitory cells play a pivotal role. Further, vocalization-specific neural decorrelations affect inhibitory cells most strongly. Together, these results demonstrate that vocalization-related neuronal activity is cell-type specific at the single- and multi-cellular levels of cortical organisation and highlight the importance of inhibitory neurons for auditory cortical dynamics during vocal production.",

      "title": "Causal Evidence for Left DLPFC Contributions to Working Memory, Attention, and Cognitive Control in Ageing: A cTBS/ERP Study",
      "content": "Ageing is characterised by progressive neurodegeneration and marked declines in working memory (WM), a domain critically dependent on the integrity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Although non-invasive brain stimulation is widely used to target this region, the causal contribution of the DLPFC to WM performance in older adults remains insufficiently understood. Here, we applied continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) to transiently inhibit the left DLPFC in twenty healthy older adults and assessed the behavioural and neurophysiological consequences during verbal and visuospatial N-back tasks. Behaviourally, moderate learning effects emerged exclusively in the verbal task following vertex stimulation, whereas learning after DLPFC stimulation remained inconclusive. Performance in the visuospatial task showed no reliable evidence of learning across conditions, consistent with greater interindividual variability and age-related decline in spatial WM. Neurophysiologically, ERP amplitudes were stable across conditions; however, marked latency perturbations were observed. In the verbal task, P200 and N200 latencies robustly predicted performance, with P200 latency significantly prolonged after DLPFC inhibition, indicating disrupted early attentional gating. N200 and P300 latency modulations further suggested load-dependent compensatory strategies, reflecting adaptive slowing of cognitive control processes. In contrast, visuospatial performance was not reliably predicted by P200 latency, although N200 and P300 latencies remained informative, indicating domain-specific differences in DLPFC involvement. Taken together, these findings provide causal evidence that left DLPFC disruption selectively interferes with the temporal coordination of verbal WM, emphasising the central role of processing speed and compensatory dynamics in cognitive ageing. ERP latency markers emerge as sensitive indices of subtle stimulation-induced perturbations in older adults.",

      "title": "Transmembrane PhoxID: Photo-proximity labelling across the plasma membrane",
      "content": "Transmembrane proteins perform essential roles in cellular transport, signalling, and communication. The function and dynamics of these proteins are precisely regulated by interactions on both sides of the plasma membrane; thus, mapping the composition of these interactomes is a fundamental challenge in molecular biology. Proximity labelling methods are powerful tools for this purpose; however, existing approaches that rely on membrane-impermeable reactive species are limited by the ability to detect only one side, either the extracellular or the intracellular region, of transmembrane proteins. Here, we capitalized on the cell permeability of singlet oxygen to carry out proximity labelling of the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane proteins using an extracellularly anchored photosensitizer. We applied this method, termed transmembrane PhoxID (tmPhoxID), to several receptors (GRID2, GABAAR, and GRM1) in the living mouse brain and successfully determined their specific intracellular interactomes. Notably, network analysis of the identified proteins revealed that this method can characterize the native components of transsynaptic nanocolumns formed at parallel fibre-Purkinje cell synapses. Furthermore, our study revealed a previously uncharacterized GABAAR-CAMKV interaction in mice and human brains. Our results provide a proof of concept for transmembrane and transcellular proximity labelling, providing a powerful platform for analysing the interactome of transmembrane proteins.",

      "title": "Synaptic vesicle undocking induces low frequency depression",
      "content": "Synaptic depression is often interpreted as reflecting depletion of the readily releasable pool (RRP) following exocytosis. Such a mechanism predicts little or no depression at low stimulation frequency, as RRP replenishment should then offset the loss of vesicles by exocytosis. Nevertheless, in several types of mammalian central synapses, repetitive presynaptic stimulation at low frequency (< 5 Hz) elicits synaptic depression (low frequency depression, or LFD). In the present work we count the number of synaptic vesicles released at individual active zones to study the RRP and its replenishment during LFD. Contrary to depletion models of synaptic depression, we find that LFD does not depend on previous SV consumption. We find that LFD displays a long recovery time course (tens of seconds) when challenged by isolated stimulations but is immediately reversed by a high frequency train. We suggest that LFD results from undocking, a shift between two classes of synaptic vesicles organized sequentially inside the RRP (replacement vs. docked vesicles) in favor of the upstream (replacement) state. While undocking is apparent hundreds of milliseconds after a stimulation, calcium dependent docking takes only a couple of milliseconds, explaining the fast LFD recovery when stimulating at high frequency. Consistent with the undocking model, we find that double presynaptic stimulations alleviate LFD as they favor vesicular docking and RRP replenishment. Finally, we expand our model to explain how stimulation frequency shapes short-term synaptic depression, changing from depression at low frequency to a facilitation-depression sequence at medium or high frequency trains.",
