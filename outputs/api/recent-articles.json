      "title": "Population-level temporal decoding and dynamical structure in frontostriatal circuits during decision making",
      "content": "Perceptual decisions unfold over time, requiring neural circuits to evaluate sensory evidence, track elapsed time, and commit to an action. To investigate how these computations are distributed across corticostriatal circuits, we recorded neural population activity using Neuropixels probes in the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during a free-response auditory change detection task. Both regions exhibited interesting dynamical properties during task performance. Using single-trial population decoding, we found that both FOF and ADS robustly encoded retrospective time from stimulus onset and prospective time preceding the decision report. Using a new approach to analyze temporal encoding to identify the dynamical structure supporting decoding, we found that time encoding could be decomposed into two primary dynamical motifs: monotonic ramp-like trajectories and transient bump-like trajectories. While these modes were similarly expressed during early evidence evaluation, FOF exhibited more pronounced decision-aligned changes near the time of the decision report, possibly reflecting a state transition at commitment. Population geometry analyses further revealed stable low-dimensional subspaces during evidence evaluation that transitioned at decision commitment, with significantly larger subspace changes in FOF than ADS. Together, these results demonstrate that FOF and ADS share common dynamical features during evidence evaluation but diverge near the time of decision commitment, with FOF exhibiting stronger state-transition dynamics.",

      "title": "Cell surface markers identify astrocyte subpopulations in the adult hippocampus with a heterogeneous response to aging",
      "content": "Astrocyte diversity is currently expanding both between and within specific brain regions. Here, we assessed the spatial distribution and transcriptomic profile of two hippocampal astrocyte subpopulations, defined by combinatorial expression of the cell surface astrocyte markers ACSA-1 or GLAST/SLC1A3, and ACSA-2 or ATP1B2. Fluorescence activated cell sorting and genome-wide transcriptomics by bulk RNAseq uncovered distinct transcriptional signatures of the two astrocyte subsets and highlighted heterogeneous responses during aging. The most abundant ATP1B2/GLAST double-positive astrocytes corresponded to mature glial cells with increased protein glycosylation and stable gene expression patterns. Signatures related to mitochondrial respiration and cholesterol metabolism were induced during aging in ATP1B2 single-positive astrocytes, while cell adhesion genes from the {gamma}-protocadherin cluster were repressed in double-positive astrocytes. Heterochronic co-culture assays with primary neurons show the loss of synaptogenic function of old ATP1B2/GLAST astrocytes. Our results complement previous studies demonstrating the presence of morphological and molecular astrocyte heterogeneity within the hippocampus, and uncover differences among astrocyte subsets in their transcriptomic response to aging.",

      "title": "Sensory processing reformats odor coding around valence and dynamics",
      "content": "Extracting relevant features of a complex sensory signal typically involves sequential processing through multiple brain regions. However, identifying the logic and mechanisms of these transformations has been difficult, due to the challenges of measuring both activity within and long-range connectivity between multiple neural populations. Here, we investigate the reformatting of odor information across two stages of the Drosophila olfac-tory system. We measure the odor tuning of 20 types of anatomically-defined third order lateral horn neuron (LHN) and compare to predictions based on the odor tuning of second-order projection neurons (PNs) and PN-LHN connectivity. We find that LHNs reformat PN activity in two distinct ways. First, LHNs selectively discard in-formation about odor identities with similar valence (i.e., attractiveness or aversiveness). This emerges from a precise alignment of PN odor tuning and PN-LHN connectivity, as well as odor-specific inhibition and boosting of LHN activity. This creates a population code for valence that is more explicit than in PNs. Second, a subset of LHNs selectively discard information about continuing odor presence, by responding only transiently to odor on-set. This creates a population code for odor dynamics that is more explicit than in PNs. Across LHNs, valence and dynamics are independent of each other. Thus, feedforward connectivity and local inhibition combine to ex-tract two orthogonal dimensions of olfactory information.",

      "title": "Intrinsic ion dynamics underlies the temporal nature of resting-state functional connectivity",
      "content": "The neural mechanisms underlying the emergence of functional connectivity in resting-state fMRI remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that resting-state activity consists of brief periods of strong co-fluctuations among brain regions, which reflect overall functional connectivity. Others report a continuum in co-fluctuations over time, with varying degree of correlation to functional connectivity. These findings raise the critical question: what neural processes underlie the temporal structure of resting-state activity? To address this, we used a biophysically realistic whole-brain computational model in which resting-state activity emerged from temporal variations in the ion concentrations of potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+), intracellular chloride (Cl-), and the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase. The model reproduced transient periods of high co-fluctuations, and the functional connectivity at different co-fluctuation levels correlated to varying degrees with the connectivity measured over the entire simulation, in line with experimental observations. The periods of high co-fluctuations were aligned with large changes in extracellular ion concentrations. Furthermore, critical parameters governing ion dynamics strongly affected both the timing of these transient events and the spatial structure of the resulting functional connectivity. The balance of excitatory and inhibitory activity further modulated their frequency and amplitude. Together, these results suggest that intrinsic fluctuations in ion dynamics could serve as a plausible neural mechanism for the temporal organization of co-fluctuations and resting-state functional connectivity.",

      "title": "Neural manifolds that orchestrate walking and stopping",
      "content": "Walking, stopping and maintaining posture are essential motor behaviors, yet the underlying neural processes remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate neural activity behind locomotion and its walk-to-stop transition. Based on a new theory of the lumbar spinal cord(1, 2) we propose and predict that spinal population activity contains limit cycle dynamics to drive walking and fixed-point attractors for stopping. To test these predictions we record neural activity in lumbar cord of freely moving rats using Neuropixels probes(3). To control stopping, we also stimulate a brainstem nucleus, known to induce motor arrest(4-7). We find: During locomotion, the population activity of lumbar spinal neurons exhibits rotational dynamics(8-10). These dynamics unfold within a low-dimensional locomotor manifold(11), a looping trajectory that serves as the repeating signature of locomotion, that also behaves as a limit-cycle attractor. Shortly before stopping, the neural state rapidly changes from the locomotor manifold to a \"postural\" fixed point attractor. When testing the stability of the fixed point using perturbations, the state shifts to a nearby albeit different fixed point. Repeated stoppings form a local quasi-continuum of fixed points representing various poses - i.e. a postural manifold. These observations are in agreement with our theory, which further indicates mechanistic roles for subpopulations of spinal interneurons for controlling walking and stopping. Besides explaining the data, our theory makes further predictions to be tested in future experiments.",

      "content": "Loss of striatal interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV+) is associated with impulsive and uncontrolled behaviors, yet how these cells contribute to striatal information processing is poorly understood. We compared spiking of five identified neuron types in sensorimotor striatum, as unrestrained rats waited for a cue then performed brief, well-practiced actions. During waiting PV+ selectively increased firing, and their suppression increased premature movements. This indicated a role restraining actions, yet PV+ suppression during the cue instead retarded actions. Each action was accompanied by a rapid sequence of spiny projection neuron (SPN) spiking, including both direct and indirect pathways and overlaid by sequential PV+ firing. Pairs of PV+ and SPNs showed millisecond-level synchrony, and PV+ firing inhibited nearby SPNs ~2ms later. PV+ interneurons thus provide both broad restraint and precise sculpting of striatal output to achieve fluid, appropriately timed behavior.",

      "title": "Synaptic Synchronization-Based Learning of Pattern Separation in Self-Organizing Probabilistic Spiking Neural Networks",
      "content": "Neuroscience-inspired neural networks bridge biology and technology, offering powerful tools to model brain function while enabling adaptive, efficient control in robotics. In this work, we present a neuroscience-inspired synaptic learning rule based on the synchronization of synaptic inputs to single excitatory neurons within a feedforward spiking neural network. The model consists of three excitatory layers and two feedback inhibitory layers, with initially low connection probabilities and weak synaptic weights assigned to the excitatory neurons. Under an unsupervised learning paradigm, stimulus patterns were presented to the network, allowing synaptic weights and connectivity to evolve dynamically across training trials. We investigated how these dynamics depended on feedback inhibition intensity and identified conditions under which the network achieved stable activity. Furthermore, we evaluated the model pattern separation efficacy and its relationship to network dynamics. The results highlight the critical role of feedback inhibition in both stabilizing the network and enhancing pattern separation. In particular, results show balanced synchronization between excitatory and inhibitory populations maximizes separation efficacy. Beyond providing a novel computational framework for understanding information processing in neural systems, this model also offers insights into cognitive disorders associated with impaired inhibition and pattern separation, such as autism and schizophrenia. Finally, we embedded the trained network within a simulated agent navigating a two-dimensional environment, where it was tasked with identifying a trained stimulus as an obstacle and avoiding it. The model offers a framework for advancing cognitive robotics by enabling novel approaches that mimic natural intelligence and support the learning of complex environmental patterns.",

      "title": "Competition between memories for reactivation as a mechanism for long-delay credit assignment",
      "content": "Animals can associate events with their outcomes, even if there is a long delay between the two. For example, in conditioned taste aversion, animals gain an aversion to a taste (the conditioned stimulus, CS) if sickness (an unconditioned stimulus, US) is induced up to 12 hours later. Established correlational plasticity mechanisms, operating on timescales of milliseconds to seconds, do not wholly explain how networks of neurons achieve such long-delay credit assignment. Moreover, if the animal experiences an intervening taste (an interfering stimulus, IS), the IS gains some \"credit\" for the causality of the outcome, reducing aversion to the CS. We hypothesize that reactivation of prior events at the time of outcome causes specific associative learning between those events and the outcome. We explore the inherent competition underlying credit assignment using a spiking neural network model storing memories through time-decaying synaptic strengthenings in two groups of neurons producing inherently competing attractor states. We show how the later memory can be reactivated more often and reduce the reactivation of a prior memory. Also, we provide a mechanism for the experimental finding of a rebound in association with, and therefore aversion to, the CS if the time between the following IS and US is increased. Such a result can appear paradoxical as associations typically diminish with time, but arises when the IS initially produces a strong decrease in reactivation of the CS, but reactivations of the CS thereafter increase, in spite of weakening synaptic strengths, because competing reactivations of the IS decrease more. By reactivating the memories probabilistically, neural circuits can assign the credit in a biologically plausible way.",

      "title": "Theta Activity Supports Landmark-Based Correction of Naturalistic Human Path Integration",
      "content": "<p>How do humans integrate landmarks to update their spatial position during active navigation? Using immersive virtual reality and high-density mobile EEG, we investigated the neural underpinnings of landmark-based recalibration during path integration in freely moving male and female humans. Participants navigated predefined routes, indicated the start position to quantify accumulated errors, and once per route corrected their estimate using a visual landmark. Our findings reveal that homing error accumulated along the course of navigation, but a briefly presented intramaze landmark effectively corrected accumulated errors. However, this effect was transient and less pronounced when participants were highly confident in their self-motion-based spatial representation suggesting that internal priors can hinder the assimilation of novel spatial cues. Theta activity in the retrosplenial complex supported the realignment of internal spatial representations by anchoring self-motion-derived estimates to visual landmark cues. Increased theta power and phase resetting upon landmark presentation accompanied subtle corrections, supporting a smooth realignment of spatial representations, whereas diminished synchronization marked the need for more extensive spatial updating. In addition, we identified motor-related theta response that scaled with rotational acceleration. Taken together, these findings highlight the dual role of theta oscillations in flexibly integrating multimodal signals, supporting both the recalibration of spatial representations to external cues and the encoding of self-motion information during naturalistic human navigation<i>.</i></p>",

      "title": "Cofilin Inhibition Ameliorates PIEZO2 and AMPA Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Angelman Syndrome",
      "content": "<p>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurogenetic disorder characterized by motor coordination and cognitive deficits. In AS, hippocampal neurons show reduced filamentous (F-)actin, a decrease we also reported in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, along with impaired mechanosensitive ion channel activity. Currently, there are no pharmacological targets to prevent the decrease of F-actin in AS. Here, we utilize a first-in-class selective cofilin inhibitor (SZ-3) to restore PIEZO2 function in DRG neurons and glutamate-evoked currents in hippocampal neurons from AS mice. Using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate that inhibiting cofilin, an actin-severing protein, with SZ-3 increases cellular stiffness by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, systemic administration of SZ-3 in male and female AS mice enhances their performance in the rotarod and T-maze tests. These findings support that cytoskeletal dysregulation contributes to impaired ion channel function and behavioral deficits and that actin-binding proteins could serve as a target for enhancing motor coordination and spatial learning in AS.</p>",

      "title": "Noninvasive Biomarkers for Assessing the Excitatory/Inhibitory Imbalance in Children with Epilepsy",
      "content": "<p>Epileptic seizures involve a cortical excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance driven by dysfunctional interneurons that contribute to gamma oscillation generation. While impaired gamma oscillations are commonly reported in epilepsy, the dynamics of broadband and narrowband gamma as well as beta oscillations remain underexplored. These oscillations may serve as noninvasive electrophysiological markers associated with altered cortical dynamics, potentially reflecting underlying excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Here, we recorded high-density electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography data to investigate visual stimuli-elicited cortical oscillations in 48 neurotypical (20 females) and 49 children (26 females) with epilepsy. We found that epilepsy is characterized by reduced amplitude and prolonged latency of evoked cortical response compared with controls after visual stimulation, with alterations in N1 peaks and M100, M150, and M250 components (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, source imaging revealed disrupted oscillatory features in epilepsy patients, including suppressed power, reduced amplitude, and increased latency in evoked and induced beta and gamma oscillations from the visual cortex (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). These alterations were consistent across diverse epilepsy subtypes, including focal, generalized, and nonlesional epilepsy cases. Utilizing these differences, we developed a novel classification model that differentiates individuals with epilepsy from controls with high accuracy, offering potential clinical utility in epilepsy diagnosis. Our results suggest disrupted beta and gamma oscillations may be associated with impaired inhibitory mechanisms and altered cortical dynamics, potentially indicative of an excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance. Our findings highlight the potential of noninvasive electrophysiological biomarkers to capture cortical dynamics possibly influenced by excitation&ndash;inhibition imbalance in epilepsy, supporting their use in early diagnosis and disease monitoring.</p>",

      "title": "Walking Modulates Active Auditory Sensing",
      "content": "<p>Walking provides the motor foundation for navigation, while navigation ensures that walking is purposeful and adaptive to environmental contexts. Sensory processing of environmental information acts as the informational bridge that connects walking and adaptive navigation. In the current study, we assessed if walking and the walking direction influences neuronal dynamics underlying environmental information processing. To this end, we conducted two experiments with 12 male and 18 female participants while they walked along an 8-shaped path. Auditory entrainment stimuli were continuously presented, and mobile electroencephalogram was recorded. We found increased auditory entrainment (auditory steady-state response) and early auditory evoked responses during walking compared with standing or stepping in place. We also replicated the well-established reduction of occipital alpha power during walking. The increase of auditory entrainment and the decrease of alpha power were correlated across participants. In the second experiment, randomly presented transient burst sounds led to a perturbation of the auditory entrainment response. The perturbation response was stronger during walking compared with standing; however, only when the burst sounds were presented to one ear but not to both ears. Most importantly, we found that the auditory entrainment was systematically modulated dependent on the walking path. The entrainment responses changed as a function of the turning direction. In general, the current work shows that walking changes auditory processing in a walking path-dependent way which might serve to optimize navigation. The walking path-related modulation might further reflect a shift of attention, marking a form of higher-order active sensing.</p>",

      "title": "TREK1 Channels Shape Spindle-Like Oscillations, Neuronal Activity, and Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity in Thalamocortical Circuits",
      "content": "<p>Although TREK1 channels are widely expressed in several thalamic nuclei, the role of this K<sub>2P</sub> family member in modulating thalamic cell excitability and physiological thalamocortical oscillatory activity is not well studied. Here we explored the contribution of TREK1 channels to membrane properties of two important building blocks of the thalamocortical (TC) system, namely, GABAergic neurons of reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN) and TC neurons in different sensory thalamic nuclei including the ventrobasal complex (VB; somatosensory system) and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN; auditory system), using male TREK1 knock-out (TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice. Furthermore, we show that the loss of TREK1 channels has distinct effects on neuronal function in different thalamic nuclei. Compared with controls, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit decreased excitability in RTN neurons, while VB neurons maintain similar excitability levels. Additionally, the absence of TREK1 channels alters the action potential (AP) characteristics in VB TC neurons and affects GABAergic inhibitory tone in RTN neurons. In TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, the excitability of cortical pyramidal cells is increased. It is tempting to assume that this combination of changes contributes to a high number of sharp, spindle-like oscillations observed in sleep local field potential (LFP) recordings of these mice. In addition, TREK1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice show a lower amount of delta (1&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz) oscillations during slow-wave sleep and a time-of-day-dependent alteration in the amount of sleep and wakefulness. They also show disturbed auditory signal processing and altered excitability in the auditory thalamus. These findings underline the relevance of TREK1 channels&rsquo; broad contribution to the thalamus and thalamocortical system.</p>",

      "title": "Common Mechanism Underlying Synaptic Dysfunction Caused by Preformed Fibril-Induced Accumulation of {alpha}-Synuclein or Tau in a Culture Propagation Model",
      "content": "<p>In sporadic neurodegenerative diseases, the endogenous proteins &alpha;-synuclein in Parkinson's disease and tau in Alzheimer's disease undergo pathogenic prion-like propagation over many years, accumulating in both soluble and insoluble forms in neurons including synapses, where they impair synaptic transmission and potentially cause various neuronal symptoms. To investigate the functional outcome of such synaptic accumulation, we induced accumulation of endogenous proteins in murine and human synapses by incubating mouse (of either sex) neuronal cultures with pathogenic preformed fibrils (pffs). Two weeks after treatment with human &alpha;-synuclein or tau pff, the respective endogenous proteins accumulated in neurons including presynaptic terminals, where we also observed tubulin accumulation, suggesting microtubule over-assembly. These were not associated with mRNA upregulation and were prevented by pharmacological stimulation of autophagy. Both pffs caused accumulation of p62 in cell bodies, suggesting compromised protein degradation. pHluorin imaging in synapses indicated a marked prolongation of vesicular endocytic time, which was rescued by pharmacological depolymerization of microtubules or by the overexpression of full-length dynamin 1. Since dynamin is a high-affinity binding partner of microtubules as well as an endocytic key molecule, over-assembled microtubules can sequester dynamin, thereby inhibiting endocytosis. We conclude that pff-induced accumulation of &alpha;-synuclein or tau in presynaptic terminals can disrupt vesicle endocytosis through a common mechanism. Since endocytosis-dependent vesicle recycling is critical for maintaining neurotransmitter release, its disruption can affect the neurocircuitry operations involved, thereby causing diverse symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, our data suggest a common molecular mechanism underlying synaptic dysfunctions associated with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that readily establishes reward memories contributing to METH relapse. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is central to cognition, motivation, reward, and emotion, and the hippocampus is critically involved in reward memory. The mPFC possesses an enormous variety of projection neurons. However, the direct projection from the mPFC to the hippocampus involved in METH addiction has not been studied well. To explore the role of a mPFC-hippocampus pathway of regulating METH reward memory, conditioned place preference (CPP) was used to detect reward memory and recombinant adeno-associated virus 2/9s (rAAV2/9s) were used to label neurons, identify projections, and optogenetically explore involvement of the male mice mPFC-hippocampus pathway in regulating METH-CPP. We found that a novel prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL) projection directly to the dorsal hippocampus CA1 (dCA1) regulated CPP induced by METH. Moreover, optogenetic activation or inhibition and silencing the PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway with tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) modulated METH-CPP. Our results reveal a PrL to dCA1 glutamatergic pathway that regulates METH-CPP and could serve as a potential target for treating METH use disorder.</p>",
