      "title": "Behavioral evidence for visually dominant audiovisual motion integration",
      "content": "Accurate motion perception is crucial for navigating complex environments, where sensory information is often derived from multiple modalities. While multisensory cues improve performance in tasks involving stationary stimuli, the integration of dynamic motion cues is less understood. Here, we examined the nature of auditory and visual motion integration and determined whether attentional instructions modulate integration. Sixty participants performed direction discrimination tasks under auditory, visual, and audiovisual conditions, with cueing instructions to attend to one or both modalities. Results showed that visual motion direction estimates were more reliable than auditory ones, and audiovisual estimates were superior to either modality alone. Additionally, visual motion estimates were more stable that auditory motion estimates during direction conflict trials. Reliability-weighted models of integration closely predicted audiovisual performance, demonstrating optimal integration. Sensory dominance (visual vs. auditory) influenced sensitivity to audiovisual motion, with visual dominant participants performing better overall. Our results demonstrate that the perception of audiovisual motion is dominated by vision and is shaped by top-down attention.",

      "title": "Developmental regulation of long-range neuroblast migration by Eph/ephrin signaling",
      "content": "In the developing mouse anterior forebrain, the rostral migratory stream (RMS) supports continued proliferation and efficient transportation of large quantities of neuroblasts from the ventricular-subventricular (V-SVZ) stem cell niche to the olfactory bulb (OB). Astrocytes aid this migration by providing a glial network through which chains of fasciculated neuroblasts move. The largest receptor tyrosine kinase family, Eph receptors, and their ephrin ligands have been implicated in controlling neuroblast migration and astrocyte organization within this pathway. However, a clear understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying Eph/ephrin signaling remains elusive due, in part, to the complexity of heterogeneous expression patterns in both neuroblasts and astrocytes, as well as the cytoarchitectural changes that occur during postnatal development. To address this gap, we analyzed RMS cytoarchitecture together with transcriptomic and proteomic profiles at postnatal days P6, P12, and P60, and mapped Eph-ephrin interactions using predictive interaction models. Our data revealed temporally regulated, cell type-specific, receptor-ligand interactions, highlighting the prevalence and dynamic shifts of neuroblast-neuroblast, neuroblast-astrocyte, astrocyte-astrocyte interactions. Together, these findings established a framework that deconvoluted and characterized Eph and ephrin signaling as the RMS changed from a diffuse stream of migratory neuroblasts to a highly constricted pathway of neuroblast chains within astrocytic networks.",

      "content": "IntroductionApproximate numerical comparison is often influenced by various non-numerical sensory cues, yet whether they act via uniform inhibition (inhibitory control theory) or cue-weighted integration (sensory integration theory) remains debated.MethodsTo clarify this theoretical controversy, the present study tested a cue-specific, temporally staged account by orthogonally manipulating numerosity with a holistic, highweight cue (convex hull) and a basic, lower-weight cue (average dot size) while recording fronto-central ERPs (P2, N450). Twenty-five adults performed a rapid dot array comparison under four congruency conditions.ResultsBehavior showed clear convex-hull dominance: accuracy was high whenever convex hull aligned with numerosity and dropped when it conflicted, regardless of dot-size consistency; response times were unchanged. ERPs revealed a two-stage dynamic: the early P2 selectively tracked dot-size congruency (larger for dot-size\u2013congruent trials), consistent with automatic integration of basic features, whereas the later N450 scaled with conflict structure and cue weight (fully congruent < dot-size\u2013congruent < fully incongruent < convex-hull\u2013congruent/dot-size\u2013incongruent), with no latency differences.DiscussionThese converging results support a time-resolved, weightsensitive mechanism in which basic features bias integration early and holistic configurations dominate later choice and recruit control when misaligned. The account reconciles sensory-integration and inhibitory-control views and motivates further tests of how cue\u2013cue and cue\u2013number conflicts shape numerical decisions.",

      "content": "Single-channel EEG-based sleep staging methods are well-suited for wearable applications in home environments, offering a practical solution to reduce the diagnostic burden on clinical institutions and address the growing demand for large-scale sleep monitoring. However, its reliability remains a critical concern compared to multi-channel polysomnography (PSG) used in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a Transformer-based sleep staging model and conduct a systematic investigation into the causal-inspired analysis between EEG channel selection and staging reliability. Our experiments reveal that electrodes positioned over the central brain region yield significantly higher accuracy, macro-F1, and consistency in sleep stage classification compared to those located in frontal or occipital regions. These findings provide causal insights into the spatial determinants of perceptual reliability in EEG-based sleep monitoring, supporting the design of robust wearable systems.",

      "content": "IntroductionThe functional connectivity topology of the primary visual cortex (V1) shapes sensory processing and cross-modal integration, yet how different sensory modalities reorganize V1 network architecture remains unclear. We hypothesized that multimodal input drives a shift from hub-centric, modular processing toward globally integrated, distributed configurations.MethodsWe performed in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in awake mice to record population activity in V1 during unimodal visual (V) and bimodal visuotactile (V+T) stimulation. From fluorescence time series, we constructed functional connectivity networks and quantified graph-theoretical metrics, including betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, degree centrality, global efficiency, and modularity. Networks were computed per animal and compared across conditions using appropriate non-parametric statistics.ResultsUnimodal visual stimulation increased betweenness centrality and highlighted prominent hub nodes, supporting locally modular, hub-centric information control. In contrast, bimodal visuotactile stimulation elevated closeness centrality and global efficiency, broadened connectivity, and reduced modularity, indicating enhanced global integration with more distributed information flow. Moreover, under unimodal conditions the top five centrality nodes exhibited significantly stronger calcium responses than other neurons, whereas this response hierarchy was abolished under bimodal stimulation.DiscussionV1 dynamically balances local specialization and global integration through context-dependent topological reconfiguration: unimodal processing relies on hub-centric, modular architectures, while cross-modal input promotes globally optimized, distributed networks with higher connectivity efficiency. These findings provide a network-level framework for multisensory integration and offer insights relevant to theories of sensory computation and potential strategies to harness cross-modal plasticity.",

      "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",

      "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
      "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",
