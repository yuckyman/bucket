      "title": "Progressive bilateral recruitment and resilient network reorganization during temporal lobe epilepsy",
      "content": "Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often originates from focal hippocampal injury but progressively evolves into a bilateral epileptic network engaging both hippocampi and distributed cortical regions. A mechanistic understanding of how this network emerges, and whether early perturbation of specific nodes can alter its trajectory, is essential for developing network-level therapeutic strategies. Objective: We used a kainate-induced rodent model of TLE to (1) characterize the spatiotemporal emergence of epileptic discharges during the latent phase, (2) determine how bilaterally synchronized events develop, and (3) test whether transient chemogenetic silencing of either the ipsilateral epileptogenic focus (EF) or the contralateral hippocampus (CH) modifies large-scale epileptogenesis. Methods: Freely moving mice were implanted with multisite electrodes spanning bilateral hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA1, subiculum) and cortical regions (M2, Cg1, PrL, V1, entorhinal cortex). Longitudinal LFP recordings were performed every other day during the latent and early chronic phases following KA or saline injection. DREADD-based chemogenetic inhibition of glutamatergic neurons was applied between days 2-7 post-KA. Epileptiform events were quantified via spike rates, waveform metrics, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and short-latency interregional co-spiking. Results: Early after KA, epileptic spiking emerged locally in the ipsilateral dentate gyrus and progressively organized into HFO-coupled discharges. Contralateral hippocampal recruitment followed a distinctive biphasic time course, characterized by transient early activation, subsequent suppression, and later re-emergence with increasing bilateral coactivation. Cortical regions gradually developed higher spike rates and enhanced DG-related co-spiking, indicating large-scale network integration. Ipsilateral silencing modified local spike composition but did not prevent global network progression, whereas contralateral silencing accelerated ipsilateral epileptogenesis and strengthened pathological HFO expression. Conclusion: Epileptogenesis in the KA model reflects a transition from a focal hippocampal insult to a resilient, bilateral cortico-hippocampal network. Targeting a single hippocampal node, even at early latent stage, is insufficient to halt this progression, highlighting the need for network-level therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "Cellular mechanisms underlying social regulation of the posterior tubercular nucleus in zebrafish (Danio rerio)",
      "content": "Social status profoundly influences animal behavior through neural plasticity, yet the cellular mechanisms that mediate reconfiguration of neuromodulatory systems remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated status-dependent structural changes in the posterior tubercular nucleus (PTN) of adult zebrafish. Animals were assigned to four social conditions: communal, isolated, dominant, or subordinate. Using markers for cell proliferation (PCNA) and birth-dating (BrdU), we demonstrate that social dominance significantly enhances neurogenesis, leading to an increased population of PTN dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, subordinate and isolated fish exhibited suppressed neurogenesis and elevated expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), suggesting that chronic social stress induces an oxidative burden that may lead to neuronal loss. Furthermore, we identified evidence of neurotransmitter phenotypic plasticity; subordinate fish displayed a significantly higher ratio of glutamatergic (vglut2a) to dopaminergic (dat) expression in PTN neurons compared to dominants, suggesting a status-dependent shift in neuromodulatory identity. Multivariate principal component analysis further revealed distinct neurobiological profiles that separate social ranks, suggesting that status-dependent plasticity is a coordinated multi-modal response. Collectively, our results improve our understanding of how social experience reshapes the zebrafish brain through integrated changes in cell proliferation, cellular shift in cellular identity and regulation of cellular viability; thus, providing a potential mechanism for the maintenance of stable behavioral phenotypes in competitive social environments.",

      "title": "Optimizing Network-Level TMS-fMRI: Benchmarking a Novel TMS-Compatible \"Sushi\" MR Coil",
      "content": "Introduction: Concurrent TMS-fMRI allows to observe how stimulation affects the target region and connected brain-wide networks. However, hardware limitations represent a major constraint: standard MR head coils provide high imaging sensitivity but no room for the TMS coil, whereas available TMS-compatible MR head coils offer access but low or strongly inhomogeneous signal. Methods: We developed and benchmarked a flexible \"Sushi\" MR-receive setup, assembled from two repurposed 18-channel body arrays, that allows TMS coil positioning while maintaining full-brain coverage. Resting-state (n = 12) and task-based working memory (n = 8) fMRI were acquired with the Sushi coil, a commercially available 2x7-channel Surface-coil setup, and a standard Siemens 64-channel (non-TMS-capable) head coil. The image-quality cost of TMS capability was addressed by acquiring multi-echo fMRI to allow post-hoc optimization of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but no TMS was delivered. Results: From resting-state fMRI, the Sushi mapped known canonical resting-state networks (RSNs) comparably to the 64-channel reference and was superior to the Surface coils, in particular for the default-mode, auditory, and visual networks. Task-fMRI data showed that Sushi recovered the working memory network more similarly to the 64-channel reference than the Surface coil. Temporal SNR was optimized for all coil acquisitions yielding ~30-50% gain and improving between-coil comparability for RSNs identification and task-related activity. Conclusions: Together, post-hoc multi-echo optimization and the Sushi coil setup provide a low-cost, ready-to-use solution for whole-brain concurrent TMS-fMRI recordings. Combining stimulation access with reliable functional network readouts is essential to probe mechanisms of TMS and to inform effective TMS interventions targeting altered brain systems.",

      "title": "Innovative approach of nonlinear controllers design for prosthetic knee performance",
      "content": "Prosthetic knee joints are essential assistive technologies designed to replicate natural gait and improve mobility for individuals with lower-limb loss. This study presents a comprehensive nonlinear dynamic model of a two-degree-of-freedom prosthetic knee joint and introduces three robust nonlinear control strategies: Integral Sliding Mode Control, Conditional Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control, and Conditional Adaptive Positive Semidefinite Barrier Function-based Sliding Mode Control. These controllers are designed to address the challenges associated with nonlinear joint dynamics, external disturbances, and modeling uncertainties during locomotion. To optimize control performance, the gain parameters of each controller were fine-tuned using Red Fox Optimization, a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the intelligent hunting behavior of red foxes. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov theory, and control effectiveness is evaluated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and validated via hardware-in-the-loop testing using a C2000 Delfino F28379D microcontroller. Among the three controllers, the CoBA-based approach demonstrated the highest tracking accuracy, fastest convergence, and smoothest torque profile. The close agreement between simulation and experimental results confirms the practical applicability of the proposed control framework, offering a promising solution for intelligent and adaptive prosthetic knee systems.",

It uses libcst for AST transforms on common patterns (so no LLM needed for the straightforward stuff like .dict() \u2192 .model_dump()), and falls back to an LLM for trickier migrations. Right now it has a knowledge base of 15 popular packages including Pydantic, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Requests.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong> Anyone who's put off upgrading a dependency because they didn't want to manually fix hundreds of breaking changes. I built this for my own projects but it should be useful for anyone dealing with major version migrations.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most tools just bump your version numbers (like pip-tools, poetry update) or tell you what's outdated. Codeshift actually modifies your source code to match the new API. The closest thing is</p> <p>probably Facebook's codemod/libcst, but that requires you to write your own transforms - this comes with them built in.</p> <p>Looking for feedback on the tool and what you would like to see added to it!</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Ragab-Technologies/Codeshift\">https://github.com/Ragab-Technologies/Codeshift</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bolation123\"> /u/bolation123 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqesv3/built_a_tool_that_rewrites_your_code_when/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqesv3/built_a_tool_that_rewrites_your_code_when/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Retries and circuit breakers as failure policies in Python",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Retries and circuit breakers are often treated as separate concerns with one library for retries (if not just spinning your own retry loops) and another for breakers. Each one with its own knobs and semantics.</p> <p>I've found that before deciding <em>how</em> to respond (retry, fail fast, trip a breaker), it's best to decide <em>what kind of failure occurred</em>. </p> <p>I've been working on a small Python library called <a href=\"https://github.com/aponysus/redress\">redress</a> that implements this idea by treating retries and circuit breakers as <strong>policy responses to classified failure</strong>, not separate mechanisms. </p> <p>Failures are mapped to a small set of semantic error classes (RATE_LIMIT, SERVER_ERROR, TRANSIENT, etc.). Policies then decide how to respond to each class in a bounded, observable way. </p> <p>Here's an example using a unified policy that includes both retry and circuit breaking (neither of which are necessary if the user just wants sensible defaults):</p> <pre><code>from redress import Policy, Retry, CircuitBreaker, ErrorClass, default_classifier from redress.strategies import decorrelated_jitter policy = Policy( retry=Retry( classifier=default_classifier, strategy=decorrelated_jitter(max_s=5.0), deadline_s=60.0, max_attempts=6, ), # Fail fast when the upstream is persistently unhealthy circuit_breaker=CircuitBreaker( failure_threshold=5, window_s=60.0, recovery_timeout_s=30.0, trip_on={ErrorClass.SERVER_ERROR, ErrorClass.CONCURRENCY}, ), ) result = policy.call(lambda: do_work(), operation=&quot;sync_op&quot;) </code></pre> <p>Retries and circuit breakers share the same classification, lifecycle, and observability hooks. When a policy stops retrying or trips a breaker, it does so far an explicit reason that can be surfaced directly to metrics and/or logs. </p> <p>The goal is to make failure handling explicit, bounded, and diagnosable.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>This project is intended for production use in Python services where retry behavior needs to be controlled carefully under real failure conditions.</p> <p>It\u2019s most relevant for:</p> <ul> <li>backend or platform engineers</li> <li>services calling unreliable upstreams (HTTP APIs, databases, queues)</li> <li>teams that want retries and circuit breaking to be bounded and observable</li> <li>It\u2019s likely overkill if you just need a simple decorator with a fixed backoff.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Most Python retry libraries focus on how to retry (decorators, backoff math), and treat all failures similarly or apply one global strategy.</p> <p>redress is different. It classifies failures first, before deciding how to respond, allows per-error-class retry strategies, treatsretries and circuit breakers as part of the same policy model, and emits structured lifecycle events so retry and breaker decisions are observable. </p> <p><strong>Links</strong></p> <p>Project: <a href=\"https://github.com/aponysus/redress\">https://github.com/aponysus/redress</a></p> <p>Docs: <a href=\"https://aponysus.github.io/redress/\">https://aponysus.github.io/redress/</a></p> <p>I'm very interested in feedback if you've built or operated such systems in Python. If you've solved it differently or think this model has sharp edges, please let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/qiaoshiya\"> /u/qiaoshiya </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqh7yb/retries_and_circuit_breakers_as_failure_policies/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqh7yb/retries_and_circuit_breakers_as_failure_policies/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For the past 10 years I\u2019ve been a volunteer organizer of <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2026/attend/startup-row/\">Startup Row</a> at PyCon US, and I wanted to let all the entrepreneurs and early-stage startup employees know that applications for free booth space at PyCon US close at the end of this weekend. (The webpage says this Friday, but I can assure you that the web form will stay up through the weekend.)</p> <p>There\u2019s a lot of information on the Startup Row page on the PyCon US website, and a post on the <a href=\"https://pycon.blogspot.com/2026/01/apply-for-pycon-startup-row-2026.html\">PyCon blog</a> if you\u2019re interested. But I figured I\u2019d summarize it all in the form of an FAQ.</p> <p><strong>What is Startup Row at PyCon US?</strong></p> <p>Since 2011 the Python Software Foundation and conference organizers have reserved booth space for early-stage startups at PyCon US. It is, in short, a row of booths for startups building cool things with Python. Companies can apply for booth space on Startup Row and recipients are selected through a competitive review process. The selection committee consists mostly of startup founders that have previously presented on Startup Row.</p> <p><strong>How to I apply?</strong></p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2026/applications/apply/startup-row/\">Submit your application here!</a>\u201d button at the bottom of the Startup Row page will take you to the application form.</p> <p>There are a half-dozen questions that you\u2019ve probably already answered if you\u2019ve applied to any sort of incubator, accelerator, or startup competition.</p> <p>You will need to create a PyCon US login first, but that takes only a minute.</p> <p><strong>Deadline?</strong></p> <p>Technically the webpage says applications close on Friday January 30th. The web form will remain active through this weekend.</p> <p>Our goal is to give companies a final decision on their application status by mid-February, which is plenty of time to book your travel and sort out logistics.</p> <p><strong>What does my company get if selected to be on Startup Row?</strong></p> <p>At no cost to them, Startup Row companies receive:</p> <ul> <li>Two included conference passes, with additional passes available for your team at a discount.</li> <li>Booth space in the Expo Hall on Startup Row for the Opening Reception on the evening of Thursday May 14th and for both days of the main conference, Friday May 15th and Saturday May 16th.</li> <li>Optionally: A table at the PyCon US Job Fair on Sunday May 17th. (If you\u2019re company is hiring Python talent, there is likely nowhere better than PyCon US for technical recruiting.)</li> <li>Placement on the PyCon US 2026 website and a profile on the PyCon US blog (where you\u2019re reading this post)</li> <li>Eternal glory</li> </ul> <p>Basically, getting a spot on Startup Row gives your company the same experience as a paying sponsor of PyCon at no cost. Teams are still responsible for flights, hotels, and whatever materials you bring for your booth.</p> <p><strong>What are the eligibility requirements?</strong></p> <p>Pretty simple:</p> <ul> <li>You have to use Python somewhere in your stack, the more the better.</li> <li>Company is less than 2.5 years old (either from founding or from public launch)</li> <li>Has 25 or fewer employees</li> <li>Has not already presented on Startup Row or sponsored PyCon US. (Founders who previously applied but weren\u2019t selected are welcome to apply again. Alumni founders working on new companies are also welcome to apply.)</li> </ul> <p>Apart from the &quot;use Python somewhere&quot; rule, all the other criteria are somewhat fuzzy. </p> <p><strong>If you have questions, please shoot me a DM or chat request.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jrowley\"> /u/jrowley </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqjbep/pycon_us_grants_free_booth_space_and_conference/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qqjbep/pycon_us_grants_free_booth_space_and_conference/\">[comments]</a></span>",
