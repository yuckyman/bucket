      "content": "ObjectiveBased on the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), signal mining of adverse drug events (AEs) caused by Botulinum Toxin Type A (BoNTA) was performed to explore its safety implications for the treatment of cerebral palsy (CP).MethodsThe OpenVigil 2.1 platform was used to extract AE reports on BoNTA from the FAERS database, covering the period from the fourth quarter of 2003 to the second quarter of 2024. Safety data were analyzed using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), with BoNTA designated as the primary suspect drug.ResultsA total of 124,538 AE reports related to BoNTA were identified, showing an overall upward trend in the annual report counts. Most reports originated from the United States, with patients predominantly aged 36\u201360\u202fyears and predominantly female. Prolonged hospitalization was the most frequently reported serious adverse event. Signal analysis identified 325 disproportionately reported events across 21 system-organ classes (SOCs). The top five preferred terms (PTs) by frequency were eyelid ptosis, dysphagia, muscle weakness, blurred vision, and injection site swelling. The top five PTs based on signal strength were brow ptosis, Mephisto sign, botulism, bizarre personal appearance, and neuromuscular toxicity. Notable lowest-level terms (LLTs) included eye swelling, injection site edema, facial pain, facial discomfort, increased residual urine volume, blurred vision, and eyelid swelling.ConclusionIn clinical practice involving BoNTA for CP treatment, clinicians should pay close attention to these identified signals. Strengthened pre-injection evaluation and post-injection monitoring are recommended to enable early detection and timely intervention, ensuring medication safety for patients.",

The final dataset included 598 samples, with an SCD incidence rate of 26.12%. The data were randomly divided into a training set (n = 418). A validation set (n = 180) at a ratio of 7:3. In the training set, prediction models for SCD were constructed using logistic regression (LR), Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and neural network algorithms. Model performance on the validation set was assessed by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score. SHAP values were used for model interpretability analysis.ResultsThe SVM model showed good performance in the training set, with an AUC of 0.82, indicating strong predictive ability. Information Overload (IO), Self-Perception (SP), Energy Level (EL), Depressive Emotion (DE), Gender (SEX), Risk Decision (RD), and Short-Term Memory (STM) were important feature variables for SCD occurrence.ConclusionThis study successfully developed an SVM-based model for screening the risk of SCD. The SVM model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Neural Network, and traditional LR models.",

      "title": "Finite element analysis of a neural implant for cytostatic hypothermia and a novel heat management system",
      "content": "The treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) presents significant challenges, with median survival rates remaining low despite standard-of-care therapies. A novel approach, cytostatic hypothermia (CH), is under development against GBM; it is a window of temperature (typically 20 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C) which halts tumor growth in vivo. Objective. This feasibility study expands upon the findings through the computational evaluation of a fully implantable system. Our simulations evaluate a thermoelectric cooler with a microwire array (NeuraTEC) and a novel ambient recirculating core (ARC) to achieve uniform cooling of a region in the brain without overheating local skin temperature. Approach. Finite-element modeling was employed to simulate coupled bioheat transfer and laminar non-isothermal fluid flow dynamics. Main results. Our results indicate that NeuraTEC can attain local tissue temperatures within a cytostatic range while minimizing thermal gradients. The use of multiple narrow, thermally conductive wires enhances cooling uniformity with minimal tissue displacement. The ARC provides a unique form of heat management that enables full implantability and hence portability. This work suggests it can facilitate the transfer of heat from a brain region to the skin. Future work will focus on device prototyping and validation through in vitro and in vivo studies in large animal models. Significance. These simulations suggest that the proposed intracranial cooling system could make CH a practicable approach against GBM. Furthermore, this approach to internal heat management may also open new avenues for treating neurological conditions through local and chronic hypothermia, extending beyond the short-duration (acute) cooling methods currently tested.",

      "title": "Source tracing with spatial phase gradients in epileptiform activity localizes seizure onset zone",
      "content": "Objective. Sources of epileptic traveling waves offer critical insights into seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization, making them invaluable for preoperative assessment in patients with epilepsy. However, the absence of tailored source-tracing methods and the inherent instability of epileptiform activity make it difficult to achieve reliable source identification for SOZ localization. This study aimed to analyze the propagation pattern during seizure events and develop a framework to trace the sources of epileptic expanding traveling waves (ETWs). Approach. 101 seizure events were recorded from five 4-Aminopyridine-induced acute cortical rat epilepsy models. In each seizure event, epileptiform activities were classified into two categories according to their time-frequency diagrams (multiband and non-multiband epileptiform activities). The center of the SOZ was regarded as the recording site with the largest amplitude of epileptiform activities. Using the spatial-phase-based analysis, we analyzed the propagation pattern during the seizure event and extracted the ETWs. The sources of ETWs were traced by the intersection of spatial-phase-gradient. Main results. The ETW proportion of multiband epileptiform activities was 62.7% 8.3%, significantly higher than those in non-multiband epileptiform activities (53.8% 9.0%). ETWs with stable propagation patterns gave rise to a concentrated source tracing outcome. The single-band signal (component of the multiband activities) had a more stable ETW propagation pattern than both the multiband and non-multiband activities. The source tracing results of the single-band signals clustered around the SOZ center and remained stable even when the SOZ center was out of coverage (removing half of the recording sites, among which the SOZ center was included). Significance. The proposed framework enables ETW extraction from epileptiform activities and can trace ETW sources even when the sources are out of coverage. Therefore, the proposed framework may prove clinically valuable in cases with sparse intracranial recordings, addressing the limitation of traditional SOZ localization methods.",

      "title": "Foundation models for EEG decoding: current progress and prospective research",
      "content": "Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) records the spontaneous electrical activity in the brain. Despite the growing application of deep learning in EEG decoding, traditional methods still rely heavily on supervised learning, which is often limited by task specificity and dataset dependency, restricting model performance and generalization. Inspired by the success of large language models, EEG foundation models (EEG FMs) are attracting increasing attention as a unified paradigm for EEG decoding. In this study, we review a selection of representative studies on EEG FMs, aiming to extract trends and provide recommendations for future research. Approach. We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent advances in EEG FMs, with a focus on downstream tasks, benchmark datasets, model architectures, and pre-training techniques. We analyze and synthesize core FMs components, and systematically compare their performances and generalizabilities. Main results. Our review reveals that EEG FMs are pre-trained on large-scale datasets, typically involving several hundred subjects. The number of subjects can reach up to 14\u2009987, with a maximum total duration of 27\u2009062\u2009h. Current EEG FMs most adopt mask-based reconstruction pre-training strategy and employ efficient transformer-based architectures. Our comparative analysis shows that EEG FMs demonstrate significant potential in advancing EEG decoding tasks, particularly in seizure detection. However, their performance in complex scenarios such as motor imagery decoding remains limited. Significance. This review summarizes the existing approaches and performance outcomes of EEG FM, offers valuable insights into their current limitations and delineates prospective avenues for future research.",

      "title": "Dreaming about pain: Dreams series of a chronic pain patient.",
      "content": "The occurrence of physical pain in the dreams of healthy individuals is relatively rare, while patient populations report pain more frequently in their dreams. This study conducted dream content analysis on a long dream series (N = 4,254) from a patient diagnosed with a chronic pain-inducing illness at a young age. We found that 9.76% of the dream reports referenced pain, experienced by the dreamer, other characters, or as a thematic element. The dreamer frequently reported pain in her whole body, limbs, and joints, suggesting a correspondence with her waking-life experiences with pain. The emotional tone of the pain dreams was predominantly negative, though occasional positive emotions reflecting relief from pain were observed. These findings highlight the multifaceted ways of integrating pain into dream content and suggest continuity between waking-life pain and pain dreams. Future research should explore the exact relationship between waking-life pain intensity and pain dream frequency in chronic pain patients to better understand pain as a sensory characteristic of dreaming.

      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><ul> <li><strong>What My Project Does</strong></li> </ul> <p>The Zero-ology team recently tackled a high-precision computational challenge at the intersection of HPC, algorithmic engineering, and complex algebraic geometry. We developed the <strong>Grand Constant Aggregator (GCA)</strong> framework -- a fully reproducible computational tool designed to generate <strong>numerical evidence</strong> for the <strong>Hodge Conjecture</strong> on <strong>K3 surfaces</strong> ran in a Python script.</p> <p>The core challenge is establishing formal certificates of numerical linear independence at an unprecedented scale. GCA systematically compares known transcendental periods against a canonically generated set of \u03c1 real numbers, called the <strong>Grand Constants</strong>, for K3 surfaces of Picard rank \u03c1 \u2208 {1,10,16,18,20}.</p> <p>The GCA Framework's core thesis is a computationally driven attempt to provide overwhelming numerical support for the Hodge Conjecture, specifically for five chosen families of K3 surfaces (Picard ranks 1, 10, 16, 18, 20).</p> <p>The primary mechanism is a test for linear independence using the PSLQ algorithm.</p> <p>The Target Relation: The standard Hodge Conjecture requires showing that the transcendental period $(\\omega)$ of a cycle is linearly dependent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers) on the periods of the <em>actual</em> algebraic cycles ($\\alpha_j$).</p> <p>The GCA Substitution: The framework substitutes the unknown periods of the algebraic cycles ($\\alpha_j$) with a set of synthetically generated, highly-reproducible, transcendental numbers, called the <strong>Grand Constants</strong> ($\\mathcal{C}_j$), produced by the <strong>Grand Constant Aggregator (GCA)</strong> formula.</p> <p>The Test: The framework tests for an integer linear dependence relation among the set $(\\omega, \\mathcal{C}_1, \\mathcal{C}_2, \\dots, \\mathcal{C}_\\rho)$.</p> <p>The observed failure of PSLQ to find a relation suggests that the period $\\omega$ is numerically independent of the GCA constants $\\mathcal{C}_j$.</p> <p>-Generating these certificates required deterministic reproducibility across arbitrary hardware.</p> <p>-Every test had to be machine-verifiable while maintaining extremely high precision.</p> <p>For Algorithmic and Precision Details we rely on the PSLQ algorithm (via Python's mpmath) to search for integer relations between complex numbers. Calculations were pushed to 4000-digit precision with an error tolerance of 10^-3900.</p> <p>This extreme precision tests the limits of standard arbitrary-precision libraries, requiring careful memory management and reproducible hash-based constants.</p> <h1><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zer00logy/blob/main/hodge_GCA.py\">hodge_GCA.py</a> Results</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Surface Family</th> <th align=\"left\">Picard Rank \u03c1</th> <th align=\"left\">Transcendental Period \u03c9</th> <th align=\"left\">PSLQ Outcome (4000 digits)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"></td> <td align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Fermat quartic</td> <td align=\"left\">20</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Kummer (CM by \u221a\u22127)</td> <td align=\"left\">18</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Generic Kummer</td> <td align=\"left\">16</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Double sextic</td> <td align=\"left\">10</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Quartic with one line</td> <td align=\"left\">1</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/3)\u2076 / (4\u03c0\u00b3)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Every test confirmed no integer relations detected, demonstrating the consistency and reproducibility of the GCA framework. While GCA produces strong heuristic evidence, bridging the remaining gap to a formal Clay-level proof requires:</p> <p>--Computing exact algebraic cycle periods.<br /> ---Verifying the Picard lattice symbolically.<br /> ----Scaling symbolic computations to handle full transcendental precision.</p> <p><strong>The GCA is the Numerical Evidence:</strong> The GCA framework provides &quot;the strongest uniform computational evidence&quot; by using the PSLQ algorithm to numerically confirm that no integer relation exists up to 4,000 digits. It explicitly states: &quot;We emphasize that this framework is heuristic: it does not constitute a formal proof acceptable to the Clay Mathematics Institute.&quot;</p> <p>The use of the PSLQ algorithm at an unprecedented 4000-digit precision (and a tolerance of $10^{-3900}$) for these transcendental relations is a remarkable computational feat. The higher the precision, the stronger the conviction that a small-integer relation truly does not exist.</p> <p><strong>Proof vs. Heuristic:</strong> proving that $\\omega$ is independent of the <em>GCA constants</em> is mathematically irrelevant to the Hodge Conjecture unless one can prove a link between the GCA constants and the true periods. This makes the result a compelling piece of heuristic evidence <strong>--</strong> it increases confidence in the conjecture by failing to find a relation with a highly independent set of constants -- but it <strong>does not constitute a formal proof</strong> that would be accepted by the Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI), it could possibly be completed with a Team with the correct instruments and equipment.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Algebra</strong><br /> The Algebraic Structure, It defines the universal, infinite, self-generating algebra of all possible mathematical constants ($\\mathcal{G}_n$). It is the axiomatic foundation.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Aggregator</strong><br /> The Specific Computational Tool or Methodology. It is the reproducible $\\text{hash-based algorithm}$ used to generate a <em>specific subset</em> of $\\mathcal{G}_n$ constants ($\\mathcal{C}_j$) needed for a particular application, such as the numerical testing of the Hodge Conjecture.</p> <p>The <strong>Aggregator</strong> dictates the structure of the <strong>vector</strong> that must admit a non-trivial integer relation. The goal is to find a vector of integers $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_\\rho)$ such that:</p> <p>$$\\sum_{i=0}^{\\rho} a_i \\cdot \\text{Period}_i = 0$$</p> <ul> <li><strong>Comparison</strong></li> </ul> <p>Most computational work related to the Hodge Conjecture focuses on either:</p> <p>Symbolic methods (Magma, SageMath, PARI/GP): These typically compute exact algebraic cycle lattices, Picard ranks, and polynomial invariants using fully symbolic algebra. They do not attempt large-scale transcendental PSLQ tests at thousands of digits.</p> <p>Period computation frameworks (numerical integration of differential forms): These compute transcendental periods for specific varieties but rarely push integer-relation detection beyond a few hundred digits, and almost never attempt uniform tests across multiple K3 families.</p> <p>Low-precision PSLQ / heuristic checks: PSLQ is widely used to detect integer relations among constants, but almost all published work uses 100\u2013300 digits, far below true heuristic-evidence territory.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Aggregator</strong> is fundamentally different:</p> <p>Uniformity: Instead of computing periods case-by-case, GCA introduces the <em>Grand Constants</em>, a reproducible, hash-generated constant basis that works identically for any K3 surface with Picard rank \u03c1.</p> <p>Scale: GCA pushes PSLQ to 4000 digits with a staggering 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079\u2070\u2070 tolerance, far above typical computational methods in algebraic geometry.</p> <p>Hardware-independent reproducibility: 4000 digit numeric proof ran in python on a laptop.</p> <p>Cross-family verification: Instead of testing one K3 surface in isolation, GCA performs a five-family sweep across Picard ranks {1, 10, 16, 18, 20}, each requiring different transcendental structures.</p> <p><strong>Open-source</strong> commercial license: Very few computational frameworks for transcendental geometry are fully open and commercially usable. GCA encourages verification and extension by outside HPC teams, startups, and academic researchers.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Target Audience</strong> </li> </ul> <p>This next stage is an HPC-level challenge, likely requiring supercomputing resources and specialized systems like Magma or SageMath, combined with high-precision arithmetic.</p> <p>To support this community, the entire framework is fully open-source and commercially usable with attribution, enabling external HPC groups, academic labs, and independent researchers to verify, extend, or reinterpret the results. The work highlights algorithmic design and high-performance optimization as equal pillars of the project, showing how careful engineering can stabilize transcendental computations well beyond typical limits. </p> <p>The entire framework is fully <strong>open-source</strong> and licensed for commercial use with proper attribution, allowing other computational teams to verify, reproduce, and extend the results. The work emphasizes algorithmic engineering, HPC optimization, and reproducibility at extreme numerical scales, demonstrating how modern computational techniques can rigorously support investigations in complex algebraic geometry.</p> <p>We hope this demonstrates what modern computational mathematics can achieve and sparks discussion on algorithmic engineering approaches to classic problems and we can expand the Grand constant Aggregator and possibly proof the Hodge Conjecture. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zero_moo-s\"> /u/zero_moo-s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p44cr8/python_numerical_evidence_max_pslq_to_4000_digits/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p44cr8/python_numerical_evidence_max_pslq_to_4000_digits/\">[comments]</a></span>",
