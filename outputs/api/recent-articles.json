      "title": "Interpretable and Brain-Inspired Recurrent Model of Hierarchical Decision-Making Capturing Trial-by-Trial Variability",
      "content": "Humans often make decisions in hierarchical environments, where low-level perceptual judgments inform high-level strategies. Understanding how the brain computationally navigates such multi-level decisions remains an open challenge. While existing models offer statistical insights, they often fall short in capturing the neural mechanisms and trial-by-trial variability underlying individual choices. To address this gap, we developed a neurocomputational model that integrates a biologically inspired attractor network for low-level perceptual decisions with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for high-level strategic adjustments. With minimal architectural constraints, the RNN receives only raw firing rates, feedback, and prior environment, learning to infer environment-switching strategies without explicit access to confidence or stimulus strength. In a hierarchical task combining motion discrimination and bandit decisions (N = 9; ~10,800 trials), the model successfully reproduced three hallmark behavioral patterns observed in humans. Unlike previous models, the model also captured trial-to-trial variability in switching decisions and implicitly learned to estimate decision confidence. For interpretability, we used representational and sensitivity analyses. Representational analyses revealed internal dynamics consistent with evidence accumulation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), while sensitivity analysis identified feedback as the dominant influence on strategy, modulated by recent trial history. This framework combines interpretability and predictive power, moving beyond simple data fitting to provide mechanistic insights into how the brain integrates confidence and feedback to guide adaptive behavior in hierarchical decision-making.",

      "title": "Cross-task, explainable, and real-time decoding of human emotion states by integrating grey and white matter intracranial neural activity",
      "content": "Decoding human emotion states from neural activity has significant applications in human-computer interfaces, psychiatric diagnostics, and neuromodulation therapies. Intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) provides a promising modality for decoding by balancing temporal, spatial, and noise resolutions. However, real-world application of decoding requires high performance that integrates neural activity from both grey and white matter, stable generalization across different contexts, sufficient neural encoding explainability, and robust real-time implementation, all of which remain elusive. Here, we simultaneously recorded iEEG and abundant self-rated valence and arousal scores--measuring the two primitive dimension of emotion--across two emotion-eliciting tasks in eighteen epilepsy subjects. We developed self-supervised deep learning models that achieved high-performance decoding by integrating grey and white matter signals, generalizing across tasks. The models provided strong explainability by revealing shared and preferred mesolimbic-thalamo-cortical subnetworks encoding valence and arousal, as well as the structural connectivity basis underlying grey and white matter integration. Finally, the models were implemented online and realized robust real-time decoding in four new subjects. Our results have implications for advancing emotion decoding neurotechnology and understanding emotion encoding mechanisms.",

      "title": "Paw posture is a robust indicator for injury, pain, and age.",
      "content": "Inferring biological states from animal behavior is a crucial but challenging step in biomedical discovery that is constrained by variability and labour-intensive assays, even with AI-powered tools. Here, we show that simple images of static paws, analyzed by our custom keypoint segmentation AI-tool provide accurate read-outs for a wide array of physiological states. Without invasive testing, our method detects postural changes associated with nerve injury, acute pain, aging, and the genetic loss of kpna4, a regulator of paw innervation. Leveraging the toe-spread-reflex, a spinal-circuit driven response, the approach requires no habituation and shows low behavioral variability. Individual digits emerge as biomarkers for internal states with digit V indicating neuropathic pain during nerve damage and digit I reflecting loss of kpna4. Our model is freely available and can readily be adapted to other tasks or species. These findings establish unstimulated paw posture as a scaleable, low-cost, readout for biological states.",

      "title": "Non-canonical, ligand-independent basal mGluR1 signaling tunes Kv1.2 surface expression through PKA",
      "content": "Voltage gated potassium channels are major determinants of excitability of Purkinje cell (PC) neurons in the cerebellum. We have previously shown that in the cerebellum, activation of mGluR1 with agonist DHPG leads to reduced surface expression of Kv1.2 and that Kv1.2 co-immunoprecipitates with PKC-{gamma} and CaMKII which are known interactors of mGluR1. However, mGluR1 can also signal independently of agonist through a constitutively active, protein kinase A-dependent pathway. Here we show that in HEK293 cells, co-expression of mGluR1 increases the surface expression levels of Kv1.2. This effect occurs in absence of mGluR1 agonists and in the presence of an mGluR1 inhibitor. Co-expression of known downstream effectors of the agonist driven mGluR1 pathway, including PKC-{gamma} and CaMKII, had no effect on Kv1.2 surface expression or on the ability of mGluR1 agonist to modulate that expression. In contrast, the inverse agonist BAY 36-7620 significantly reduced the mGluR1 effect on Kv1.2 surface expression, as did pharmacological inhibition of PKA with KT5720.",

      "title": "Increased striatal coupling one week after ischemic stroke revealed by ultrafast functional MRI",
      "content": "Background: Network reorganization following ischemic stroke is thought to play a role in recovery. Although cortico-cortical reorganization is widely established, changes in interhemispheric striatal connections following ischemia remain poorly understood, even when stroke occurs in motor areas. Given the importance of the striatum to motor function, we investigated network-level striatal coupling in stroke using ultrafast resting-state fMRI, which has recently been shown to facilitate the dissection of synchronous oscillatory activity better than its conventional ~1 sec time-resolution counterparts. Methods: A cohort of (N=18) sedated rats were randomized and N=9 rats underwent unilateral photothrombotic ischemic lesioning in motor cortex. One week after the lesion, when plasticity and recovery are well established, all animals were scanned on a 9.4T MRI scanner using a cryogenic coil using an ultrafast resting-state functional MRI sequence with temporal resolution of 90 ms. Data were collected for 24 minutes, and spectral power, phase locking, and functional connectivity were quantified. Histology was performed to confirm lesion extent. Results: While cortico-cortical power, connectivity and synchrony were diminished one week post-stroke as expected, we surprisingly found increased striato-striatal power, synchrony and functional connectivity in the stroked group compared with the control group. In stroked animals, the spectral power in the ultraslow oscillation frequency band (0.02-0.4 Hz) significantly increased in the striatum while decreasing in the cortex. When data were undersampled to \"conventional\" fMRI temporal resolution (900 ms), the striatal effects were lost, revealing the power of ultrafast fMRI approaches in unveiling such phenomena. Conclusions: Increased striato-striatal coupling, in the form of increased synchrony, spectral power, and functional connectivity, was revealed by ultrafast resting-state fMRI, but not conventional temporal resolution resting-state fMRI. Our findings suggest more involvement of subcortical areas in network reorganization than previously thought.",

      "title": "Head stabilization behavior and underlying circuit mechanisms in larval zebrafish",
      "content": "Head stabilization is essential for animal survival, enabling stable sensory input and effective motor coordination. Animals stabilize their heads in response to vestibular stimuli through the vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR). While the VCR has been characterized in tetrapod vertebrates, it remains unknown whether fish, which lack an anatomical neck, employ a comparable behavior. Here, we demonstrate that larval zebrafish exhibit VCR-like behaviors: they adjust their head orientation relative to the body by rostral body flexion during pitch tilts. The rostral body flexed ventrally during head-up posture, whereas it flexed dorsally during head-down posture. These flexions partially compensated for the head pitch changes, thereby contributing to head stabilization. We also identified the muscles and neural circuits responsible for these two types of body flexions. Both the dorsal and ventral flexions were mediated by the same vestibular nucleus, but neural signals were transmitted through distinct pathways, either involving or bypassing a class of reticulospinal neurons. The dorsal and ventral flexions were ultimately produced by specialized dorsal and ventral muscles in the rostral body, respectively. The neural circuits underlying these body flexions in fish share similarities with those underlying the mammalian VCR. Together, our results demonstrate that fish exhibit a VCR-like behavior through comparable circuit mechanisms, suggesting that the VCR is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates.",

      "content": "Aging encompasses low-level inflammation and motor decline. Astrocytes are neuroregulatory glial cells that change in aging, particularly in the cerebellum, which is essential for movement coordination. Regulation and functionality of cerebellar astrocytes in aging is unknown. We show that antiviral type I Interferons (IFN-I) drive motor deficits and regional astrocyte aging. Transcriptomics reveal that cerebellar astrocytes, but not cortical, exhibit an antiviral state that intensifies with age, with increased expression of Stat1. Aged mice display motor deficits similar to humans that improve after peripheral IFN-I receptor neutralization, whereas astrocyte Stat1 induces motor deficits during chronic inflammation in adults. While strong systemic inflammation induces astrocyte antiviral state, in aging, chromatin de-repression of Stat1 and nucleotide sensors in cerebellar astrocytes amplifies local IFN-I signaling. We identify functional interaction between a classical immune pathway and astrocytes, representing an actionable strategy to preserve motor function in aging.",

      "content": "Predictive neuroimaging models promise precision medicine but risk exacerbating health inequities if they perform unevenly across ethnic/racial groups. Using the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development data, we benchmarked ethnic/racial bias in models predicting cognitive functioning from 81 MRI phenotypes across four training strategies. Models trained on one ethnicity performed best within that group. Models trained on participants sampled without regard to ethnicity, a common practice, performed better on White participants, likely because the ABCD sample was predominantly White. Training on equal-sized White and African American subsamples reduced disparities without accuracy loss. Structural MRI exhibited the greatest bias, whereas task-based fMRI phenotypes were more equitable. Stronger brain-cognition associations generalized more equitably, but multimodal stacking despite enhancing prediction, did not improve fairness. Increasing representation of African American participants improved performance up to balanced sampling, with diminishing returns beyond. This first modality-wide benchmark reveals pervasive, modality dependent ethnic bias in cognitive prediction and identifies key factors shaping equity in neuroimaging models.",

      "title": "Electrophysiological Brain Connectivity and Subjective States Evoked by Electrical Stimulation of the Human Mediodorsal Thalamus",
      "content": "Recent advances in human intracranial EEG (iEEG) have enabled new investigations into the role of the thalamus in human brain functions. In this study, we applied direct intracranial electrical stimulation (iES) to the mediodorsal (MD) subregion of the thalamus using both high-frequency (50 Hz, iESHF) and low-frequency (0.5 Hz, iESLF) procedures to examine its impact on conscious experience and causal brain connectivity in 30 patients with focal refractory epilepsy (128 electrode contacts). iESHF of the MD elicited reportable changes in conscious experience in 11 of 12 patients (39 sites; 83 stimulations across 27 unique pairs) - predominantly in the visceral, emotional, or somatosensory domains and often described as unpleasant without any lateralization effect. Our connectivity analyses based on iESLF revealed that the cingulate and insular cortices produced stronger electrophysiological responses in the MD (inflow connectivity) than did the sites in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) within the same individuals. Moreover, MD stimulation showed its strongest outflow connectivity to the cingulate, insular, and PFC regions, all significantly stronger than to medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. Notably, inflow from both MTL and insula sites to the MD were significantly stronger than their reverse directions, indicating clear asymmetry in connectivity. These findings provide direct evidence that stimulation of the human thalamus can modulate conscious experience. They also highlight the extensive bidirectional connectivity between the MD and cingulate and insular cortices along with asymmetric connectivity between the MD and MTL and insula sites in the human brain.",

      "title": "Central role for fast nociceptors in mechanical nocifensive behavior and sensitization",
      "content": "Nociceptors, primary afferent nerve fibers that signal noxious stimuli, are broadly divided into slowly conducting unmyelinated C fibers and fast-conducting myelinated A fibers. Whereas C-nociceptors have been extensively studied, considerably less is known about the function of A-nociceptors. To address this gap, we developed an intersectional genetic approach for robust and selective interrogation and manipulation of mechanically responsive A-nociceptors (A-MNs) in mice. Optogenetic A-MN stimulation induced rapid and precise withdrawal reflexes as well as place aversion and facial expression changes consistent with pain affect, while inhibition strongly impaired mechanical nociceptive withdrawal reflexes, demonstrating that A-MNs are necessary and sufficien t for rapid avoidance of noxious mechanical stimuli. Prolonged A-MN activation induced mechanical allodynia and central sensitization. In a rare individual lacking thickly myelinated A{beta} fibers, mechanical withdrawal reflexes were completely absent, and pain perception reduced. Together, these findings identify fast-conducting mechano-nociceptors as essential drivers of nocifensive behaviors in mice and humans.",
