      "title": "Peri-operative pregabalin does not adversely impact experimentaloutcomes in rat models of chronic pain",
      "content": "Introduction: Multiple mechanisms contribute to the experience of pain where the use of model organisms to dissect mechanistically sensory regulatory circuitry is a vital component of discovering underlying causes of persistent pain in disease states. Such disease states can be modelled in animals using surgical procedures that, ethically, should involve administration of analgesia. However, since basic pain researchers often wish to measure pain-related events, animals may be denied peri-operative analgesia to avoid adversely influencing experimental outcomes. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of peri-operative analgesia usage in rat spinal nerve ligation (SNL) and cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) models. Using a combination of behavioural testing and in vivo electrophysiology in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, we assessed the impact of peri-operative pregabalin on nociceptive behaviours in the acute recovery phase, and behavioural and electrophysiological experimental outcomes in the chronic phase, of rat SNL and CIBP models. Results: A literature search revealed that, for studies using rat models of SNL or CIBP, only 5.37 % and 12.69 % respectively reported the use of peri-operative analgesia. We then demonstrated that the use of pregabalin as a peri-operative analgesic reduced mechanical hypersensitivity in the acute period following SNL surgery, with no impact on behavioural, electrophysiological or neuropharmacological outcomes in the chronic phase of either model. Conclusions: This study challenges the basic science researcher's reasoning that peri-operative analgesia confounds neurobiological outcomes. The use of peri-operative analgesia should be an important consideration to improve animal welfare in chronic models of pain.",

      "title": "Neuronal activity promotes repair by microglial reprogramming following demyelination",
      "content": "Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), play a multifaceted role in neurological disorders. In multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease, microglia contribute to inflammation and tissue damage, but can also support repair by clearing myelin debris, limiting inflammation and promoting remyelination and neuroprotection. The timely transition from their pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative states is essential for effective repair and, in chronic MS, persistent, defective microglial activation contributes to disease progression. Yet, the mechanisms underlying the microglial switch remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that neuronal activity can modulate microglial signature at the onset of remyelination in MS models, in a pattern-dependent manner. Transcriptomic analyses reveal a downregulation of pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial signatures alongside an upregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, indicative of a shift toward pro-regenerative states following physiological activity enhancement. This activity-dependent reprogramming also extends to infiltrating monocytes and macrophages, collectively fostering a microenvironment favoring repair.",

      "title": "The transcription factor BCL11A restores differentiation potential to aged oligodendrocyte progenitor cells",
      "content": "In young animals, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) undergo robust differentiation, progressing through stages to become pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes (Pre-OL) and ultimately myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs). However, OPCs from aged animals have reduced differentiation ability. This disrupts myelin maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a lack of remyelination following demyelinating injury and impaired adaptive myelination as a mechanism of learning. To uncover novel factors essential for restoring resilience in aged OPCs, we employed a data-driven approach involving the development of a computational pipeline, gSWITCH (accessible at: https://altoslabs.shinyapps.io/gSWITCH/), that allows for capture of precise dynamic gene expression patterns to pinpoint potential 'switch' genes during lineage progression. Using gSWITCH to identify potential switch genes crucial for OPCs, we conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in OPCs isolated from young and aged animals. This revealed a group of transcription factors with decreased expression in aged OPCs. Further analysis of transcription factor binding site enrichment in OPC switches highlighted Bcl11a, a zinc finger transcription factor that could potentially serve as a master regulator of many switch genes. Ectopic overexpression of Bcl11a in aged OPCs did not enhance their proliferation; however, it significantly enhanced their differentiation into OLs. Overexpression of Bcl11a in aged mice, followed by demyelination injury in spinal cord white matter, significantly increased the differentiation of OPCs into OLs within the injury region compared to control aged mice. Furthermore, we found that Bcl11a is absent in invertebrates and has undergone pervasive purifying selection throughout vertebrate evolution, constraining its amino-acid sequence by eliminating deleterious mutations. Our study shows that reversing the age-related decline of this evolutionarily conserved factor in aged OPCs restores their impaired capacity for differentiation.",

      "content": "Experimental advancements in neuroscience have identified cellular engrams - ensembles of neurons whose activation is necessary and sufficient for memory retrieval. Synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation, is key to memory encoding and recall, but the relationship between learning-induced dendritic spine potentiation and neuron-wide activation remains unclear. Here, we employ a post-synaptic translation-dependent potentiation reporter (SA-PSD{Delta}Venus) and a neuronal activation reporter (ESARE-dTurquoise) to determine their spatiotemporal correlation in the mouse hippocampal CA1 following contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Potentiated spines were enriched in activated neurons, with distribution varying across CA1 layers at different phases of memory: potentiated spines were more frequent in activated neurons in stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum moleculare after CFC (encoding), while recall-activated neurons showed a larger number of potentiated spines in the stratum radiatum. These findings demonstrate that the relative weight and spatial distribution of potentiated synaptic inputs to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons changes between the encoding and retrieval phases of memory.",

      "title": "Hippocampal Drift Rate Reflects the Temporal Organization of Memories",
      "content": "<p>When freely recalling past events, individuals tend to successively remember stimuli that were studied close together in time&mdash;a phenomenon known as temporal clustering. Temporal clustering is thought to occur because stimuli are encoded in relation to a slowly drifting internal context; this internal context representation is then reinstated during recall, leading to clustered recall of stimuli that share a similar internal context. While several lines of evidence implicate the hippocampus in supporting internal context representations, there is limited evidence directly linking hippocampal drift during memory encoding to subsequent temporal clustering during recall. In a human fMRI experiment (<i>n</i> = 38; 20 females and 18 males), we sought to influence the rate of internal context change during memory encoding and tested for corresponding effects on (1) temporal clustering and (2) hippocampal drift rate. To influence internal context, we manipulated the rate at which background scenes \"switched\" while a list of words was encoded. Afterward, subjects freely recalled as many words as possible. While switch rate had no effect on the total number of words recalled, it significantly influenced the degree of temporal clustering. Specifically, a higher switch rate was associated with less temporal clustering. Strikingly, this pattern was mirrored by drift rate in the hippocampus: a higher switch rate was associated with significantly lower hippocampal autocorrelation (more drift). Moreover, individual differences in hippocampal autocorrelation were positively correlated with temporal clustering. Collectively, this suggests that hippocampal drift rate during encoding and temporal clustering during recall each reflects a common internal context representation.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Exposure to loud and/or prolonged noise damages the cochlea and triggers downstream brain changes, resulting in hearing loss and altered speech comprehension. It remains unclear however whether noise exposure also compromises the cochlear efferent system; a feedback pathway originates in the brain that fine-tunes hearing sensitivity in the cochlea. Recent evidence suggests that lateral olivocochlear (LOC) efferent system supports hearing recovery by sustaining auditory nerve activity for several weeks after acoustic trauma (Sitko et al., 2025); however, the underlying neural mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. To address this gap, we examined the long-term effects of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) on the spontaneous action potential (AP) firing pattern in mouse LOC neurons of either sex. Under normal conditions, these neurons display a characteristic burst firing pattern driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated membrane voltage oscillations. One week following noise exposure, hearing thresholds were significantly elevated, and the duration of AP bursts was increased, as a result of an enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current. Moreover, LOC neurons exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents&mdash;a key process that shapes the duration of voltage oscillations&mdash;whose properties were also modified following noise exposure. Interestingly, our data suggest that the interplay between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation, CDI, and outward leak currents is sufficient to sustain the oscillating behavior of LOC neurons. We propose that NIHL increases efferent activity, thereby enhancing the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, which may support long-lasting restoration of sensory coding in the damaged cochlea.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Listeners effortlessly extract multi-dimensional auditory objects, such as a localized talker, from complex acoustic scenes. However, the neural mechanisms that enable simultaneous encoding and linking of distinct sound features&mdash;such as a talker&rsquo;s voice and location&mdash;are not fully understood. Using invasive intracranial recordings in seven neurosurgical patients (four male, three female), we investigated how the human auditory cortex processes and integrates these features during naturalistic multi-talker scenes and how attentional mechanisms modulate such feature integration. We found that cortical sites exhibit a continuum of feature sensitivity, ranging from single-feature-sensitive sites (responsive primarily to voice spectral features or to location features) to dual-feature-sensitive sites (responsive to both features). At the population level, neural response patterns from both single- and dual-feature-sensitive sites jointly encoded the attended talker&rsquo;s voice and location. Notably, single-feature-sensitive sites encoded their primary feature with greater precision but also represented coarse information about the secondary feature. Sites selectively tracking a single, attended speech stream concurrently encoded both voice and location features, demonstrating a link between selective attention and feature integration. Additionally, attention selectively enhanced temporal coherence between voice- and location-sensitive sites, suggesting that temporal synchronization serves as a mechanism for linking these features. Our findings highlight two complementary neural mechanisms&mdash;joint population coding and temporal coherence&mdash;that enable the integration of voice and location features in the auditory cortex. These results provide new insights into the distributed, multi-dimensional nature of auditory object formation during active listening in complex environments.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Gating processes that regulate sensory input into visual working memory (WM) and the execution of planned actions share neural mechanisms, suggesting a mutual interaction. In a preregistered study (Open Science Framework), we examined how this interaction may result in sensory interference during WM storage using a delayed match-to-sample task. Participants (12 males, 20 females) memorized the color of a target stimulus for later report on a color wheel. The shape of the target indicated which hand they would adjust the color wheel with. During the retention interval, an interference task was presented, requiring a response with either the same or different hand as the main task. In half of the interference trials, the interfering task cue was also colored to introduce visual interference. EEG results showed early motor planning during sensory encoding, evidenced by mu/beta suppression contralateral to the responding hand. The interference task only impaired WM performance when it included an irrelevant color, indicating that the interference effect was primarily driven by the irrelevant sensory information. In addition, color reporting in the WM task was biased toward the irrelevant color. This was more pronounced when both tasks were performed with the same hand, suggesting a selective gating mechanism dependent on motor control processes. This effect was mitigated by a control mechanism, which was evident in frontal theta activity, where higher power predicted lower bias on the single-trial level. Our findings thus reveal that sensory WM updating can be induced by interfering motor actions, which can be compensated by a reactive control mechanism.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a critical tool for assessing auditory brainstem function in biomedical mouse models. Remarkably, despite its importance, the origins of ABR waves specific to mice remain poorly identified. Here, we used EEG source reconstruction to reevaluate the mouse-specific ABR origins. We recorded the topography of ABRs using high-density EEG from the skull of adult mice of either sex combined with parallel multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex. Individual ABR waves showed a series of distinct spatial topographies across the skull. Wave I&rsquo; was strongly lateralized, supporting its auditory nerve origin. Waves II/III were also lateralized but had a more frontal distribution, supporting an origin in the cochlear nucleus and olivary complex. A distinct shift in wave IV topography showed focused activity directly above the inferior colliculus (IC). Source localization with beamforming supported the origin of wave IV and V in the IC. In addition, the slow IC wave, P<sub>0</sub>, temporally overlapped with responses in the auditory cortex. We identify ABR wave IV as a marker of IC activity, separating earlier brainstem contributions (cochlear nucleus, olivary complex) from later thalamic and cortical components. This finding improves the anatomical specificity of the mouse ABR as a noninvasive marker in biomedical mouse models.</p>",

      "title": "Altered Electrophysiology and Transcriptome of GnRH Neurons in Middle-Aged Female Mice",
      "content": "<p>Aging affects the reproductive system, although its impact on GnRH neurons is mainly unexplored. Thus, we compared the transcriptome and electrophysiology of GnRH neurons obtained from female middle-aged (MA, 400&ndash;430&nbsp;d) and young (Y, 70&nbsp;d), diestrous mice, respectively. Transcriptomic analysis revealed reproductive senescence-related molecular changes in one-third of the MA mice. The upregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 225) were linked to immune signaling, olfactory- and vomeronasal receptors. The downregulated genes (<i>n</i> = 233) were related to mRNA processing, G-protein&ndash;coupled receptors, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport, and estrogen signaling. In addition, ion channel (Na, K, Ca), neurotransmitter (ACh, GABA, glutamate), and various neuropeptide receptor-coding genes showed differential expression indicating functional alterations of the cells. Accordingly, whole-cell patch&ndash;clamp recordings revealed a twofold increase in spontaneous firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons. Significant changes were also observed in characteristics of action potentials and afterhyperpolarization amplitudes. Conspicuously, miniature postsynaptic currents were absent in 72% of MA-GnRH neurons, and pharmacological blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> and glutamate receptors didn't affect the firing rate. However, administration of their ligands evoked inward currents and facilitated firing in both animal groups, although with a decreased efficacy in MA animals. MA-GnRH neurons sustained responsiveness to estradiol, G-protein inhibition, and kisspeptin (KP) like those of young animals. While KP receptor antagonist, KP-234, diminished firing frequency of MA-GnRH neurons, it had no effect on young GnRH cells. Collectively, these findings revealed that both the transcriptome and electrophysiological activity of GnRH neurons change at middle age and the explored alterations are hallmarks of early phase of reproductive senescence.</p>",

      "title": "Disentangling the Functional Roles of Premotor-Motor Pathways in Automatic Imitation: A Combined Network-Based Transcranial Stimulation and Drift Diffusion Modeling Approach",
      "content": "<p>Humans have an automatic tendency to imitate others&rsquo; actions, a process facilitated by the action observation network (AON). While motor nodes of the AON, such as the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and the supplementary motor area (SMA), are engaged during automatic imitation, the distinct roles of their projections to the primary motor cortex (M1) remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the plasticity and functional role of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in healthy humans of either sex. We used a combination of corticocortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) to modulate cortical connectivity strength and drift diffusion modeling to study the impact of ccPAS on the latent cognitive processes underlying automatic imitation. Our results show that manipulating PMv-to-M1 connectivity increases the baseline tendency to imitate actions, shifting the response toward or away from an imitative response when connectivity in this circuit is enhanced or hindered, respectively. Conversely, strengthening SMA-to-M1 connectivity does not affect this bias but improves contextual information integration, facilitating task-appropriate behavior, reflected by the drift rate parameter. These findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the functional roles of PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways: the former pathway drives the automatic imitation bias, while the latter modulates the integration of contextual information to regulate imitation. By combining network-based brain stimulation with advanced behavioral analysis, this study provides causal evidence for the distinct cognitive functions supported by the PMv-to-M1 and SMA-to-M1 pathways in the facilitation and regulation of automatic imitation. Our findings offer insights into the neural mechanisms governing imitation and its context-dependent modulation.</p>",

      "title": "Superior Colliculus Projections Drive Dopamine Neuron Activity and Movement But Not Value",
      "content": "<p>To navigate dynamic environments, animals must rapidly integrate sensory information and respond appropriately to gather rewards and avoid threats. It is well established that dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) are key for creating associations between environmental stimuli (i.e., cues) and the outcomes they predict. Critically, it remains unclear how sensory information is integrated into DA pathways. The superior colliculus (SC) receives direct visual input and is positioned as a relay for DA neuron augmentation. We characterized the anatomy and functional impact of SC projections to the VTA/SNc in male and female rats. First, we show that neurons in the deep layers of SC synapse densely throughout the ventral midbrain, interfacing with projections to the striatum and ventral pallidum, and these SC projections excite DA and GABA neurons in the VTA/SNc in vivo. Despite this, cues predicting SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neuron activation did not reliably evoke behavior in an optogenetic pavlovian conditioning paradigm, and activation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons did not support primary reinforcement or produce place preference/avoidance. Instead, we find that stimulation of SC-&gt;VTA/SNc neurons evokes head turning. Focusing optogenetic activation solely onto DA neurons that receive input from the SC was sufficient to invigorate turning, but not reinforcement. Turning intensity increased with repeated stimulations, suggesting that this circuit may underlie sensorimotor learning for exploration and attentional switching. Together, our results show that collicular neurons contribute to cue-guided behaviors by controlling pose adjustments through interaction with DA neurons that preferentially engage movement instead of reward.</p>",
