      "title": "Neuronal PARIS-STAT3 axis drives tau pathology and glial activation in Alzheimers disease",
      "content": "PARIS, a substrate of Parkin, accumulates in Parkinsons disease and promotes disease progression. Here, we demonstrate that PARIS also contributes to Alzheimers disease by elevating STAT3 transcriptional activity, thereby inducing tau pathology, hippocampal atrophy, and glial activation. Genetic depletion of Paris reduced tau phosphorylation and cognitive decline in tauopathy mice, whereas neuron-specific PARIS overexpression caused tau accumulation, gliosis, and memory impairment. In contrast, astrocyte-specific overexpression did not induce pathology, indicating that PARIS acts in neurons to drive tau phosphorylation and glial activation. The pathological features induced by neuronal PARIS overexpression were rescued by STAT3 inhibition, demonstrating that PARIS and STAT3 signaling underlies these effects. Moreover, Paris knockout did not alter pathology in the amyloid-driven mouse model, highlighting specificity for tau pathology. Together, these findings reveal PARIS as a neuronal regulator of STAT3 signaling that exacerbates tau-mediated neurodegeneration and identify the PARIS and STAT3 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimers disease.",

      "title": "Forward-projected cortical eigenmodes provide an efficient sensor-space representation of resting-state EEG",
      "content": "Sensor-space EEG analyses typically rely on electrode layouts or data-driven components and rarely encode cortical geometry, which makes scalp patterns difficult to link to anatomy and to compare across participants. We introduce a sensor-space basis dictionary that explicitly incorporates cortical geometry. Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigenmodes are computed on a standard cortical template (fsaverage) and mapped through the lead-field matrix of a three-layer boundary-element head model to yield cortex-anchored sensor-space harmonics. This leadfield-mapped LB dictionary spans scalp topographies while preserving a meaningful spatial-frequency ordering inherited from the cortical manifold. We assess representational efficiency using ordinary least squares projections of resting EEG (eyes closed and eyes open) across 59-, 32-, and 19-channel montages, and compare against spherical harmonics (SPH), principal components (PCA), and independent components (ICA). Efficiency is quantified by the variance explained (R-squared) by the leading K modes, and by two efficiency indices, K70 and K90, defined as the smallest number of modes needed to reach at least 70% and 90% of the variance. Reliability is quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient ICC(3,1) for eyes-open versus eyes-closed coefficients. The cortex-anchored basis shows higher early-K variance explained (R-squared) than SPH and PCA (for example, in 59-channel eyes-closed data at the number of modes K = 4, LB achieves an R-squared of about 0.56 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.59], compared with SPH about 0.44 [0.42, 0.46] and PCA about 0.08 [0.07, 0.09]) and reaches 70% and 90% variance with fewer modes (LB K70 about 8.6 versus SPH 12.3, PCA 19.3, ICA 22.8; LB K90 about 22.6 versus SPH 25.3, PCA 23.2, ICA 30.2). Mode-wise coefficient reliability is comparable between LB and SPH. By combining cortical eigenmodes with a forward head model, this approach provides a geometry-aligned, interpretable representation of sensor-space EEG that offers superior fidelity-complexity trade-offs at small K and a principled scaffold for low-dimensional EEG sensor-space analysis.",

      "title": "Critical spatial separation at the scale of V1 receptive fields determines motion segmentation",
      "content": "Integrating elements that belong to a single object while segregating overlapping objects is a fundamental challenge for the visual system, exemplified by the phenomenon of motion transparency. While the middle temporal (MT) cortex is central to motion processing, the role of V1 in motion transparency remains controversial. It is still unclear at what spatial scale segmentation for motion transparency occurs. To address these questions, we conducted human psychophysics experiments using locally paired-dot stimuli moving in two directions separated by 90{degrees}. Subjects performed a 3AFC task to report whether the visual stimulus had no motion, a single direction, or two distinct directions. We systematically manipulated the path length of the dots, and therefore, the spatial separation between the paired dots, and the retinal eccentricity of the visual stimulus. We found that as the spatial separation between the paired dots increased, subjects perception shifted from a single direction to two distinct directions. Critically, we found that the spatial separation required for this perceptual transition increased with the eccentricity and closely matched the known receptive field sizes of V1 neurons at those eccentricities. Direction segmentation occurred only when the spatial separation between motion components exceeded the V1 receptive field size. Conversely, direction integration occurred when the spatial separation was smaller than the V1 receptive field size. Our results demonstrate that the receptive field size of V1 neurons sets the critical spatial scale for direction segmentation and suggest that V1 plays a key role in motion transparency and, more generally, in motion segmentation.",
