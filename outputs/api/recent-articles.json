      "title": "MicroRNA-21-3p regulation of NOX4 and VEGFA contributes to hemorrhage in cerebral cavernous malformations",
      "content": "Objective: MicroRNAs regulate the brain vascular integrity and are involved in the lesion development of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM). This study examines the role of microRNA-21-3p in CCM-related cerebral hemorrhage and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: The expression of miRNA-21-3p and its target genes of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and pericytes were assessed in cavernous malformation lesions of 20 sporadic CCM patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The association of their expression with hemorrhage manifestation was evaluated. Cell proliferation, permeability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), migration, tubule formation, and the expression of NOX4 and VEGFA were assessed in CCM2 gene-depleted human BMECs and pericytes after miRNA-21-3p intervention. Cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, and angiogenesis after miRNA-21-3p intervention were evaluated in the ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish. Results: Decreased miRNA-21-3p and increased NOX4 and VEGFA were shown in BMECs and pericytes of the CCM lesions compared to peri-lesion normal vessels from epilepsy patients, which were also correlated with the presence of cerebral hemorrhage in CCM patients. Increasing miRNA-21-3p attenuated cell proliferation, permeability, ROS expression, cell migration, and tubule formation by targeting NOX4 and VEGFA in CCM2 gene-depleted BMECs and pericytes. In vivo studies revealed that increasing miRNA-21-3p reduced cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, angiogenesis, and the overexpression of nox4 and vegfa in ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish. Conclusion: MiRNA-21-3p can be a novel therapeutic target by regulating NOX4 and VEGFA, thereby stabilizing vascular integrity and reducing cerebral hemorrhage in CCM lesions.",

      "title": "The alternated brain states in resting state after immoral decisions",
      "content": "Immoral decisions, which engage both cognitive control and reward system, bring both cognitive and neural consequences. However, how dishonesty has an impact on the brain's dynamic alterations is still unclear. In this work, we attempt to understand the impact of immoral decisions on the brain states' dynamics using both resting-state and task-state fMRI data collected before, during, and after an information-passing task involving dishonest choices with rewards. We employed the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the changes in the brain dynamics state, in which the changes that happen between pre- and post-task are hypothesized to be linked to behavior and brain dynamics during the task. First, we identified 4 intrinsic brain states across both resting scans and task scans, including one reward state (state 1) and one control network (state 3). The fractional occupancy (FO) of the control network decreased after the task, and subsequent analysis showed that it was linked to brain dynamics during the task: as dishonesty persisted, FO of the control network decreased while FO of the reward network increased. Moreover, the post-task control network was negatively correlated with motivated dishonesty, suggesting that stronger control network recruitment counteracts immoral tendencies. In contrast, early in the task, the reward network positively correlated with motivated dishonesty, indicating that the representation and sensitivity to reward attribution were tied to dishonest choices. A complementary analysis using drift diffusion modeling confirmed that the reward network tracked the weightings placed on monetary rewards, and the level of activation of the reward network before the task is associated with a bias in dishonesty. Together, these findings suggest that the 'post-moral decision brain' operates not as a static system but as a set of dynamically shifting states, whose adaptive trajectories may underlie the lasting effect of moral erosion during sustained dishonest behavior.",

      "title": "The Human Brain's Action Network Affinity",
      "content": "This study proposes a novel spatiotemporal connectome-based framework to characterize the human brain's action network, namely network affinity, moving beyond traditional static temporal connectivity measures by leveraging full functional connectivity profiles on large-scale neural wave dynamics. We applied this method to map the action network for the first time in a non-Western young adult cohort from the Chinese Human Connectome Project (CHCP). Our results delineate the action network's detailed functional affinity architecture, capturing its integrative topology across the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical nuclei, and its characteristic anticorrelation with the default network. All the findings are replicated in HCP samples. Crucially, all derived high-resolution action network affinity maps and the associated computational code are publicly shared to foster open science and reproducibility (https://ccndc.scidb.cn/en). This work provides a foundational atlas and a new analytical approach, establishing a critical resource for future basic research across diverse populations and lifespans. It also holds significant translational potential for understanding and treating neurological and psychiatric disorders affecting goal-directed behavior, such as apathy and Parkinson's disease.",

      "title": "Intravenous Administration of Serotonergic Psychedelics Produce Short-lasting Changes in Sleep-Wake Behavior and High Gamma Functional Connectivity in Rats",
      "content": "Background and Purpose: Given the increase in recreational psychedelic use and ongoing efforts to explore psychedelics as therapeutic agents for mental health disorders, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of psychedelics such as psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on sleep-wake states, which share a bidirectional relationship with mental health. Here, we investigated the effects of intravenous psilocybin and DMT on sleep-wake states and EEG spectral power and functional connectivity in rats. Experimental Approach: Sprague Dawley rats (n=25, 13 male) were surgically instrumented to record high-density EEG (27 electrodes) and EMG during 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle after intravenous psilocybin (2.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg), DMT (3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline. The EEG/EMG data were scored in 4-second epochs into wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. EEG spectral power and corticocortical coherence, a surrogate for functional connectivity, were computed in 12-second epochs. Key Results: Psilocybin and DMT delayed the onset of SWS and REM sleep, and caused a short-lasting increase in wakefulness and decrease in SWS. Psilocybin also produced a 1) decrease in REM sleep, 2) decrease in theta power and coherence and increase in high gamma power and coherence during wake and SWS, and 3) increase in high gamma coherence during REM sleep. DMT increased gamma coherence only during wakefulness. Conclusions and Implications: Serotonergic psychedelics have minimal effects on sleep-wake states. The enhanced high gamma functional connectivity suggests that the psychedelic-induced changes in EEG/neural dynamics can occur independent of the arousal states.",

      "title": "Developmental CA2 perineuronal net reduction restores social memory in Shank3B KO mice",
      "content": "Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental conditions, like Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS), exhibit social recognition deficits. Previous reports using Shank3B knockout (KO) mice, a genetic model with relevance to ASD and PMDS, revealed deficits in social memory in adulthood, but the postnatal onset and mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. In the hippocampus, area CA2 contributes to the emergence of social memory during development and remains important for this ability through the lifespan. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures, support social memory in CA2 and help orchestrate critical periods of plasticity in other brain regions. We found that Shank3B KO pups exhibit specific deficits in short-term social recognition and social novelty preference, which become evident at the end of the second postnatal week and persist into adulthood along with CA2 network aberrations. Excessive PNNs in area CA2 were detected in KO pups at the postnatal time when social recognition function typically emerges in healthy pups. This time was also characterized by greater sequestration of the guidance cue semaphorin-3A (sema3A) and overgrowth of afferents from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in KOs, suggesting that inordinate PNNs during a sensitive period may disorganize developing CA2 circuitry. Reduction of CA2 PNN levels prior to the onset of social dysfunction recovered social recognition function during development, as well as reduced sema3A and SuM inputs to the CA2. The restoration of behavioral function persisted into adulthood along with partial normalization of CA2 network activity. Together, these findings reveal how excess PNN formation in the developing hippocampus may give rise to impaired social memory by disrupting afferent input, effects that are reversible by early life intervention.",

      "title": "Brain-to-text decoding with context-aware neural representations and large language models",
      "content": "Objective. Decoding attempted speech from neural activity offers a promising avenue for restoring communication abilities in individuals with speech impairments. Previous studies have focused on mapping neural activity to text using phonemes as the intermediate target. While successful, decoding neural activity directly to phonemes ignores the context dependent nature of the neural activity-to-phoneme mapping in the brain, leading to suboptimal decoding performance. Approach. In this work, we propose the use of diphone\u2014an acoustic representation that captures the transitions between two phonemes\u2014as the context-aware modeling target. We integrate diphones into existing phoneme decoding frameworks through a novel divide-and-conquer strategy in which we model the phoneme distribution by marginalizing over the diphone distribution. Our approach effectively leverages the enhanced context-aware representation of diphones while preserving the manageable class size of phonemes, a key factor in simplifying the subsequent phoneme-to-text conversion task. Main results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Brain-to-Text 2024 benchmark, where it achieves state-of-the-art phoneme error rate (PER) of 15.34% compared to 16.62% PER of monophone-based decoding. When coupled with finetuned large language models (LLMs), our method yields a Word error rate (WER) of 5.77%, significantly outperforming the 8.93% WER of the leading method in the benchmark. Significance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging context-aware neural representations and LLMs for brain-to-text decoding, thereby expanding the capabilities of speech neuroprostheses and paving the way toward restoring communication in individuals with speech impairments.",

      "content": "<p>Hey HN! We're Wen and Tobias, and we're building Metorial (<a href=\"https://metorial.com\">https://metorial.com</a>), an integration platform that connects AI agents to external tools and data using MCP.<p>The Problem: While MCP works great locally (e.g., Cursor or Claude Desktop), server-side deployments are painful. Running MCP servers means managing Docker configs, per-user OAuth flows, scaling concurrent sessions, and building observability from scratch. This infrastructure work turns simple integrations into weeks of setup.<p>Metorial handles all of this automatically. We maintain an open catalog of ~600 MCP servers (GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, Salesforce, databases, etc.) that you can deploy in three clicks. You can also bring your own MCP server or fork existing ones.<p>For OAuth, just provide your client ID and secret and we handle the entire flow, including token refresh. Each user then gets an isolated MCP server instance configured with their own OAuth credentials automatically.<p>What makes us different is that our serverless runtime hibernates idle MCP servers and resumes them with sub-second cold starts while preserving the state and connection. Our custom MCP engine is capable of managing thousands of concurrent connections, giving you a scalable service with per-user isolation. Other alternatives either run shared servers (security issues) or provision separate VMs per user (expensive and slow to scale).<p>Our Python and TypeScript SDKs let you connect LLMs to MCP tools in a single function call, abstracting away the protocol complexity. But if you want to dig deep, you can just use standard MCP and our REST API (<a href=\"https://metorial.com/api\">https://metorial.com/api</a>) to connect to our platform.<p>You can self-host (<a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial</a>) or use the managed version at <a href=\"https://metorial.com\">https://metorial.com</a>.<p>So far, we see enterprise teams use Metorial to have a central integration hub for tools like Salesforce, while startups use it to cut weeks of infra work on their side when building AI agents with integrations.<p>Demo video: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07StSRNmJZ8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07StSRNmJZ8</a><p>Our Repos: Metorial: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial</a>, MCP Containers: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/mcp-containers\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/mcp-containers</a><p>SDKs: Node/TypeScript: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial-node\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial-node</a>, Python: <a href=\"https://github.com/metorial/metorial-python\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/metorial/metorial-python</a><p>We'd love to hear feedback, especially if you've dealt with deploying MCP at scale!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45580771\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45580771</a></p>\n<p>Points: 8</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Change detection of social cues across individuals plays an important role in human interaction. Here we investigated the automatic change detection of facial and vocal attractiveness in 19 female participants by recording ERPs. We adopted a 'deviant-standard-reverse' oddball paradigm where high- or low-attractive items were embedded as deviants in a sequence of opposite attractive standard stimuli. Both high- and low-attractive faces and voices elicited mismatch negativities (MMNs). Furthermore, low-attractive versus high-attractive items induced larger mismatch negativities in the voice condition but larger P3 amplitudes in the face condition. These data indicate that attractiveness can be automatically detected but that differences exist between facial and vocal attractiveness processing. Generally, change detection seems to work better for unattractive than attractive information possibly in line with a negativity bias.",

      "content": "Electronic skins (e-skins) incorporating island architectures represent a promising platform for strain-insensitive tactile sensing by mechanically decoupling sensing units from deformations. However, conventional island designs encounter stress concentration issues caused by inherent modulus mismatches, critically limiting achievable island densities. This limitation forces a stubborn trade-off between strain-insensitivity and sensing resolution. Here, inspired by the entangled elastin networks...",

However, conventional tactile sensor arrays face inherent trade-offs between spatial resolution, sensitivity, and crosstalk suppression due to microstructure size limitations and signal interference. To address this, we developed a tactile sensor featuring 10 \u03bcm-scale pyramid tips that achieve ultra-high sensitivity (8.082 kPa^(-1) in 0.2-0.5 kPa range). By integrating a...",
