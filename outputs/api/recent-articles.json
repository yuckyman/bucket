      "title": "A meningeal circadian clock and brain state co-ordinately enhance macromolecular clearance during wake",
      "content": "The removal of brain waste is thought to be regulated by the circadian clock and sleep-wake cycle. A meningeal scavenger cell population, called mural Lymphatic Endothelial Cells (muLECs), uptake macromolecules from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and are poised to clear soluble brain waste. Whether CSF clearance is regulated across the 24-hour day is unknown. Using a quantitative, in vivo assay in zebrafish, we show that the capacity of muLECs to remove macromolecules is highest during the waking day. The muLEC protein uptake is regulated by a cell-autonomous circadian oscillator that drives rhythmic protein levels of Mannose Receptor 1a (Mrc1a); in contrast, lipoprotein uptake increases as a function of time spent awake. Thus, circadian and brain state cues independently maximize muLEC function during wake. Consistently, muLECs are required for normal recovery after the heightened metabolic demand of a seizure, suggesting that muLEC clearance contributes to both normal and disrupted brain homeostasis.",

      "title": "Sex-specific effects of psychoactive drugs on memory performance in an animal model of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
      "content": "Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in working memory (WM) and executive control. Dysregulation of the Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)/p35 signaling pathway has been implicated in ADHD pathophysiology due to its impact on neuronal connectivity and dopamine regulation. Using p35 knockout (p35KO) mice, a validated model exhibiting ADHD-like phenotypes, we investigated sex-specific WM performance, neuronal activation patterns, and responses to acute treatment with methylphenidate (MPH) or fluoxetine (FLX), administered alone or in combination. Under basal conditions, p35KO mice of both sexes exhibited significant WM impairment in the Y-maze test compared with wild type (WT) counterparts, whereas recognition memory remained intact. Analysis of neuronal activation (c-Fos-IR) 90 minutes after testing revealed region- and sex-dependent alterations. p35KO males showed significantly reduced c-Fos-IR expression in prefrontal cortical regions, while both sexes exhibited increased c-Fos-IR in hippocampal regions. Acute MPH or FLX treatment significantly improved WM in p35KO males, but this benefit was lost with the combined treatment (MPH+FLX). In contrast, p35KO females showed no WM improvement with any treatment. Notably, WT females exhibited a pronounced decline in WM after exposure to MPH, FLX, or their combination, indicating sex-specific pharmacological sensitivity in healthy animals. These findings highlight the critical role of Cdk5/p35 signaling in maintaining the functional balance between prefrontal and hippocampal networks. Our results demonstrate that pharmacological responses in this ADHD model are highly sensitive to both sex and neurobiological background, emphasizing the importance of considering sex as a biological variable in preclinical and translational ADHD research.",

      "title": "Distinct mechanisms mediate dopamine-octopamine opponency in an insect model of olfaction",
      "content": "Neuromodulators play a key role in determining how an organism processes and responds to sensory cues. Often, different neuromodulators act on the same set of neural circuits to produce diverging behavioral outcomes. In this study, we examined how dopamine and octopamine alter odor-driven neural activity in a peripheral olfactory circuit (the antennal lobe) and thereby alter behavioral responses in an opposing manner. Our results indicate that dopamine suppressed GABAergic local neuron activity during odor stimulation. Releasing the antennal lobe network from inhibition increased the principal neural activity for all odorants and led to nonspecific increases in a behavioral appetitive response. Octopamine, on the other hand, did not alter the GABAergic inhibition in the antennal lobe but still reduced the odor-evoked principal neural activity and the behavioral responses elicited by all odorants. Thus, both dopamine and octopamine used distinct mechanisms (altering recurrent inhibition vs intrinsic excitability) to mediate opponent changes in odor-evoked neural activity and behavioral outcomes.",

      "title": "Comparative Study of BBB-Targeting AAV Capsids on Central Nervous System Delivery Efficiency",
      "content": "The efficacy of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated systemic gene therapy for central nervous system (CNS) diseases is often limited by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This study systematically evaluated the tissue distribution of three BBB-crossing AAV capsid variants (PHP.eB, CNSRCV300, and BI-hTFR1) following intravenous injection in mice, using either a constitutive promoter (CAG) or a neuron-specific promoter (hSyn) to drive EGFP reporter expression. Compared with AAV9, both PHP.eB and CNSRCV300 demonstrated significantly enhanced BBB penetration and brain transduction efficiency. While the use of the hSyn promoter led to reduced transgene expression in the brain compared with the CAG promoter, and substantially decreased visible reporter expression in peripheral organs, viral deposition in the liver could still be detected via immunohistochemistry. Overall, CNSRCV300 exhibited the most favorable balance between brain-targeting efficiency and biosafety, highlighting its potential as a promising delivery vector. In summary, both the capsid and promoter jointly influence AAV-mediated expression in vivo, and although cell type-specific promoters can reduce off-target expression, residual viral deposition in non-target tissues remains a potential safety concern.",

      "title": "Decision revisions modulated by synaptic inhibition in the olfactory bulb facilitate learning",
      "content": "Behavioral responses are preceded by decisions based on perceived sensory evidence. In real life, sensory inputs are often noisy and change incessantly, raising the question of when and how accurate decisions are made. Cognitive flexibility allows us to revise the choices in case of perceptual conflicts, leading to response revisions. This involves switching between available choices or rapidly stopping misconstrued responses. Here, we quantified these erroneous behavioral actions and studied the underlying neural mechanisms. Mice were trained on an olfactory decision-making task wherein they had to distinguish between a rewarded and an unrewarded stimulus by responding with a lick or withholding it. While the animals respond by licking for both rewarded and unrewarded odor stimuli at the initial stages of learning, the responses almost disappear for the unrewarded ones in the learned stage. However, animals tend to initiate lick responses and stop within a few milliseconds for a few unrewarded trials, even when accuracy levels are high. We describe this phenomenon as decision revisions (DR), and observed it in 5-25% of trials among high-performance blocks. These revisions were mostly observed within a few hundred milliseconds of stimulation. We observed a significantly higher number of revision trials for binary odor mixture discriminations compared to monomolecular ones. Further, by enhancing inhibitory synaptic signaling in the olfactory bulb through photoactivation of ChR2-expressing GAD65-positive GABAergic interneurons, we observed faster odor discrimination and fewer revision trials. Thus, our findings confirm decision revisions that are stimulus complexity-dependent and the pre-cortical control over such a complex cognitive activity.",

      "content": "The integration of mobile robots into human environments requires that they behave in trustworthy ways. Trust develops through interaction, and erratic movements can easily break it. Previous research examined motion predictability and smoothness separately, but their combined effect remains unclear. We investigated how predictability (consistent versus random) and smoothness (gradual versus abrupt) influence human trust and emotion during collision avoidance in virtual reality. Twenty-six participants encountered a robot across repeated trials. We measured subjective valence, arousal, and trust, along with skin conductance responses. Predictability dominated the results. Consistent robot behavior led to increased trust and positive feelings over time. Conversely, unpredictable behavior kept trust low. Smoothness acted mainly as a moderator for arousal; smooth paths reduced the stress caused by unpredictable moves. We also found that prolonged proximity in gradual movements raised physiological arousal, even if users reported feeling calm. These findings suggest predictability drives social acceptance more than smoothness. In order to promote trust, robot designers should prioritize consistent, learnable behaviors.",

      "title": "Synergistic Effect of Valproate and Constraint Induced Movement Therapy on Functional Recovery Following Ischemic Stroke in Rats: Neuroplasticity and Corticosterone Associated Mechanisms",
      "content": "Most rehabilitation paradigms primarily rely on physical stimuli, but biological enhancers may play a complementary role in optimizing adaptive outcomes. The HDACi (Histone deacetylase inhibitor) drug valproate has shown neuroprotective properties following cerebral ischemia, but how it interacts with rehabilitative training is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the synergistic effect of Valproate (VPA) and constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) on functional recovery following stroke. We induced cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. VPA (300 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was administered within 3 hours after reperfusion and continued for 7 days, followed by CIMT for another week (6 hours/day). The study revealed a significant increase in total infarction volume in the stroke rats compared to controls on day 7 post-stroke. The behavioral assessments revealed that combined treatment with VPA and CIMT restored the neurological and motor behavior deficits. VPA treatment reduced plasma corticosterone levels and modulated heart rate variability indices in stroke rats, suggesting involvement of neuroendocrine stress responses in post stroke recovery. The electrophysiological findings reveal improved functional connectivity between the penumbral (left) motor cortex and the uninjured motor cortex following combinational treatment. The present study also examined the effects of chronic CIMT and VPA monotherapies and delayed onset CIMT (one week after stroke) on functional recovery following stroke; however, these approaches showed limited efficacy. Thus, the study concludes that VPA, along with rehabilitative training, may represent a novel strategy to improve stroke induced persistent functional deficits.",

      "title": "Sensory-processing sensitivity as a confounder in the positive relationship between mindful awareness and psychological distress: A theoretical review.",
      "content": "Mindfulness meditation is credited as a positive driver of promoting psychological well-being and reducing stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. However, dispositional mindfulness has been somewhat correlated with psychological distress, as awareness has been positively correlated with psychological symptoms and negative affective states in many studies. This counterintuitive phenomenon has been tentatively explained in a variety of ways, including a wrong interpretation of the items of the mindfulness assessment scales in nonmeditators. The most credited explanation is that increasing attention to present-moment experiences would boost affective reaction to negative experiences and therefore exacerbate related psychological symptoms. This hypothesis is unsatisfactory, as there is much contrasting evidence in this regard. Therefore, we propose a new hypothesis: in dispositional studies, the assessment of the awareness skill of mindfulness would be affected by sensory-processing sensitivity, which could be a confounder in its relationship with psychological distress. Sensory-processing sensitivity refers to a temperamental trait characterized by both awareness of sensorial stimulation and reactivity to experience. Thus, highly sensitive persons usually report increased awareness of subtleties in the environment, ease of overstimulation, and increased affective reaction to stimulation. In support of our hypothesis, we showed in particular how the most widely used scale for assessing mindful awareness could be paired with and interpreted as a measure of sensory-processing sensitivity. We then propose a set of testable hypotheses to drive future research on this topic. If supported by future experimental results, our hypothesis would shed new light on the overall field of dispositional mindfulness studies.

      "content": "The representation of our own body is malleable. Evidence indicates that multisensory stimulation can trigger an illusory sense of ownership over a fake hand, a partner\u2019s face, or a virtual body. Despite our understanding of the processes supporting the construction of bodily self, we know less about the processes that trigger illusory ownership of nonbody attributes (e.g., voice during articulation) and about whether multisensory stimulation can drive a shared inference across distinct attributes. Here, we compared the classic rubber hand illusion with another multisensory illusion that elicits a sense of ownership over a stranger\u2019s voice during talking. We observed that, given congruent multisensory input, the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the fake hand predicted the degree to which one perceived the sense of ownership over the stranger\u2019s voice, after controlling for task demand and suggestibility. Thus, our results provide evidence for a shared inference supporting subjective sense of self across fundamentally different attributes. We suggest that individual reliance on multisensory signals to drive such an inference can be further explored. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Unmuting lucid dreams: Speech decoding and vocalization in real time.",
      "content": "Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to communicate with people in lucid dreams (LDs), during which it is possible to maintain consciousness. Previously, dreamers could hear sounds from reality and respond with some simple signals, but they could not speak back. In this study, facial surface electromyography (EMG) was tested as a proof of concept for unmuting people in LDs. Remmyo, an EMG distinctive constructed language, was used. The software was developed to translate facial EMG impulses into Remmyo sounds and letters, translate words into English, and digitally vocalize the final text in English. Four LD practitioners were trained to pronounce a short phrase or a word in Remmyo and were then asked to achieve the same task in LDs under polysomnographic observation. LDs were verified by preagreed eye movements in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Four volunteers tried to speak in Remmyo in 15 LDs. Due to software failures, mispronunciations, and missing sounds, the decoding efficiency in real time or in recordings ranged from 13% to 81%. The first phrase and word heard from sleeping people were \u201cno war\u201d and \u201cfreedom.\u201d The later was automatically translated and vocalized in English in real time for 11 times. Despite controversial results, the study shows that, with further development, people could possibly talk in LDs and could be heard in reality with the help of EMG sensors. To achieve this goal, a range of possible obstacles is discussed. This technology could provide opportunities for LD studies and their practical applications.

      "content": "Klein et al. (2023) argued that the evolutionary transition from respondent to agent during the Cambrian explosion would be a promising vantage point from which to gain insight into the evolution of organic sentience. They focused on how increased competition for resources\u2014in consequence of the proliferation of new, neurally sophisticated life-forms\u2014made awareness of the external world (in the service of agentic acts) an adaptive priority. The explanatory scope of Klein et al. (2023) was limited to consideration of the conscious apprehension of externally sourced content\u2014that is, content delivered from the sensory registration of objects occupying phenomenal space. But consciousness\u2014at least for humans\u2014takes its objects from internal as well as external sources. In the present article, we extend their analysis to the question of how internally sourced content (i.e., mental states) became the object of conscious apprehension.

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "title": "Cryo-EM structure of alpha-Synuclein Fibrils Harboring the Dementia with Lewy Bodies - Associated E83Q Mutation",
      "content": "Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) into amyloid fibrils underlies the pathology of synucleinopathies. Rare familial mutations can modulate a-Syn aggregation and may give rise to distinct fibril conformations linked to disease heterogeneity. The E83Q mutation, identified in a Dementia with Lewy Body disease (DLB) patient with atypical Lewy body distribution, has been shown to accelerate a-Syn aggregation and enhance neuronal seeding, yet its structural basis remains unclear. Here, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure at 3.4 Angstrom resolution of recombinant full-length human a-Syn fibrils harboring the E83Q mutation. The fibrils adopt a double-protofilament architecture with a conserved Greek-key-like core spanning residues 36-99, stabilized by intra- and inter-filament salt bridges. Despite this conserved fold, the E83Q mutation induces a distinct local rearrangement within the hydrophobic region: substitution of Glu83 with Gln reorients residue 83 inward, abolishing solvent exposure and altering interactions with the N-terminal region. This structural shift brings the hydrophobic region closer to the N-terminus, shielding residues implicated in post-translational modification and ligand binding. Our findings reveal how a single charge-neutralizing mutation reshapes a-Syn fibril architecture, providing a structural framework to understand the enhanced aggregation and pathogenic properties associated with the E83Q variant.",

      "title": "Deep learning to overcome human error and bias in electrode position extraction in tDCS-fMRI studies",
      "content": "Combining transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) with fMRI enables investigation of stimulation effects, while structural MRI verifies electrode positioning, critical for focal montages where minor misplacements reduce target current dose. Currently, no fully automated methods exist for precise electrode extraction from MRI. We developed an Attention U-Net-based deep learning approach to automate electrode detection in focal tDCS-fMRI studies, using structural pointwise-encoding time reduction with radial acquisition (PETRA) MRI scans from a multicenter trial (N = 392 images; 1,568 electrodes, https://www.memoslap.de/en/home/). Performance was compared to manual and semi-automated methods for a 3x1 montage (three cathodes around a central anode). The network achieved robust segmentation (Dice Score = 0.76, Hausdorff distance = 36.76 mm), identifying all electrodes in 95% of cases (323/340). These metrics compared network-segmented electrodes to highly accurate, manually segmented electrodes, which are also called \"ground truth\". Linear mixed-effects models on 52 ground truth images showed deep learning outperformed manual and semi-automated methods, aligning best with ground truth. Fully/semi-automated methods comparison of 290 images showed highest agreement (ICC = 0.990, bias = 1.3 mm), while manual extraction exhibited larger biases (-5.77 to -7.06 mm) and systematic errors. The automated approach overcomes manual limitations by improving precision, eliminating human variability and bias, and enabling scalability for large studies. It sets a new standard for electrode verification in focal tDCS, particularly for studies requiring precise localization. The model is open-source, with future refinements discussed",

      "title": "Fluorescence lifetime-based biosensor for monitoring compartmentalized autophagy dynamics in the intact mammalian brain",
      "content": "Synaptic architecture underlies neuronal computation, with autophagy serving as a key regulator of synaptic plasticity, function and local metabolism. Yet, autophagy dynamics and regulation within intact neuronal circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we developed a pH sensitive fluorescence lifetime-based imaging method which allows to monitor autophagy dynamics at the synaptic level with a second-scale temporal resolution in the living mouse brain. This approach allowed us to uncover compartmentalized autophagic activity across soma, dendrites, and axons of layer 2/3 cortical neurons. Notably, we observe experience-dependent modulation of autophagy dynamics with pronounced mobility of autophagic vesicles in apical distal dendrites compared to basal proximal dendritic branches. We identified cell-type specific basal autophagy levels in excitatory, inhibitory, and astrocytic cells in the mouse cortex. Finally, combining this approach with disease associated genetic perturbation uncovers novel in vivo autophagy related phenotypes. Altogether, this approach highlights the spatial and functional complexity of autophagy in the intact mammalian brain and establishes a framework for investigating its role in synaptic regulation during development, plasticity, and aging.",

      "title": "\"Remote and partial clocks expand the circadian neuronal network, driving widespread molecular rhythmicity in Drosophila\"",
      "content": "Circadian clocks orchestrate daily physiology and behavioral rhythms, yet the extent to which cells lacking canonical clock components exhibit robust temporal regulation remains unclear. Here we addressed this question using a two-step strategy. First, we systematically mapped core clock gene expression at single-cell resolution across the Drosophila brain and body. Second, leveraging these data and performing targeted experiments, we uncovered cells that lack most or all canonical clock components yet display strong mRNA rhythms. We found that lamina wide-field neurons show high-amplitude tim mRNA cycling even in constant darkness conditions (DD) despite minimal expression of other clock genes, suggesting a partial or noncanonical oscillator. In addition, C2 and C3 optic lobe neurons, which do not express core clock components, exhibit hundreds of circadian and daily cycling transcripts. Notably, circadian rhythms in C3 neurons coincide with oscillations of activity-regulated genes (ARGs), whereas C2 neurons cycle independently of ARGs, indicating distinct non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. These findings reveal a spectrum of circadian regulation, from autonomous to remote, input-driven rhythms and expand the circadian landscape to include strategies for generating and distributing temporal information across neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.",
