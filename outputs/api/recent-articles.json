These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

This approach is so powerful that we started wondering whether it might also give us greater statistical power in more typical experiments where the goal is to determine whether an ERP component differs in amplitude across experimental conditions. For example, might we more easily be able to tell if N400 amplitude is different between two different classes of words by using decoding? If so, that might make it possible to detect effects that would otherwise be too small to be significant.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n  \n    \n\n      \n\n      \n        <figure class=\"\n              sqs-block-image-figure\n              intrinsic\n            \">\n          \n        \n        \n\n        \n          \n            \n          \n            \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                \n                <img alt=\"\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5abefa62d274cb16de90e935/08f353c7-f484-4e87-b5d3-a256fe1206e2/N170_ES.png?format=1000w\" width=\"971\" />\n\n            \n          \n        \n          \n        \n\n        \n      \n        </figure>\n      \n\n    \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  <p class=\"\">To address this question, we compared decoding with the conventional ERP analysis approach with using the 6 experimental paradigms in the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.18115/D5JW4R\">ERP CORE</a>. In the conventional ERP analysis, we measured the mean amplitude during the standard measurement window from each participant in the two conditions of the paradigm (e.g., faces versus cars for N170, deviants versus standards for MMN). We quantified the magnitude of the difference between conditions using Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> (the variant of Cohen\u2019s <em>d</em> corresponding to a paired <em>t</em> test). For example, the effect size in the conventional ERP comparison of faces versus cars in the N170 paradigm was approximately 1.7 (see the figure).</p><p class=\"\">We also applied decoding to each paradigm. For example, in the N170 paradigm, we trained a support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between ERPs elicited by faces and ERPs elicited by cars. This was done separately for each subject, and we converted the decoding accuracy into Cohen\u2019s <em>dz</em> so that it could be compared with the <em>dz</em> from the conventional ERP analysis. As you can see from the bar labeled SVM in the figure above, the effect size for the SVM-based decoding analysis was almost twice as large as the effect size for the conventional ERP analysis.

      "content": "Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and the current standard of care, therapeutic hypothermia, provides only partial neuroprotection. This study investigates the potential of low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-TMS) as a novel non-pharmacological adjunct therapy by targeting a key pathological mechanism of HIE: a persistent, pathological increase in glutamatergic synaptic transmission, or hypoxic long-term potentiation (hLTP). Using a neonatal mouse model of hypoxia-ischemia, we administered a single session of LF-TMS shortly after the hypoxic event. We then evaluated its effects on synaptic function via slice electrophysiology and on brain injury volume using serial MRI. Our results show that hypoxia-ischemia induced a significant and lasting synaptic potentiation in the brain's penumbral region. A single LF-TMS treatment successfully reduced this elevated glutamatergic response to control levels, suggesting a therapeutic mechanism similar to long-term depression (LTD) by regulating AMPA receptor redistribution. Furthermore, LF-TMS provided significant neuroprotection, as demonstrated by a reduction in the volume of the ischemic core and penumbra 48 hours after the injury. LF-TMS did not alter excitability in sham-treated mice, confirming its safety as a targeted intervention for pathological conditions without affecting normal brain function. This study provides strong evidence that LF-TMS is a promising neuroprotective strategy that acutely and subacutely mitigates brain injury in a neonatal hypoxia-ischemia model.",

      "title": "Explaining attractive and repulsive biases in the subjective visual vertical",
      "content": "Perception of gravity can be assessed by measuring the subjective visual vertical (SVV), the visually indicated spatial direction that appears earth-vertical to an observer. When the SVV is measured in darkness while the observer is roll-tilted, it shows substantial biases. At tilts larger than 45{degrees}, the bias is attractive, that is, the visual indicator appears vertical when rotated toward the observer. At smaller tilts, however, a repulsive bias is observed. The attractive bias has been explained within the Bayesian framework as the effect of a prior for upright posture. The repulsive bias has so far been considered anti-Bayesian, suboptimal, or as the result of uncompensated ocular counterroll. Here we show that both biases can be explained within a purely Bayesian model. More specifically, the repulsive bias at small roll-tilts is a consequence of the known tilt-dependent variability of the SVV, which is hypothesized to reflect different levels of sensory noise of the otolith organs. We thus provide a solution to a century-old question of why there is a repulsive bias in vertical perception.",

      "content": "Objective: Treatment selection for infantile epileptic spasms syndrome (IESS) is complex and multifaceted, and currently no EEG biomarkers can guide this decision by predicting treatment response. We tested the predictive value of phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), as IESS patients are known to have elevated PAC. Methods: We analyzed retrospective EEG recordings from 40 IESS patients, before and after treatment, and 20 healthy controls. Patients were classified as responders (n=25) or non-responders (n=15) based on short-term treatment outcomes. We measured PAC in each EEG using modulation index (MI) and mean vector length (MVL) and analyzed the relationship between pre- and post-treatment values and the ability of pre-treatment values to predict response. Results: MI and MVL values decreased with treatment in almost all subjects. However, non-responders had significantly higher pre-treatment MI than responders (P<0.05), suggesting utility for predicting treatment response. Logistic regression modeling suggested that a 0.5 unit decrease in log(MI), which is approximately one IQR of the pre-treatment log(MI) values, results in a 6-fold increase in odds of positive treatment response. Significance: MI reflects short-term treatment response and is a candidate predictive EEG biomarker for IESS. MI may offer individualized insights for treatment selection and management strategies for IESS.",

      "title": "Local translation of circular RNAs is required for synaptic activity and memory",
      "content": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enriched in synapses and implicated in cognitive processes, and recent studies have shown that circRNAs can encode micropeptides, which suggests that there may be novel synaptic proteoforms in the brain that await discovery. Here we report widespread learning-induced local circRNA translation in the prefrontal cortex of male C57BL/6 mice. More than 1500 synapse-enriched circRNAs contain active IRES elements, with 842 interacting with the ribosome and 241 exhibiting direct evidence of activity-induced translation. We discovered a synapse-enriched micropeptide (P1) that is derived from a single exon circRNA, the mRNA host of which encodes an enzyme associated with protein repair. Although P1 is only a third of the size of the full-length protein, it is locally expressed, enzymatically active, and interacts with plasticity-related proteins, including CaMKII. In addition to direct effects on synaptic activity, targeted P1 knockdown impairs whereas its overexpression enhances fear extinction memory. These findings shed new light on the \"dark\" proteome in the brain and reveal local circRNA translation as a novel mechanism of plasticity and memory.",

      "content": "To extend the assessment of listening effort beyond a sound booth, we validated mobile eye-tracking glasses (Pupil Labs Neon) by comparing them to a stationary system (Eyelink DUO) in a controlled environment. We recorded eye movements, pupil size, and head movements from 26 young adults during a speech-in-noise task. When listening conditions became challenging, we observed reduced gaze dispersion and increased pupil sizes of similar magnitude from both devices, in addition to reduced head movements recorded solely by the mobile device. These findings suggest that mobile eye-trackers reliably capture listening effort, paving the path towards assessments in daily settings.",

      "title": "Pre-stimulus Brain States Predict and Control Variability in Stimulation Responses",
      "content": "Does the ongoing brain state determine how it responds to localized electrical stimulation? This fundamental question has major implications for neuroscience and medicine, as stimulation outcomes remain highly variable even when identical parameters (\"how\") and target sites (\"where\") are used. Such unpredictability undermines reproducibility, limits clinical reliability, and forces current protocols to rely on empirical trial-and-error rather than principled, evidence-based strategies. Mounting evidence suggests that the brain's state prior to stimulation--a crucial \"when\" factor--shapes responses, yet the most reliable predictive markers remain unknown. Here, we systematically characterize the links between pre-stimulus (spontaneous) activity and post-stimulus (evoked) responses using simultaneous high-density EEG and stereotactic EEG from 36 epilepsy patients across 379 sessions (21,800 stimulations). We show that large-scale neural dynamics robustly predict stimulation outcomes, with a subset of measures--particularly network synchronization, functional connectivity, and spatiotemporal signal diversity--consistently forecasting responses across sessions. Whole-brain activity enhanced prediction compared to local assessments, and predictability varied across networks, being strongest in sensorimotor and visual regions. These findings establish a quantitative framework for state-dependent brain stimulation: by timing interventions to optimal pre-stimulus states, variability can be reduced and reproducibility enhanced. Our results directly address the fundamental question of where and when to stimulate, providing a pathway toward evidence-based protocols with improved therapeutic precision.",

      "title": "Psychedelics Relax Priors and Reshape Orbitofrontal Dynamics",
      "content": "Psychedelics such as psilocybin and ketamine are gaining attention as rapid-acting treatments for psychiatric disorders, yet the mechanisms by which they alter cognition remain unclear. A key hypothesis from the REBUS model proposes that psychedelics relax high-level priors, allowing bottom-up sensory information to exert greater influence over perception and behavior. Here, we test this model in mice performing a free-response perceptual decision-making task that disambiguates prior-driven and sensory-driven decision strategies. Acute administration of psilocybin or ketamine significantly slowed decision times and improved accuracy. Behavioral modeling that combined drift diffusion and GLM-HMM frameworks revealed that these changes were mediated by increased decision thresholds and a marked shift into sensory-engaged cognitive states. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping identified a distributed decision-making network, with psychedelics selectively modulating cortical and subcortical nodes. Calcium imaging in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key region for integrating priors and sensory inputs, revealed preserved decision-related selectivity under psychedelics, while exhibiting reduced neuronal correlations, i.e. population-level signatures of weakened top-down influence and relaxed priors. Together, these results provide circuit-level support for the REBUS model, showing that psychedelics reconfigure brain-wide and local dynamics to promote more deliberate, flexible, and sensory-driven decision policies.",

      "content": "Temporal processing, including duration, is essential for survival and communication across species. Intellectual disability (ID), which has diverse causes, including Cereblon (CRBN), impairs duration discrimination. CRBN-related ID, link to abnormal cognitive behaviors, may disrupt both perception and behavior during duration discrimination. However, cross-species behavioral strategies, their variation with ID, and associated behavioral indices remain unclear. Here, humans and wild-type (WT) mice with typical intelligence, and CRBN knockout (KO) mice with ID, performed an auditory duration discrimination task with Long (10 s) and Short (2 s) cues. All groups distinguished stimulus durations, but latency-based strategies diverged. KO mice showed impulsivity and divergent responses at both individual and group levels, whereas WT mice and humans consistently delayed their responses by ~2 s to the Short cue length, reflecting inhibition and convergent responses. In typical intelligence models, latencies for both stimuli clustered between 2--5 s, while in ID model depended on stimulus duration. Duration perception is a conserved cross-species capacity, while task-specific cognitive strategies are intrinsically preserved though variation emerges with ID. We suggest that latency indices dissociated inhibition from impulsivity, and convergence from divergence. We further suggest that CRBN-related ID preserves perceptual understanding but disrupts the shared behavioral language of typical intelligence.",
