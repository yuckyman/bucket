      "title": "Neurocognition, cerebellar functions and psychiatric features in spinocerebellar ataxia type 34: a case series",
      "content": "ObjectiveThis study primarily aimed to comprehensively characterize the neurological, neuroradiological and neurocognitive profiles, as well psychiatric features of individuals with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 34 (SCA34) associated with pathogenic variants in the ELOVL4 gene. Secondarily, we investigated the relationship between neurocognitive functions and cerebellar morphology in individuals with SCA34 by correlating structural changes to cognitive performance. Given involvement of the cerebellum in SCA34, our findings will contribute to a broader understanding of the role of the cerebellum in cognition.MethodsFour individuals (52 f, 72\u2009m, 76\u2009m, 76 f) underwent DNA testing using Next-Generation Sequencing and detailed assessment of neurocognitive functions. The test battery evaluated all six cognitive domains: verbal functions, executive functions, attention and processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial perception and abilities, and social cognition. In addition, cerebellar and motor functions were evaluated using Finger Tapping, Prism Adaptation, and the Motor Speed subtest of the Delis-Kaplan executive function system (D-KEFS). Test results were compared with each individual\u2019s estimated premorbid cognitive level, determined from their highest educational attainment or occupational status prior to disease onset. Psychiatric symptoms related to anxiety, depression, and sleep were reported using clinical scales. The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) was used to assess ataxia severity. Two individuals and one matched control underwent high-resolution 7T MRI to characterize cerebellar morphology.ResultsNeurocognitive assessments identified cognitive and motor dysfunction across all individuals, including distinct neurocognitive impairments consistent with cerebellar cognitive-affective syndrome (CCAS), along with additional deficits in learning, visual and verbal episodic memory, emotion recognition\u2014a component of social cognition. Anxiety and sleep disturbance, but not depression, were observed in both female participants. High-resolution 7\u2009T MRI revealed structural cerebellar alterations, with moderate to severe bilateral cerebellar atrophy, including the vermis and multiple lobules (Crus II, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IX), as well as atrophy of the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, accompanied by mild pontine atrophy. Genetic analyses confirmed the involvement of ELOVL4-related disruptions in long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis, offering insight into the molecular underpinnings of cerebellar degeneration in SCA34.ConclusionIndividuals with SCA34 show cerebellar degeneration accompanied by cognitive, motor, and social-affective impairments consistent with CCAS. Atrophy of the vermis, multiple lobules, and cerebellar peduncles align with these deficits, highlighting the cerebellum\u2019s key role in cognition. ELOVL4-related disruptions in fatty acid biosynthesis provides insight into the molecular basis of SCA34. Together, these findings advance our understanding of how cerebellar pathology contributes to complex neurocognitive and psychiatric symptoms in genetic ataxias.",

      "title": "Retraining dorsal visual pathways improves cognitive skills and executive control networks following mild traumatic brain injury",
      "content": "Background and objectivesMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) frequently results in persistent cognitive deficits with limited evidence-based rehabilitation options. Visual timing deficits, potentially linked to dorsal visual pathway dysfunction, represent a promising therapeutic target. This study examined whether a novel intervention targeting dorsal visual pathways (PATH) demonstrates superior efficacy compared to conventional cognitive therapies targeting ventral pathway deficits or working memory impairments.MethodsTwenty-four participants (aged 23\u201362 years) with mTBI were randomized to receive one of three interventions over 12 weeks: (1) PATH training targeting dorsal visual pathway function, (2) Orientation Discrimination (OD) targeting ventral pathway pattern discrimination, both of these 20-min interventions followed by 10-min of digit memory exercises, or (3) ReCollect, working memory training. Each intervention consisted of 36 sessions (30 min each, three times weekly). Primary outcome was visual working memory (VWM) performance; secondary outcomes included processing speed, reading speed, auditory working memory, selective attention, and cognitive flexibility assessed via standardized neuropsychological measures. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during resting state and an N-Back task provided neurophysiological validation.ResultsPATH training yielded significantly greater VWM improvements (49%) compared to ReCollect (13%) and OD (8%) interventions. Repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed superior efficacy of dorsal pathway training (significant at p = 0.011). Similar gains for PATH training were also found for processing speed, reading speed, and cognitive flexibility, especially when compared to the OD group, revealing importance of strengthening the dorsal stream before digit memory exercises. MEG analysis revealed PATH-specific activation in not only bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, superior occipital gyri, but also the left anterior temporal lobe and hippocampus, primary motor cortex, and the cerebellum, as well as lower gamma-band noise, suggesting enhanced neural timing, attention, working memory, memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms beyond the targeted dorsal pathways.ConclusionDorsal visual pathway retraining followed by targeted working memory exercises demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy for cognitive rehabilitation following mTBI compared to conventional approaches. The intervention promotes beneficial neuroplasticity extending to memory-related brain regions, supporting its potential as a targeted, mechanistically-informed therapy for post-concussive cognitive deficits.",

      "content": "Quantum-like modeling (QLM)\u2014quantum theory applications outside of physics\u2014are intensively developed with applications in biology, cognition, psychology, and decision-making. For cognition, QLM should be distinguished from quantum reductionist models in the spirit of Hameroff and Penrose, as well as Umezawa and Vitiello. QLM is not only concerned with just quantum physical processes in the brain but also with QL information processing by macroscopic neuronal structures. Although QLM of cognition and decision-making has seen some success, it suffers from a knowledge gap that exists between oscillatory neuronal network functioning in the brain and QL behavioral patterns. Recently, steps toward closing this gap have been taken using the generalized probability theory and prequantum classical statistical field theory (PCSFT)\u2014a random field model beyond the complex Hilbert space formalism. PCSFT is used to move from the classical \u201coscillatory cognition\u201d of the neuronal networks to QLM for decision-making. In this study, we addressed the most difficult problem within this construction: QLM for entanglement generation by classical networks, that is, \u201cmental entanglement.\u201d We started with the observational approach to entanglement based on operator algebras describing \u201clocal observables\u201d and bringing into being the tensor product structure in the space of QL states. Moreover, we applied the standard states entanglement approach: entanglement generation by spatially separated networks in the brain. Finally, we discussed possible future experiments on \u201cmental entanglement\u201d detection using the EEG/MEG technique.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.07117v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This chapter explores human creativity in AI-assisted learning environments through the lens of student agency. We begin by examining four theoretical perspectives on agency, including instrumental, effortful, dynamically emergent, and authorial agency, and analyze how each frames the relationship between agency and creativity. Under each theoretical perspective, we discuss how the integration of generative AI (GenAI) tools reshapes these dynamics by altering students' roles in cognitive, social, and creative processes. In the second part, we introduce a theoretical framework for AI agentic engagement, contextualizing agency within specific cognitive, relational, and ethical dynamics introduced by GenAI tools. This framework is linked to the concept of Mini-c creativity, emphasizing personal relevance and self-directed learning. Together, these perspectives support a shift from viewing creativity as product-oriented to understanding it as a process of agentive participation and meaning-making. We conclude with two directions for future research focused on the creative process and performance in AI-assisted learning.",

One desirable personality trait in cooperative partners, known to improve task performance, is agreeableness. To explore the impact of large language models on personality modeling for robots, as well as the effect of agreeable and non-agreeable personalities in cooperative tasks, we conduct a two-part study. This includes an online pre-study for personality validation and a lab-based main study to evaluate the effects on likability, motivation, and task performance. The results demonstrate that the robot's agreeableness significantly enhances its likability. No significant difference in intrinsic motivation was observed between the two personality types. However, the findings suggest that a robot exhibiting agreeableness and openness to new experiences can enhance task performance. This study highlights the advantages of employing large language models for customized modeling of robot personalities and provides evidence that a carefully chosen agreeable robot personality can positively influence human perceptions and lead to greater success in cooperative scenarios.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.06834v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) make high-quality instruction accessible. However, the lack of face-to-face interaction makes it difficult for instructors to obtain feedback on learners' performance and provide more effective instructional guidance. Traditional analytical approaches, such as clickstream logs or quiz scores, capture only coarse-grained learning outcomes and offer limited insight into learners' moment-to-moment cognitive states. In this study, we propose COIVis, an eye tracking-based visual analytics system that supports concept-level exploration of learning processes in MOOC videos. COIVis first extracts course concepts from multimodal video content and aligns them with the temporal structure and screen space of the lecture, defining Concepts of Interest (COIs), which anchor abstract concepts to specific spatiotemporal regions. Learners' gaze trajectories are transformed into COI sequences, and five interpretable learner-state features -- Attention, Cognitive Load, Interest, Preference, and Synchronicity -- are computed at the COI level based on eye tracking metrics. Building on these representations, COIVis provides a narrative, multi-view visualization enabling instructors to move from cohort-level overviews to individual learning paths, quickly locate problematic concepts, and compare diverse learning strategies. We evaluate COIVis through two case studies and in-depth user-feedback interviews. The results demonstrate that COIVis effectively provides instructors with valuable insights into the consistency and anomalies of learners' learning patterns, thereby supporting timely and personalized interventions for learners and optimizing instructional design.",

      "title": "Exploring Teenagers' Trust in Al Chatbots: An Empirical Study of Chinese Middle-School Students",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.06647v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Chatbots have become increasingly prevalent. A growing body of research focused on the issue of human trust in AI. However, most existing user studies are conducted primarily with adult groups, overlooking teenagers who are also engaging more frequently with AI technologies. Based on previous theories about teenage education and psychology, this study investigates the correlation between teenagers' psychological characteristics and their trust in AI chatbots, examining four key variables: AI literacy, ego identity, social anxiety, and psychological resilience. We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining an online survey with semi-structured interviews. Our findings reveal that psychological resilience is a significant positive predictor of trust in AI, and that age significantly moderates the relationship between social anxiety and trust. The interviews further suggest that teenagers generally report relatively high levels of trust in AI, tend to overestimate their AI literacy, and are influenced by external factors such as social media.",

      "title": "Memory Power Asymmetry in Human-AI Relationships: Preserving Mutual Forgetting in the Digital Age",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.06616v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in personal and professional relationships, a new kind of power imbalance emerges from asymmetric memory capabilities. Human relationships have historically relied on mutual forgetting, the natural tendency for both parties to forget details over time, as a foundation for psychological safety, forgiveness, and identity change. By contrast, AI systems can record, store, and recombine interaction histories at scale, often indefinitely. We introduce Memory Power Asymmetry (MPA): a structural power imbalance that arises when one relationship partner (typically an AI-enabled firm) possesses a substantially superior capacity to record, retain, retrieve, and integrate the shared history of the relationship, and can selectively deploy that history in ways the other partner (the human) cannot. Drawing on research in human memory, power-dependence theory, AI architecture, and consumer vulnerability, we develop a conceptual framework with four dimensions of MPA (persistence, accuracy, accessibility, integration) and four mechanisms by which memory asymmetry is translated into power (strategic memory deployment, narrative control, dependence asymmetry, vulnerability accumulation). We theorize downstream consequences at individual, relational/firm, and societal levels, formulate boundary-conditioned propositions, and articulate six design principles for restoring a healthier balance of memory in human-AI relationships (e.g., forgetting by design, contextual containment, symmetric access to records). Our analysis positions MPA as a distinct construct relative to information asymmetry, privacy, surveillance, and customer relationship management, and argues that protecting mutual forgetting, or at least mutual control over memory, should become a central design and policy goal in the AI age.",

      "title": "Beyond Satisfaction: From Placebic to Actionable Explanations For Enhanced Understandability",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.06591v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Explainable AI (XAI) presents useful tools to facilitate transparency and trustworthiness in machine learning systems. However, current evaluations of system explainability often rely heavily on subjective user surveys, which may not adequately capture the effectiveness of explanations. This paper critiques the overreliance on user satisfaction metrics and explores whether these can differentiate between meaningful (actionable) and vacuous (placebic) explanations. In experiments involving optimal Social Security filing age selection tasks, participants used one of three protocols: no explanations, placebic explanations, and actionable explanations. Participants who received actionable explanations significantly outperformed the other groups in objective measures of their mental model, but users rated placebic and actionable explanations as equally satisfying. This suggests that subjective surveys alone fail to capture whether explanations truly support users in building useful domain understanding. We propose that future evaluations of agent explanation capabilities should integrate objective task performance metrics alongside subjective assessments to more accurately measure explanation quality.

      "title": "\"Having Confidence in My Confidence Intervals\": How Data Users Engage with Privacy-Protected Wikipedia Data",
      "content": "arXiv:2512.06534v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In response to calls for open data and growing privacy threats, organizations are increasingly adopting privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy (DP) that inject statistical noise when generating published datasets. These techniques are designed to protect privacy of data subjects while enabling useful analyses, but their reception by data users is under-explored. We developed documentation that presents the noise characteristics of two Wikipedia pageview datasets: one using rounding (heuristic privacy) and another using DP (formal privacy). After incorporating expert feedback (n=5), we used these documents to conduct a task-based contextual inquiry (n=15) exploring how data users--largely unfamiliar with these methods--perceive, interact with, and interpret privacy-preserving noise during data analysis.\n  Participants readily used simple uncertainty metrics from the documentation, but struggled when asked to compute confidence intervals across multiple noisy estimates. They were better able to devise simulation-based approaches for computing uncertainty with DP data compared to rounded data. Surprisingly, several participants incorrectly believed DP's stronger utility implied weaker privacy protections. Based on our findings, we offer design recommendations for documentation and tools to better support data users working with privacy-noised data.",

This paper introduces our developed geospatial Application Programming Interface (API) that automates the generation of 3D urban digital model from open data. The API synthesizes data from OpenTopography, OpenStreetMap, and Overture Maps in generating 3D models. The rendered model visualizes and contextualizes power grid infrastructure alongside the built environment and transportation networks. The API provides interactive figures for the 3D models, which are essential for analyzing infrastructure alignment and spatially linking energy demand nodes (buildings) with energy supply (utility grids). Our API leverages standard Web Mercator coordinates (EPSG:3857) and JSON serialization to ensure interoperability within smart city and energy simulation platforms.",

      "content": "arXiv:2512.06408v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Long texts are ubiquitous on social platforms, yet readers often face information overload and struggle to locate key content. Comments provide valuable external perspectives for understanding, questioning, and complementing the text, but their potential is hindered by disorganized and unstructured presentation. Few studies have explored embedding comments directly into reading. As an exploratory step, we propose CommentScope, a system with two core modules: a pipeline that classifies comments into five types and aligns them with relevant sentences, and a presentation module that integrates comments inline or as side notes, supported by visual cues such as colors, charts, and highlights. Technical evaluation shows that the hybrid \"Rule+LLM\" pipeline achieved solid performance in semantic classification (accuracy=0.90) and position alignment (accuracy=0.88). A user study (N=12) further demonstrated that the sentence-end embedding significantly improved comment discovery accuracy and reading fluency while reducing mental demand and perceived effort.",
