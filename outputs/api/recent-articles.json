      "content": "<p>I built this because Cursor, Claude Code and other agentic AI tools kept giving me tests that looked fine but failed when I ran them. Or worse - I'd ask the agent to run them and it would start looping: fix tests, those fail, then it starts \"fixing\" my code so tests pass, or just deletes assertions so they \"pass\".<p>Out of that frustration I built KeelTest - a VS Code extension that generates pytest tests and executes them, got hooked and decided to push this project forward... When tests fail, it tries to figure out why:<p>- Generation error: Attemps to fix it automatically, then tries again<p>- Bug in your source code: flags it and explains what's wrong<p>How it works:<p>- Static analysis to map dependencies, patterns, services to mock.<p>- Generate a plan for each function and what edge cases to cover<p>- Generate those tests<p>- Execute in \"sandbox\"<p>- Self-heal failures or flag source bugs<p>Python + pytest only for now. Alpha stage - not all codebases work reliably. But testing on personal projects and a few production apps at work, it's been consistently decent. Works best on simpler applications, sometimes glitches on monorepos setups.

      "content": "BackgroundSpinal cord atrophy is a key biomarker for tracking disease progression in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and spinal cord injury. Recent MRI advancements have improved atrophy detection, particularly in the cervical region, facilitating longitudinal studies. However, validating atrophy quantification algorithms remains challenging due to limited ground truth data.ObjectiveThis study introduces SynSpine, a workflow for generating synthetic spinal cord MRI data (i.e., digital phantoms) with controlled levels of artificial atrophy. These phantoms support the development and preliminary validation of spinal cord imaging pipelines designed to measure degeneration over time.MethodsThe workflow consists of two phases: (1) generating synthetic MR images by isolating, extracting and scaling the spinal cord, simulating atrophy on the PAM50 template; (2) performing non-rigid registration to align the synthetic images with the subject\u2019s native space, ensuring accurate anatomical correspondence. A proof-of-concept application utilizing the Active Surface and Reg methods implemented in Jim demonstrated its effectiveness in detecting atrophy across various levels of simulated atrophy and noise.ResultsSynSpine successfully generates synthetic spinal cord images with varying atrophy levels. Non-rigid registration did not significantly affect atrophy measurements. Atrophy estimation errors, estimated using Active Surface and Reg methods, varied with both simulated atrophy magnitude and noise level, exhibiting region-dependent differences. Increased noise led to higher measurement errors.ConclusionThis work presents a novel and modular framework for simulating spinal cord atrophy data using digital phantoms, offering a controlled setting for testing spinal cord analysis pipelines. As the simulated atrophy may over-simplify in vivo conditions, future research will focus on enhancing the realism of the synthetic dataset by simulating additional pathologies, thus improving its application for evaluating spinal cord atrophy in clinical and research contexts.",
