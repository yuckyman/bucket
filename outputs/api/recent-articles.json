      "title": "Spectral envelopes of rhythmic facial movements predict intention and motor cortical representations",
      "content": "Animals, including humans, use coordinated facial movements to sample the environment, ingest nutrients, and communicate. To study these behaviors and the neural signals that underlie them, we introduce face-rhythm, a tool for quantitatively tracking, extracting, and interpreting facial movements. The approach utilizes markerless point tracking, spectral analysis, and tensor component analysis to extract demixed components of behavior from videos of facial movements. Face-rhythm is fully unsupervised and allows for the discovery of uninstructed behaviors; when applied to videos of facial behavior, face-rhythm identifies interpretable behaviors such as whisking, sniffing, and snout movements. Analysis of videos of mice in various behavioral conditions, including a classical conditioning protocol, a brain-machine interface (BMI) task, and natural behaviors outside of a task structure, revealed robust signatures of uninstructed facial movements in all regimes. The expression of these facial movements predicted internal belief states during classical conditioning and was correlated with instructed neural activity when the BMI was activated. Furthermore, facial behaviors identified by face-rhythm were highly represented in face-associated areas of primary motor cortex (M1). We found that M1 neural activity encodes a mixed representation of both the phase of facial movements as well as the phase-invariant spectral envelope of movement patterns, with higher-frequency facial movements being more likely to be represented as phase-invariant. Our results demonstrate that face-rhythm provides a novel and flexible approach for decomposing continuous face movements into natural behavioral motifs that are closely linked to neural activity patterns.",

      "content": "Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is highly comorbid with autism spectrum disorders and can cause abnormal social behaviors. The CA2 subregion of the hippocampus is essential for social memory processing and social recognition. A social interaction induces changes in CA2 neuronal firing; however, it is unknown whether these changes are impaired in FXS models. Here, we examined CA2 activity in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome (Fmr1 knockout rats). In Fmr1 knockout rats, we observed impaired CA2 cell responses to social stimuli, despite similar social behaviors. Further, in CA2 of Fmr1 knockout rats, we found reduced expression of oxytocin receptors and impaired whole cell responses to oxytocin. Together, these results raise the possibility that abnormal CA2 activity contributes to impaired social behavior in FXS and may suggest novel treatment targets for FXS patients.",

      "title": "Fractionation of sex differences in human cortical anatomy",
      "content": "Humans show reproducible sex differences in regional cortical volume (CV), but it remains unclear how these arise from underlying sex-biases in the two biologically dissociable determinants of CV: surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT). Moreover, limited access to experimental methods in humans has hindered direct studies of the causal drivers of regional sex differences in the human cortex, although rodent models have argued for both chromosomal and gonadal contributions to sex-biased mammalian cortical development. Here, we first use structural neuroimaging data in two independent human cohorts (combined N=1,754; 967 females) to quantify and spatially resolve the differential contributions of SA and CT to observed sex differences in CV. These dissociable facets of sex-biased cortical organization are highly reproducible and align with distinct functional networks and histo-molecular signatures. We then leverage complementary neuroimaging data in clinical case-control cohorts (combined N=313) featuring variations in X and Y chromosome dosage (sex chromosome aneuploidies) and testicular hormone production (isolated GnRH deficiency) to establish that regions of sex-biased CV, SA and CT in humans are enriched for congruent anatomical effects of X-chromosome dosage (e.g., primary sensory and insular cortices) and gonadal hormones (e.g. dorsomedial frontal and temporo-parietal-occipital regions). Taken together, these findings substantially advance both the breadth and granularity of our understanding regarding sex-biased cortical organization in humans - disambiguating sex effects on regional CV, SA and CT and nominating their potential genetic and endocrine causes.",

      "title": "Spatiomolecular mapping reveals anatomical organization of heterogeneous cell types in the human nucleus accumbens",
      "content": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key component of the mesolimbic dopamine system that critically regulates many behaviors related to reward and motivation. The NAc is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. Rodent studies have identified spatial organization of heterogeneous medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes across the NAc core and shell, but the extent to which this cellular diversity and spatial organization is conserved in the human brain remains unclear. Here, we generated a spatiomolecular atlas of NAc cell types and spatial domains by integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem NAc tissue from 10 neurotypical adult donors. We identified 20 transcriptionally unique cell populations and 8 spatial domains, including specialized D1 islands composed of distinct dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1) MSN subtypes, which were enriched for OPRM1. In contrast to a discrete core vs. shell division, we observed continuous spatial gradients of gene expression across MSN domains, suggesting a more complex organization of DRD1 and DRD2 MSNs. Cross-species comparisons demonstrated conservation of MSN subtypes and spatial features between human, rodent, and nonhuman primate NAc. Genetic enrichment analysis with stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression revealed specific spatial domains associated with risk for psychiatric and addiction-related traits. To investigate this further, we spatially mapped ligand-receptor interactions involving neuropsychiatric risk genes. Finally, we leveraged existing rodent NAc data to identify drug-responsive transcriptional programs and predict their spatial distribution in the human NAc. Collectively, we provide a spatiomolecular framework for understanding the human NAc and its relevance to neuropsychiatric disease.",

      "title": "Interneuron theta phase locking controls seizure susceptibility",
      "content": "The timing of neuronal activity is highly precise and often organized by brain-wide oscillations. Many neurons modulate their firing rates at specific phases of theta (known as theta phase locking), creating discrete windows for information processing. Disrupted theta phase locking has been found across several neurological and psychiatric disorders (e.g., epilepsy), but gaps in technology have prevented its causal influence from being tested. Here, we developed PhaSER, a closed-loop optogenetic system designed to control the phase locking of specific interneurons, and demonstrate a causal role for inhibitory phase locking in seizure susceptibility. We first found that parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) show distinct theta phase locking profiles and are differentially impacted in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. In healthy mice, PV+ interneurons have extremely consistent phase-locked firing near the trough of CA1 theta, aligned with excitatory inputs to DG. However, in epileptic mice, PV+ interneuron activity is dispersed across the theta cycle, suggesting that altered inhibitory phase locking could be a causal mediator of seizure susceptibility in epilepsy. To test this hypothesis, we applied PhaSER to directly control the phase locking of DG interneurons during an acute test of seizure susceptibility. In epileptic mice, re-aligning DG PV+ interneuron theta phase locking reduced seizure susceptibility, while in healthy mice, disrupting normal phase locking of PV+ interneurons increased seizure susceptibility. Together, this provides the first causal evidence that inhibitory theta phase locking can directly control network function by shifting seizure susceptibility in the healthy and epileptic brain.",

      "title": "Pth4 neurons define a novel hypothalamic circuit that promotes sleep via brainstem monoaminergic neurons",
      "content": "Classical studies identified a critical role for the hypothalamus in regulating sleep and wake states, but few such hypothalamic neuronal populations have been identified. Here we describe a sleep-promoting population of hypothalamic neurons that expresses the neuropeptides QRFP and parathyroid hormone 4 (Pth4) in zebrafish. Optogenetic stimulation of these neurons results in a large increase in sleep that requires pth4 but not qrfp. Noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons and serotonergic raphe neurons (RN) in the hindbrain express distinct pth receptors, and genetic epistasis and cell ablation experiments revealed that Pth4 neuron-induced sleep is suppressed in mutants that lack noradrenaline in the LC or lack the serotonergic RN. Pth4 neuron-induced sleep is also suppressed in serine/threonine kinase 32a (stk32a) mutants, possibly via stk32a-expressing neurons in the prethalamus that express pth receptors. These results identify QRFP/Pth4 neurons as a novel hypothalamic sleep-promoting population and support a model in which distinct sleep- and wake-promoting hypothalamic populations act via monoaminergic neurons in the hindbrain to control vigilance state.",

      "title": "Interplay of synaptic and backpropagating signals in neurogliaform dendrites",
      "content": "Dendrites in diverse neuronal cell types, including interneurons, are active structures that enhance neuronal computational capabilities. Neurogliaform interneurons exhibit robust synaptic plasticity and supralinear summation of clustered dendritic inputs. However, the principles governing supralinear synaptic integration, its interaction with backpropagating somatic signals, and the interplay of the two in the context of synaptic plasticity, remain incompletely understood. We developed a biophysically realistic, multi-compartmental model of a murine hippocampal neurogliaform interneuron, recapitulating key experimental results on dendritic integration. We simulated diverse synaptic input configurations and action potential backpropagation, generating testable predictions validated through ex vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology and two-photon imaging. We further examined how dendritic supralinear integration interacts with backpropagating action potentials to influence synaptic plasticity. Our results show that while both clustered and dispersed synaptic inputs elicit supralinear responses in neurogliaform interneurons, clustered inputs induce more pronounced local depolarisations and calcium transients. Somatic action potentials backpropagate across the dendritic arbour but are attenuated at branch points. Coincident synaptic input and backpropagating action potentials enhance EPSP amplitude and increase calcium influx along the dendrite, enabling voltage and calcium signal propagation and thereby likely contributing to synaptic plasticity.",

      "content": "Extended cessation (EC), an advanced meditative state in which consciousness is volitionally suspended and later reset with immense mental clarity, equanimity, and peace, offers an endogenous model for investigating the mechanisms of consciousness. Using ultra-high-resolution 7T fMRI with dense within-subject sampling (N=3), we quantified whole-brain activity, functional and effective connectivity, cortical gradients, and eigenmodes, and related them to chemoarchitecture and cognitive maps. EC is marked by increased activity in unimodal regions, down-regulation in transmodal regions, subcortex, and brainstem, an expansion of the principal gradient, and decrease in low-order global eigenmodes. Cognitive decoding linked EC to heightened perceptual clarity and attention, least with mental suffering, and co-varied with histaminergic H receptors topology. These findings challenge predictions of Global Neuronal Workspace and Integrated Information Theory, while supporting the Active Inference Framework. More broadly, EC demonstrates that consciousness can cease without global suppression, suggesting a potential 'reset' mechanism that fosters equanimity and the potential for flourishing.

      "title": "Generation of synthetic TSPO PET maps from structural MRI images",
      "content": "IntroductionNeuroinflammation, a pathophysiological process involved in numerous disorders, is typically imaged using [11C]PBR28 (or TSPO) PET. However, this technique is limited by high costs and ionizing radiation, restricting its widespread clinical use. MRI, a more accessible alternative, is commonly used for structural or functional imaging, but when used using traditional approaches has limited sensitivity to specific molecular processes. This study aims to develop a deep learning model to generate TSPO PET images from structural MRI data collected in human subjects.MethodsA total of 204 scans, from participants with knee osteoarthritis (n\u202f=\u202f15 scanned once, 15 scanned twice, 14 scanned three times), back pain (n\u202f=\u202f40 scanned twice, 3 scanned three times), and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, scanned once), underwent simultaneous 3\u202fT MRI and [11C]PBR28 TSPO PET scans. A 3D U-Net model was trained on 80% of these PET-MRI pairs and validated using 5-fold cross-validation. The model\u2019s accuracy in reconstructed PET from MRI only was assessed using various intensity and noise metrics.ResultsThe model achieved a low voxel-wise mean squared error (0.0033\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0010) across all folds and a median contrast-to-noise ratio of 0.0640\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2500 when comparing true to reconstructed PET images. The synthesized PET images accurately replicated the spatial patterns observed in the original PET data. Additionally, the reconstruction accuracy was maintained even after spatial normalization.DiscussionThis study demonstrates that deep learning can accurately synthesize TSPO PET images from conventional, T1-weighted MRI. This approach could enable low-cost, noninvasive neuroinflammation imaging, expanding the clinical applicability of this imaging method.",

      "title": "Predicting attachment style from EEG data on the Flanker task",
      "content": "Bowlby's attachment theory describes the differences that people exhibit in the way they form emotional bonds with others. The dimensional measure of attachment describes it by the magnitude of anxiety and an avoidance dimension, which are currently measured using a self-report questionnaire. Recent advances in neurophysiological methods have started exploring the neural underpinnings of attachment styles. Nonetheless, a conspicuous gap remains: the underexplored realm of predictive models for predicting attachment styles based on objective physiological data. With that in mind, we have constructed a model for inferring individual attachment profiles, based solely on their brain signals recorded using an electroencephalogram (EEG). For that aim, we recorded EEG data of 27 participants engaged in the Flanker task and receiving either positive or negative feedback following each trial. We then utilized the recently developed ROCKET algorithm (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) to automatically extract 20,000 time-series features from the EEG data. Next, we applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and reduced the number of features to 87 individual components that were used to construct regression models predicting participants' anxiety and avoidance scores, as measured by the ECR-R questionnaire. Our results show, for the first time, that individual attachment profiles can be inferred from EEG data, allowing post hoc categorization into the four canonical attachment styles. This offers two key contributions: first, it provides an objective alternative to traditional self-report questionnaires, helping reduce subjectivity bias in attachment assessment. Second, it highlights the value of using automatically generated features over the limited set of hand-crafted features typically found in the literature.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality in all age groups. The functional disability left by TBI, is significant for the patient, family and society. Treatment and early rehabilitation are crucial to the overall level of recovery.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of extended early rehabilitation of patients with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury on the outcome of treatment.MaterialA prospective experimental study comprised 124 patients with moderate and severe TBI, randomly divided into two groups. The patients of the experimental group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 45 min, and the patients of the control group had kinesitherapy seven days a week, twice a day for 30 min. The follow-up parameters were: age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, comorbidities, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission and discharge, early rehabilitation interruptions, presence of tracheostomy, decubitus ulcers, nasogastric tube, diapers and urinary catheter at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and discharge from the hospital, and mortality.Results124 patients were randomly divided into two groups of 62 patients each. The male gender dominated 95 (76.6%). The average age was Me = 62.00 (IQR = 36.0) years. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in gender, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries and comorbidities. GCS on admission; 68 (54.8%) patients had severe, 56 (46.2%) moderate TBI, at discharge: 22 (17.7%) had severe, 11 (8.9%) moderate and 91 (73.4%) mild TBI. At discharge from the ICU, the presence of tracheostomy was (13 vs. 19), (p = 0.218), nasogastric tube (33 vs. 45), (p = 0.026) and decubitus ulcers (0 vs. 4), (p = 0.042) were less in the experimental group. At discharge from the hospital, tracheostomy (6 vs. 16), (p = 0.019), urinary catheter (38 vs. 48), (p = 0.051), diapers (29 vs. 40), (p = 0.047) were less in the experimental group. There were 5 deaths in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in early rehabilitation interruptions between groups (5 vs. 6).ConclusionExtended early TBI rehabilitation is safe, effective and contributes to a positive outcome of treatment.",

      "title": "Gender differences in brain activity underlying acupuncture sensations at LR3: a task-based fMRI study",
      "content": "BackgroundAcupuncture has been practiced in China for centuries, and LR3 (Taichong) is a key acupoint of the liver meridian that has been widely studied. Whether its central mechanism differs by sex remains unclear, because earlier work used single-sex or mixed-sex samples without stratified analysis. To close this gap, we used task-based fMRI together with the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale to compare sex differences in brain activation and thalamic functional connectivity.MethodsWe enrolled 30 men and 25 women in a block-design acupuncture task, the modular task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique was employed to investigate brain activity, and the Massachusetts Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess acupuncture sensations experienced by the participants. Alterations in activated brain regions and functional connectivity were examined separately for males and females. Statistical analyses were performed to determine potential gender differences in acupuncture sensation.ResultsSignificant statistical differences were observed in the 12 acupuncture sensation scores of the MASS scale (p < 0.001). Acupuncture LR3 activated the left inferior cerebellar gyrus, right superior margin gyrus, and left posterior central gyrus in women, and activated the right superior margin gyrus, left central sulcus, and right paracentral lobule in men. Enhanced functional connectivity was also observed in the bilateral thalamus of women: the bilateral caudate nucleus, right precuneus, right cuneate fissure, and bilateral lingular gyrus were highly active. Furthermore, the right thalami also demonstrated enhanced functional connectivity with the left cuneate fissure, right posterior cingulate gyrua, and left precuneu.ConclusionThe differences in the functional connectivity of the right superior marginal gyrus and thalamus between men and women may account for the differences in acupuncture sensory processing between men and women. In addition, the right superior marginal gyrus may be a specific brain region critical for activation of the LR3 acupoint.",

      "title": "Social and non-social directional cues differentially orient attention by learned habit",
      "content": "IntroductionSince an early age, we are implicitly motivated to use the direction of eye gaze of others to learn about the environment, and we orient our attention in space based on this directional signal. Similarly, we orient our attention based on the direction of arrow signs. In both cases, the mechanisms underlying attentional orienting rely on the activity of brain areas involved in endogenous attention; however, orienting by gaze direction also relies on brain areas involved in exogenous attention.Research questionsTo date, it remains unclear whether the acquisition of attentional habit, which can also guide attention in ways that are not purely endogenous or exogenous, is similar for gaze and arrow or rather differs in some important way. We aimed to assess whether learning implicit regularities implemented with exogenous, arrow, and gaze stimuli guides attention in space.MethodsUsing the Posner paradigm, we conducted a series of behavioral experiments with exogenous, arrow, and gaze cues. Unbeknownst to participants, specific regularities, namely cue predictive validity and probability cueing, were implemented through blocks (baseline, learning, testing).Results and discussionThe findings showed that predictive validity alone is not sufficient to engender habitual attention for all types of cues. However, it becomes effective when combined with probability cueing. Importantly, a learned habit with gaze cues engenders unique effects on attention compared to other cues.ConclusionSocially relevant directional signals, such as gaze, can bias spatial attention more effectively than perceptual or non-social directional stimuli.",

      "content": "IntroductionDyke-Davidoff-Masson syndrome (DDMS) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by unilateral hemiparesis, facial asymmetry, severe epilepsy, and intellectual disability. While congenital DDMS is predominantly attributed to anterior circulation anomalies [e.g., internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) hypoplasia], posterior circulation involvement remains unreported. Here, we present the first documented case of congenital DDMS resulting from a rare combination of hypoplastic left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and ipsilateral fetal-type posterior communicating artery (FTP).Case presentationA 19-year-old male exhibited atypical DDMS manifestations: absence seizures, preserved motor function, and occipitotemporal cognitive deficits (MoCA: 20/30). Neuroimaging revealed classic DDMS features. Angiography confirmed left PCA hypoplasia with FTP persistence, while CT perfusion demonstrated chronic left PCA hypoperfusion. Lamotrigine (100\u202fmg/day) and regular cognition rehabilitative training resulted in good symptom control.ConclusionThis case identifies PCA hypoplasia with FTP as a novel DDMS etiology, challenging the MCA/ICA-centric paradigm. The \u201cposterior phenotype\u201d (absence seizures, preserved motor function, occipitotemporal cognitive deficits) expands DDMS heterogeneity. Multimodal imaging (angiography/perfusion) is diagnostic gold-standard, while personalized therapy optimizes outcomes.",

      "content": "Myoelectric control systems translate electromyographic signals (EMG) from muscles into movement intentions, allowing control over various interfaces, such as prosthetics, wearable devices, and robotics. However, a major challenge lies in enhancing the system's ability to generalize, personalize, and adapt to the high variability of EMG signals. Artificial intelligence, particularly neural networks, has shown promising decoding performance when applied to large datasets. However, highly parameterized deep neural networks usually require extensive user-specific data with ground truth labels to learn individual unique EMG patterns. However, the characteristics of the EMG signal can change significantly over time, even for the same user, leading to performance degradation during extended use. In this work, we propose an innovative three-stage neural network training scheme designed to progressively develop an adaptive workflow, improving and maintaining the network performance on 28 subjects over 2 days. Experiments demonstrate the importance and necessity of each stage in the proposed framework.",

      "title": "Integrated neural network framework for multi-object detection and recognition using UAV imagery",
      "content": "IntroductionAccurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning, autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep learning\u2013driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV platforms.MethodThe framework suggests using today\u2019s best neural networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings. YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars. CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used in real life.ResultsOur proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets, AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a detection accuracy of 97.8%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5%, and a classification accuracy of 98.4%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset, it reached 96.9% detection accuracy, 94.4% tracking accuracy, and 97.7% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous benchmarks, demonstrating the system\u2019s robust performance across diverse aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11 for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and scale variations.DiscussionThe outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks. Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying sizes.",

      "content": "In deep-sea areas, the hoisting operation of offshore wind turbines is seriously affected by waves, and the secondary impact is prone to occur between the turbine and the pile foundation. To address this issue, this study proposes an integrated wave compensation system for offshore wind turbines based on a neuromorphic vision (NeuroVI) camera. The system employs a NeuroVI camera to achieve non-contact, high-precision, and low-latency displacement detection of hydraulic cylinders, overcoming the limitations of traditional magnetostrictive displacement sensors, which exhibit slow response and susceptibility to interference in harsh marine conditions. A dynamic simulation model was developed using AMESim-Simulink co-simulation to analyze the compensation performance of the NeuroVI-based system under step and sinusoidal wave disturbances. Comparative results demonstrate that the NeuroVI feedback system achieves faster response times and superior stability over conventional sensors. Laboratory-scale model tests and real-world application in the installation of a 5.2\u202fMW offshore wind turbine validated the system\u2019s feasibility and robustness, enabling real-time collaborative control of turbine and cylinder displacement to effectively mitigate multi-impact risks. This research provides an innovative approach for deploying neural perception technology in complex marine scenarios and advances the development of neuro-robotic systems in ocean engineering.",
