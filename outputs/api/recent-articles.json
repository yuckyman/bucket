      "title": "Motor unit behaviour adaptations across the lifespan: sex differences in young, middle-aged and old adults",
      "content": "Ageing is associated with neuromuscular decline, and emerging evidence suggests that sex may influence the time course of motor unit adaptations. This study examined age- and sex-related differences in motor unit firing behaviour across young (YG), middle-aged (MA), and older adults (OLD), by integrating high-density EMG motor unit analysis with muscle morphology and daily physical activity measurements. The analysis of single motor unit activity during submaximal isometric contractions of the vastus lateralis revealed that older adults had lower firing rates and a reduced capacity to modulate discharge frequency during force-increasing contractions. In the YG and MA groups, females showed higher motor unit firing rates and variability than males, while in OLD these sex differences were no longer present. Females also demonstrated a steeper decline in firing rate modulation between MA and OLD. Reductions in muscle cross-sectional area and thickness were similar between sexes. Physical activity levels declined with age in both sexes. These findings reveal distinct, sex-specific trajectories of neuromuscular ageing, with females showing greater motor neuron function decline between MA and OLD, in the absence of sex-related differences in the rate of morphological deterioration. The attenuation of sex differences in older age suggests a convergence of neuromuscular profiles with ageing. While physical activity may contribute to the observed sex-specific patterns, other mechanisms related to hormonal shifts warrant further investigation. These insights underscore the importance of considering age and sex in the study of motor control and in the development of targeted interventions to preserve muscle function across the lifespan.",

      "title": "Cross-modal privacy-preserving synthesis and mixture-of-experts ensemble for robust ASD prediction",
      "content": "IntroductionAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis remains complex due to limited access to large-scale multimodal datasets and privacy concerns surrounding clinical data. Traditional methods rely heavily on resource-intensive clinical assessments and are constrained by unimodal or non-adaptive learning models. To address these limitations, this study introduces AutismSynthGen, a privacy-preserving framework for synthesizing multimodal ASD data and enhancing prediction accuracy.Materials and methodsThe proposed system integrates a Multimodal Autism Data Synthesis Network (MADSN), which employs transformer-based encoders and cross-modal attention within a conditional GAN to generate synthetic data across structural MRI, EEG, behavioral vectors, and severity scores. Differential privacy is enforced via DP-SGD (\u03b5\u202f\u2264\u202f1.0). A complementary Adaptive Multimodal Ensemble Learning (AMEL) module, consisting of five heterogeneous experts and a gating network, is trained on both real and synthetic data. Evaluation is conducted on the ABIDE, NDAR, and SSC datasets using metrics such as AUC, F1 score, MMD, KS statistic, and BLEU.ResultsSynthetic augmentation improved model performance, yielding validation AUC gains of \u2265 0.04. AMEL achieved an AUC of 0.98 and an F1 score of 0.99 on real data and approached near-perfect internal performance (AUC\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00, F1\u202f\u2248\u202f1.00) when synthetic data were included. Distributional metrics (MMD\u202f=\u202f0.04; KS\u202f=\u202f0.03) and text similarity (BLEU\u202f=\u202f0.70) demonstrated high fidelity between the real and synthetic samples. Ablation studies confirmed the importance of cross-modal attention and entropy-regularized expert gating.DiscussionAutismSynthGen offers a scalable, privacy-compliant solution for augmenting limited multimodal datasets and enhancing ASD prediction. Future directions include semi-supervised learning, explainable AI for clinical trust, and deployment in federated environments to broaden accessibility while maintaining privacy.",

      "title": "Spatial proteomic mapping of the human and mouse retina using IBEX",
      "content": "Purpose: To generate a comparative spatial proteomic atlas of the human and mouse retina using a refined highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique called Iterative Bleaching Extends Multiplexity (IBEX). Methods: We refined the IBEX workflow by integrating an antibody removal option alongside chemical bleaching. This dual strategy enabled removal of the entire antibody complex allowing for the flexible use of antibodies from the same host species across iterative cycles. Spatial proteomic data were crosscorrelated to existing scRNAseq datasets. We also coupled this workflow with super-resolution imaging via deconvolution and applied it to the retina of healthy human, mouse and the Crb1rd8 mouse model. Results: We successfully imaged over 25 protein markers on human and mouse tissue sections, to generate spatial atlases of the major retinal cell populations. Cross-species protein expression was compared to scRNAseq datasets to identify protein and transcript disparities. Super-resolution IBEX delineated the ultrastructural features of the outer limiting membrane (OLM), identifying CD44 as a core structural component tightly co-localised with a highly organised F-actin belt within Muller glial endfeet. Using the Crb1rd8 mouse model, disruption of this complex was spatially associated with rosette formation and OLM structural failure. Conclusion: Spatial proteomic atlases of the human and mouse retina were generated and correlated to transcriptional data, revealing insights into the arrangement of major retinal cell populations and OLM structure.",

      "title": "Explosive shock wave exposure leads to age-accelerated motor and sensory decline in C. elegans",
      "content": "Background: Military and law enforcement personnel are routinely exposed to shock waves from weapon systems and explosive devices during training and operations. Even when such shock wave exposure results in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) without abnormalities on routine imaging, persistent neurological symptoms may occur. Yet, the biological processes that link an acute blast wave insult to progressive neuronal dysfunction remain poorly defined. Methods: We established Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes as a genetically accessible animal model for blast-related mTBI (br-mTBI). Animals were exposed in gelatin to shock waves generated by a custom-built shock wave generator (SWG), which produces explosive shock waves with an abrupt overpressure peak followed by a negative pressure phase. The resulting pressure-time curves are very similar to the profiles of conventional explosives in free-field setups. To enable mechanistic studies under controlled laboratory conditions, we developed a complementary platform using a medical radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) device. Motor behavior, mechanosensory function, neuronal morphology and cytoskeletal integrity were analyzed during aging. Results: SWG-derived shock waves induced immediate but reversible motor and sensory deficits, followed by an accelerated age-dependent decline in movement and touch sensitivity. The rESWT platform accurately reproduced these phenotypes. Touch receptor neurons showed progressive structural abnormalities, including degeneration, alongside acute PTL-1/Tau mislocalization consistent with cytoskeletal injury. Conclusions: Defined shock wave exposure is sufficient to provoke long-term neuronal functional decline in C. elegans, accompanied by structural deterioration and premature neurodegeneration. This tractable model enables lifelong phenotyping and mechanistic dissection of how an acute shock wave insult progresses to chronic neuronal dysfunction, and provides a scalable platform for identifying molecular and pharmacological modifiers that promote resilience.",

      "title": "Material perception relies on context-dependent active sensing strategies",
      "content": "Material perception is typically studied under passive and highly constrained viewing conditions, thus leaving it unclear whether humans rely on active sampling strategies to resolve perceptual ambiguities. In everyday vision, however, observers naturally move their heads and manipulate objects with their hands to obtain informative cues, thus raising the question of how such exploratory actions contribute to material recognition. We used immersive virtual reality to examine whether viewpoint changes and object manipulations support the discrimination of visually challenging materials, specifically metal versus glass, whose appearances depend strongly on the associated illumination and viewing geometry. On the basis of three experiments, we revealed that observers systematically increased their exploration tendencies when the identity of a material was ambiguous and that this increased movement was associated with higher discrimination accuracy. By independently manipulating head- and hand-based motions, we identified the context-dependent contributions of each modality, revealing that viewpoint changes dominated when multiple objects could be compared simultaneously, whereas object manipulation was more effective when only a single target was available. Moreover, the participants differed in terms of the efficiency of their sampling strategies, and those who employed more informative exploration patterns exhibited both higher accuracy and greater performance gains across different trials. These results demonstrate that material recognition depends on flexible, context-dependent active sensing rather than passive evaluations of static images. Our findings introduce a new framework, according to which material perception emerges from an adaptive perception-action loop, thus highlighting the functional role of exploratory behaviors in complex visual environments.",
