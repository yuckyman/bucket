      "title": "S100A8/A9 Inhibition Reduces Splenic Myelopoiesis and Improves Outcomes After Stroke",
      "content": "Background: Neutrophils are among the earliest immune cells to infiltrate the ischemic brain and contribute to secondary neuronal damage. The alarmin S100 calcium-binding protein A8/A9 (S100A8/A9), predominantly released by neutrophils, is upregulated during this process. Although the bone marrow is recognised as the principal site of neutrophil production via myelopoiesis, the role of the spleen as an immune-responsive organ remains incompletely understood. Methods: In this study, we employed a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in male C57Bl/6 mice and examined immune responses 24 hours post-stroke in the blood, bone marrow and spleen using flow cytometry. To understand the role of S100A8/A9 in modulating stroke-induced myelopoiesis, we administered a small molecule inhibitor of S100A8/A9, ABR-215757, before and after stroke. Results: Neutrophils and S100A8/A9 were found in the infarcted brain tissue. Interestingly, we observed a marked increase in splenic neutrophils, accompanied by an expansion of myeloid progenitors, indicating activation of extramedullary myelopoiesis. Given our previous work showing that S100A8/A9 promotes myelopoiesis, we pharmacologically inhibited S100A8/A9 to determine if this would modulate stroke-induced myelopoiesis. Treatment with ABR-215757 at 24 hours post-stroke led to reduced splenic myelopoiesis, reversed neutrophilia, enhanced forelimb grip strength, and a one-third reduction in infarct size. Conclusion: These findings identify the spleen as a key contributor to neutrophil production following stroke and suggest that targeting S100A8/A9 may attenuate post-stroke inflammation and improve neurological recovery.",

      "title": "Inner-ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labels lateral olivocochlear efferents but results in off-target transfection in the contralateral cochlea and the brain",
      "content": "Gene delivery via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) is a valuable tool for understanding the organization and function of auditory neuronal circuitry. In this study, we explored the use of AAVs injected into the inner ear to transfect the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) pathway, a poorly understood ipsilateral component of the auditory efferent feedback system. AAV serotypes exhibit a wide range of properties, including cell type selectivity and the capacity for retrograde transport, but none of the AAV serotypes used for inner ear delivery have been reported to successfully transfect the LOC pathway. Here, we show that unilateral inner ear delivery of AAV2-retro robustly labeled the LOC pathway. However, the ability of AAV2-retro to diffuse via the cochlear aqueduct from the perilymph into the cerebrospinal fluid resulted in off-target transfection in the brain and the labeling of LOC projections in the contralateral cochlea. The extent of contralateral transfection of LOC neurons depended on the age of the animal and the amount of virus delivered to the inner ear. These findings highlight the importance of considering the dosage and properties of AAV serotype when interpreting experimental results.",

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><strong>What My Project Does</strong></p> <p>Code Buddy is an MCP server that gives Claude Desktop real development capabilities. It provides 23+ tools for file operations (read/write/edit anywhere on your system), git integration (status, diff, log, commits), shell command execution, code formatting (Black/Ruff), and project-wide search. Through the MCP protocol, Claude Desktop can now create complete projects end-to-end, debug issues across your codebase, and handle vibe-coding sessions where you describe what you want and it builds it - all directly from Claude's chat interface without leaving the app.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <p>Built for developers who want Claude Desktop to actually modify code, not just suggest changes. If you work across multiple projects and need an AI assistant with file system access, git operations, and command execution, this is for you. Perfect for rapid prototyping, debugging multi-file issues, or building features conversationally. Currently production-ready and in active development - I'm using it daily and adding features as needed.</p> <p><strong>Comparison</strong></p> <p>Unlike specialized MCP servers (filesystem-only, database-only), Code Buddy consolidates development workflows into one server. It supports absolute paths system-wide (not limited to one project), includes git integration that other servers lack, and provides both MCP server and CLI interfaces. While <a href=\"/u/modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\">u/modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem</a> offers basic file access, Code Buddy adds git, shell commands, code formatting, and cross-project editing - enabling full project creation and debugging workflows that isolated tools can't handle.</p> <p>GitHub Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Abhi-vish/code-buddy\">https://github.com/Abhi-vish/code-buddy</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vishbhishek\"> /u/vishbhishek </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgmfun/code_buddy_extend_claude_desktop_with_23/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pgmfun/code_buddy_extend_claude_desktop_with_23/\">[comments]</a></span>",
