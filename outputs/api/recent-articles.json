      "title": "An Emergentist Account of Language in the Brain\u2014Seeking Neural Synergies Behind Human Uniqueness",
      "content": "Cognitive neuroscience has become increasingly open to views of human cognitive faculties as emergent properties\u2014as higher-level products of synergies between brain structures handling qualitatively different functions. This new perspective mitigates claims that cognitive abilities are tied to localized, domain-specific brain systems. In this changing landscape, the neurobiology of language has lagged behind, with virtually no mature theory apt to guide an exploration of language as an emergent function of the human brain. Combining evidence that linguistic processing is distributed across neurocognitive systems supporting (among others) semantic cognition, executive functions, and articulatory-motor control with recent advances in studying neural synergies, we propose a model of language as a deeply synergistic phenomenon that is both decoupled from its lower-level constituents and capable of exerting downward causal powers over them, accounting for its key role in human adaptive behavior. In considering the implications it has in our understanding of the place of language within the broader infrastructure of human behavior, this novel perspective aims to move the neurobiology of language forward in a new era of the cognitive neuroscience.",

      "title": "Impact of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation on Event-related Potentials during a Response Inhibition Task",
      "content": "As an emerging neuromodulation technique, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) has shown promise in enhancing cognitive abilities. The present study used a combination of the go/no-go task and the stop-signal task experimental paradigm to examine the cognitive effects of taVNS on participants' EEG measures. Sixty-one healthy participants were randomly assigned to either the stimulation group or the sham group. Participants in the stimulation group received 100 Hz and 25 Hz stimulation in a counterbalanced order. We compared behavioral and EEG data before and after stimulation, and observed significant effects. The findings revealed that a 100-Hz taVNS significantly reduced participants' N2 latency in the stop trial, indicating potential improvement response inhibition. In addition, we noted a decreasing trend in alpha, theta, and delta band power during response inhibition after receiving a 100-Hz taVNS. These results suggest that a 100-Hz taVNS can enhance participants' response inhibition abilities, indicating its potential as a therapeutic approach for modulating cognitive functions.",

      "title": "Confidence and Insight into Working Memory Are Shaped by Attention and Recent Performance",
      "content": "Working memory is capacity-limited, and our ability to access information from working memory is variable, but selective attention to working memory contents can improve performance. People are able to make introspective judgments regarding the quality of their memories, and these judgments are linked to objective memory performance. However, it remains unknown whether benefits of internally directed attention on memory performance occur alongside commensurate changes in introspective judgments. Across two experiments, we used retrospective cues (retrocues) during working-memory maintenance to direct attention to items in memory. We then examined their consequence on introspective judgments. In the second experiment, we provided trial-wise feedback on performance. We found that selective attention improved confidence judgments and not just performance of the probed item. We were also able to judge participants' genuine insight into working-memory contents through the correlation between confidence judgments and memory quality. Neurophysiologically, alpha desynchronization correlated first with memory error and then confidence during retrocueing, suggesting a sequential process of attentional enhancement of memory contents and introspective insight. Furthermore, we showed that participants can use feedback on the accuracy of confidence judgments to update their beliefs across time, according to performance. Our results emphasize flexibility in working memory by showing we can selectively modulate our confidence about its contents based on internally directed attention or objective feedback.",

      "title": "On carrier frequency in transcutaneous spinal cord electrical stimulation: a narrative review",
      "content": "Objective. Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) using kilohertz frequency carrier modulation has emerged as a non-invasive neuromodulation approach to improve motor recovery and reduce pain. Early application of 5\u201310 kHz modulated pulses for tSCS has shown promising results in spinal cord (SC) injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. Approach. This narrative review synthesizes electrophysiological, computational and clinical evidence to assess how kilohertz modulation influences spinal and corticospinal excitability and analgesia. A total of 20 preclinical and clinical studies comparing the effects of kHz-modulated and conventional stimulation pulses were reviewed. Main results. The results indicate that kilohertz modulated tSCS increases tolerance to stimulation, but requires a higher charge to evoke motor responses in healthy participants and individuals with post-stroke motor disorder. Compared to conventional stimulation, modulated stimulation recruits afferents less efficiently at motor threshold intensity but appears to engage broader corticospinal circuits, especially near or below threshold. Frequency-specific effects include prolonged spinal inhibition, frequency-dependent modulation of supraspinal input, and selective activation of inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn. Computational study supports these observations, showing that kilohertz pulses produce delayed action potential initiation due to alternating depolarization cycles. A comparative functional study has shown that modulated tSCS improves motor function in individuals with SC injury more significantly than conventional stimulation. Significance. This narrative review highlights gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of modulated tSCS, suggests directions for further research and will be useful in planning studies on the mechanisms behind tSCS with and without carrier frequency. It also holds engineering relevance for the optimal design of stimulation devices.",

      "title": "Helical neural implants for intracerebral drug delivery",
      "content": "Objective. Neurological disorders often arise from specific regions of dysfunction in the brain. One approach to target these pathologic regions is through chemical delivery using intracerebral implants. Previous works have designed implants that are small and flexible, minimizing the mechanical mismatch between inorganic implants and soft organic brain tissue. Most of these implants are simple cylindrical catheters with inflow and outflow ports at either end of the cylinder. This limits the region and volume of tissue that can be dosed. We sought to develop novel catheter designs that permit targeting of larger volumes of brain tissue while maintaining minimal footprint to minimize gliosis. Approach. We present the design, fabrication, and testing of a novel helical-shaped microfluidic catheter we term SPIRAL (Strategic Precision Infusion for Regional Administration of Liquid). SPIRAL leverages rational fluidic design of multiple fluid outflow ports to vary infused fluid spatial distribution across brain regions. We used in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models to test the fluid dynamic functionality and chronic viability of SPIRAL. Results. Our computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) models illustrate how SPIRAL can be configured to permit simultaneous dosing through multiple outflow ports yielding a variable fluid distribution compared to a straight catheter. We show how CFD in silico models can be used to optimize dimensions of channel openings across SPIRAL, to achieve uniform flow through channels and validate these results in vitro. We show how chronically implanted SPIRAL catheters do not increase gliosis compared to standard straight catheters of similar dimensions or materials. Significance. Our helical intracerebral drug delivery catheter facilitates fluid localization while maintaining minimal invasiveness. SPIRAL could enable multiregional brain access and improve therapeutic efforts in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) is proposed to reduce this cost by changing only a tiny subset of trainable parameters. But, the GPU memory footprint during training is not effectively reduced in PETL. This issue happens because trainable parameters from these methods are generally tightly entangled with the backbone, such that a lot of intermediate states have to be stored for back...",

At the same time, active learning (AL) has shown great potential in reducing annotation costs in related tasks, which can maximize model performance within very limited labeled data. In this paper, we explore active learning for vision-based 3DOD for the first time. Inspired by the entropy analysis, we involve...",
