These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

      "title": "Observations of anisotropic paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility in the primate brain",
      "content": "Bulk magnetic susceptibility in the brain white matter is known to be diamagnetic and anisotropic due to the ordered myelin lipids. While paramagnetic iron is widely present in the brain, it is typically not considered to contribute to anisotropy. Using experimental MRI and computational techniques, this study explores the competing contribution of diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances to the susceptibility anisotropy. Multi-echo gradient-echo imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging data from a paraformaldehyde-fixed post-mortem chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) brain was analyzed. A computational method, DECOMPOSE-QSM, was used to separate paramagnetic susceptibility and diamagnetic susceptibility components. As expected, diamagnetic components showed significant anisotropy; unexpectedly, paramagnetic components also exhibited strong anisotropy in deep gray matter and parts of white matter. This may arise from the geometric arrangement of iron-rich cellular compartments, such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, along nerve fibers. This method enables further exploration of tissue-specific contributions to susceptibility anisotropy.",

      "title": "Risky Choices After Frontal Brain Injury: Differential Effects in Self vs Other-Decision Contexts",
      "content": "Frontal lobe integrity is crucial for assessing risk and making informed decisions. This study investigated how frontal lobe lesions affect the computational mechanisms underlying risky choice, particularly when decisions impact oneself versus another person. A Patient Group of 20 individuals with frontal cortex damage and a Control Group of 20 matched individuals performed a gambling task, making accept/reject decisions on mixed-outcome gambles for themselves (\"Self\") or an anonymous other (\"Other\"). We provide a mechanistic account of choice behavior using Prospect Theory, the leading behavioral model of decision-making under risk, to quantify parameters for utility curvature, loss aversion, and probability weighting. Behaviorally, the Patient Group accepted significantly more disadvantageous gambles for themselves than did the Control Group yet showed a trend toward greater caution when choosing for others. Prospect Theory modeling revealed a specific computational phenotype for this behavior. Compared to the Control Group, the Patient Group exhibited significantly more pronounced utility curvature (lower , {beta}) and more linear, less distorted probability weighting (higher {gamma}). While patients also showed a trend toward lower loss aversion ({lambda}), this difference was not statistically significant. This combination of altered utility and probability processing explains their paradoxical risk-seeking. These findings suggest that frontal cortex damage disrupts the computation of subjective value, leading to a distinctive decision-making profile marked by altered utility curvature and reduced sensitivity to outcome magnitudes. This computational characterization deepens our understanding of frontal lobe contributions to decision-making and can inform targeted rehabilitation strategies.",

      "content": "Although the fundamental architecture of metazoan nervous systems is typically established in the embryo, substantial numbers of neurons are added during post-natal development while existing neurons expand in size, refine connectivity, and undergo additional differentiation. To reveal the underlying molecular determinants of post-embryonic neurogenesis and maturation, we have produced gene expression profiles of all neuron types and their progenitors in the first larval stage (L1) of C. elegans. Comparisons of the L1 profile to the embryo and to the later L4 larval stage identified thousands of differentially expressed genes across individual neurons throughout the nervous system. Key neuropeptide signaling networks, for example, are remodeled during larval development. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed potential transcription factors driving the temporal changes in gene expression across the nervous system, including a broad role for the heterochronic gene lin-14. We utilized available connectomic data of juvenile animals in combination with our neuron-specific atlas to identify potential molecular determinants of membrane contact and synaptic connectivity. These expression data are available through a user-friendly interface at CeNGEN.org for independent investigations of the maturation, connectivity and function of a developing nervous system.",

      "title": "Cannabis-enriched oral Actinomyces induces anxiety-like behavior via impairing mitochondria and GABA signaling",
      "content": "The human oral microbiome is increasingly recognized as a contributor to brain health, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous work revealed that oral Actinomyces species was enriched in chronic cannabis smokers. Here, we show oral inoculation of cannabis use-associated Actinomyces species, especially A. meyeri, to wildtype C57BL/6 mice leads to anxiety-like behaviors, non-region-specific microglia activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced GABAergic neurotransmission, without evidence of bacterial translocation to the brain, neuroinflammation, and memory decline. Notably, Actinomyces species producing metabolites, i.e., arginine and argininosuccinate, were increased in both oral swabs and brain following inoculation in vivo. These Actinomyces species-producing metabolites induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurons in vitro, indicating a neuropathogenic role and aligning with reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in vivo. Together, these results suggest that oral cannabis-associated dysbiosis impacts behavior through mitochondrial stress and impaired inhibitory signaling, indicating the oral to brain metabolic axis is potentially consequential in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Inter-areal coupling for cognition through coincident oscillatory transients",
      "content": "How do large-scale brain networks interact to enable cognition? Correlated oscillations, a mechanism for inter-areal interactions, can be expressed as phase coherence or amplitude co-fluctuations. While considerable work has investigated the functional roles of phase coherence, little is known about whether and how the coincidence of high-amplitude oscillations across the cortex can impact cognition. Here, we demonstrate that inter-areal amplitude-coupling related to cognitive dynamics mainly reflects coincident oscillatory transients, rather than sustained oscillations. Capitalizing on the spatio-temporal resolution of brain-wide magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a behavioral task probing attention and decision-making our findings reveal behaviorally relevant transient oscillatory networks: First, coincidences of oscillatory transients in the alpha and beta frequency range increase prior to correct decisions in a parieto-frontal network. Second, during attention allocation coincident oscillatory transients increase in visual, medial parietal and lateral prefrontal networks in the theta/alpha frequency range. We propose that brain-wide coincident oscillatory events are a key signature of inter-areal interactions during cognition.",

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",
