      "title": "Flexible selection of working memory representations to reduce cognitive cost",
      "content": "Across psychology, economics, and decision science, it is well established that choosing a good internal representation can make complex problems easier to solve. This idea, central to theories of bounded rationality and heuristics, suggests that intelligent behavior depends not only on what is stored in working memory, but on the format in which it is stored. Whether non-human animals flexibly select internal formats, and how such choices are implemented in neural circuits, has remained unclear. Here we show that rats adjust the format of working memory to reduce cognitive load. When a task encourages an action-based code, rats maintain the relevant information as a stable motor plan supported by frontal cortex. When the same task is reformulated to make this code costly, they instead store a sensory trace in auditory cortex. These strategy shifts are rapid and reliable, revealing that rats can switch between distinct neural circuits to store information in the most economical internal format. These results demonstrate that flexible representational selection is not unique to humans but is present in rodents and reflected in circuit-level reallocation of working memory. This establishes a neural basis for classic theories linking problem representation to computational efficiency and provides a path toward a neural circuit-level description of selecting internal formats to reduce cognitive costs.",

      "title": "High-Frequency Activity Encodes the Temporal Dynamics of Hierarchical Prediction Errors in Humans: An Electrocorticography Study",
      "content": "Prediction error refers to the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory input. Its hierarchical organization has been demonstrated through decomposed brain responses in the local-global paradigm, where temporal regularities are established locally at individual stimulus transitions and globally across multi-tone sequence structures. In macaques and marmosets, local and global prediction-error signals have both been found in high-frequency oscillations (60-150 Hz) recorded with ECoG. In humans, however, these signals have primarily been observed in a lower frequency range (30-100 Hz) using EEG. Here, we recorded human ECoG to achieve higher signal fidelity, enabling examination of neural oscillations above 100 Hz (high-frequency activity, HFA), which are believed to be closely linked to local spiking activity. Eight participants listened to auditory sequences that either followed their local and global regularities (local and global standards) or violated them (local and global deviants). Robust HFA responses were observed for the local deviants, but these responses were reduced when the deviants were expected based on the global regularity, indicating both levels of prediction-error processes contribute to the observed activity. Importantly, these HFA responses could be decomposed into two subcomponents: an early component reflecting local prediction-error signals localized to lateral auditory regions, and a late component reflecting global prediction-error signals prominent in both lateral auditory and frontal cortices. Together, these findings demonstrate that neural oscillations above 100 Hz encode hierarchical prediction errors not only in non-human primates but also in humans.",

      "title": "Top-down feedback can explain the existence of working memory traces in early visual cortex",
      "content": "The temporary storage of visual memories is known to engage early visual cortex (EVC), where mnemonic content is presumed to be stored in weak or latent states. Two mechanisms have been suggested to underlie this storage: Top-down feedback from anterior cortical sites, and short-term synaptic plasticity (STSP) traces laid down by previous sensory inputs. Here, we tested if these mechanisms can account for two hallmarks of working memory, namely, the flexible selection of information from working memory, and the robustness of working memory against distraction. Simulating firing rates in a neural network model of working memory, we show that STSP cannot easily account for selection of information from within the working memory store, and is not robust to visual distraction. Rather, any input that passes through the visual system is briefly remembered, irrespective of its relevance. In contrast, top-down feedback can establish durable mnemonic signals in EVC that reflect currently task-relevant working memory contents and are robust to distraction. We argue that feedback is a parsimonious explanation for the existence of mnemonic signals in EVC, given that the storage of working memories is distributed across a hierarchy of cortical sites, which are known to have widespread feedback projections to visual cortex.",

      "title": "Predicting functional topography of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy at scale",
      "content": "Topographic organization is a fundamental principle of the brain, whereby adjacent cortical locations represent adjacent features in sensory or cognitive space. Current methodologies for obtaining individual-specific topographic maps either require resource-intensive functional neuroimaging data or, when using population atlases, lack precision for individual-level inference, limiting large-scale studies of individual differences. Here, we developed deepRetinotopy toolbox, a deep learning-based application for predicting topographic organization of the human visual cortex from cortical anatomy. We show that our toolbox accurately predicts retinotopic organization using only standard structural MRI scans acquired under diverse conditions, including varying imaging sites and scanner types. We then demonstrate that predicted maps can be leveraged to automatically generate individual-specific visual area boundaries, overcoming common biases in manual annotations. Finally, we estimate age-related changes in visual cortex organization by retrospectively applying our method to 11,060 anatomical scans, revealing that group differences in primary visual cortex organization are predictable from cortical anatomy.",

      "title": "Single-channel EEG-based sleep stage classification via hybrid data distillation",
      "content": "Objective. With the advancement of deep learning technologies, more and more researchers have begun developing end-to-end automatic sleep stage classification frameworks. However, these frameworks typically require access to large electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets for training, which imposes a significant computational burden. Furthermore, EEG data contains patient privacy information, and using such data for training raises concerns about privacy infringement. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid data distillation method. We aim to enable single-channel EEG sleep stage classification with less training cost and privacy risk by distilling large real datasets into a tiny, privacy-preserving synthetic set for training from scratch. Approach. We first apply the gradient matching method to optimize the randomly initialized synthetic dataset. The gradient changes in the early stages of model training can quickly reduce the performance gap between the synthetic dataset and the source dataset. Subsequently, to avoid oscillations near the optimal solution during gradient matching, we switch to distribution matching to further optimize the synthetic dataset. This method aligns the data distribution at a global level, enhancing overall consistency. In addition, we adopt a novel mini-batch iteration method to assist the synthetic dataset in learning temporal dependencies. Main results. We validated our framework on three public datasets and achieved robust results. Significance. This study proposes an efficient and robust hybrid data distillation algorithm, providing a feasible approach for implementing sleep stage staging based on privacy protection.",

      "content": "From 2012 to 2023, the American Psychological Association served as publisher of <em>Psychomusicology: Music, Mind, and Brain</em>. Annabel Cohen and Mark Schmuckler were the successive editors-in-chiefs during this time. As the journal is ceasing publication, the two editors reflect on the development and progress of the journal in the context of the history of psychology and publication trends. They present their review in 10 short movements each with a unique musical emotional expressivity: <em>overture, amabile, vivace, elegy doloroso, sforzando, capriccio, con brio, pendolo, agilmente,</em> and <em>finale risonante</em>, ending on a very upbeat note! Early on, <em>Psychomusicology</em> offered a much-needed research forum for the psychology of music. More recently, the recognized importance of music psychology to almost all areas of psychology has led to increasing numbers of outlets for publication. During the 12 recent years under APA\u2019s stewardship, the journal more than doubled the number of articles published since the journal\u2019s inception in 1981. The entire corpus of almost 600 articles represents foundational and well-cited contributions to such current research areas as musical expectancy, performance excellence, musical development, neuroscience, emotion, preference, and film music, among others. Cohen and Schmuckler express deep gratitude to the authors, past editorial board members, and reviewers for their contributions to this corpus, and to the American Psychological Association Publications office and staff both for support and, importantly, for holding and making accessible in perpetuity the outstanding scholarship within the archives of <em>Psychomusicology: Music Mind & Brain and Psychomusicology: A Journal of Music Cognition</em>.

      "title": "AAV-mediated regeneration of neurons in injury-induced and inherited retinal degeneration",
      "content": "Loss of retinal neurons is a leading cause of irreversible vision impairment, yet adult mammalian retinas lack the ability to regenerate these cells. In this study, we developed an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based strategy to reprogram endogenous Muller glia into retinal neurons. Using stringent genetic lineage tracing, immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology and single-cell multiomic profiling, we show that AAV delivery of a stabilized, phospho-insensitive Neurogenin2 variant (Neurog2-9SA) efficiently converts Muller glia into multiple types of retinal neurons, including bipolar, starburst amacrine, and a small population of photoreceptor-like cells, in both injury-induced and inherited retinal degeneration models. The generated neurons exhibit electrical properties of retinal neurons, light-evoked responses and integrate into existing retinal circuitry. Single-cell multiomics analysis reveal that Neurog2-9SA induces reprogramming by remodeling chromatin accessibility, activating neurogenic transcriptional networks, and represses glial identity programs. Inhibiting Notch signaling markedly enhances reprogramming efficiency. Together, these findings establish Neurog2-9SA as a potent and clinically relevant factor for AAV-mediated reprogramming and provide a foundation for approaches to regenerate neuronal cells and restore function in retinal diseases.",

      "content": "Tauopathies, including Alzheimer disease, are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological aggregation of the microtubule associated protein Tau (MAPT). This study explores the neuroprotective properties of anastrozole, a clinical Aromatase inhibitor, in both a Drosophila tauopathy model expressing human MAPTR406W and isogenic pairs of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons expressing MAPT mutations. The Aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, initially identified in a Drosophila MAPTR406W drug screen, reduced oxidative stress and Tau phosphorylation in cultured cortical neurons. Its protective effects were not mediated by Aromatase activity or cholesterol metabolism: screening in Drosophila identified CYP4V2 as a potential off-target. Knockdown of CYP4V2 in MAPTR406W neurons recapitulated protection against oxidative stress-induced cell death. These findings position anastrozole and its off-target CYP4V2 as novel therapeutic avenues for primary tauopathies and potentially Alzheimer disease and related dementias by reducing Tau phosphorylation and susceptibility to oxidative stress.",
