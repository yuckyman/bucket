      "content": "1. Traditional methods of assessing egg freshness, such as sensory evaluation and specific gravity testing, are labour-intensive and destructive. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) technologies offer significant advantages in terms of speed, accuracy and non-invasiveness, enabling real-time monitoring of egg quality during production, transportation, storage and sale.2. A review was conducted to evaluate various NDT techniques, including optical methods (such as visible - near infrared...",

Pachychoroid neovasculopathy is a relatively recently recognized clinical entity of choroidal neovascularization, belonging to the pachychoroid spectrum, for which intravitreal therapy (IVT) is the standard of care. The main aeromedical considerations are degradation of visual function from disease progression, which could preclude aircrew from flying duties, and the compatibility of...",
