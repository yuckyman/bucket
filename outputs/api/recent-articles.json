While foundation models (FMs) show promise in medical imaging, their optimal selection and fine-tuning strategies for classifying carotid atherosclerosis from retinal images remain unclear. Using data from 39,620 individuals, we evaluated four vision FMs with three fine-tuning methods. Performance was evaluated by predictive performance, clinical utility by survival analysis for future CVD...",
