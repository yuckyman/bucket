      "title": "Theta and gamma transcranial alternating current stimulation modulate Mandarin consonant and lexical tone perception",
      "content": "A theta/gamma oscillatory neural mechanism has been postulated to explain the auditory sampling of hierarchical syllable-phoneme structure with corresponding speech rates or linguistic hierarchies (theta for syllable and gamma for phoneme). Yet, whether such a mechanism is generalizable to Mandarin Chinese, a language that both has suprasegmental phonemes in the form of lexical tones and contains more monosyllabic words, which may lead to higher reliance on either phonemic-level or syllabic-level perceptual representations, is unclear. In this study, we applied transcranial electric stimulation with either theta or gamma alternating currents (tACS) to bilateral auditory cortices in healthy Mandarin-speaking participants during a consonant or tone identification task in quiet or noisy environments. Results showed that theta tACS impaired consonant identification in quiet, specifically, and generally prolonged reaction times across tasks and environments. Gamma tACS, however, only delayed tone identification in quiet. Besides, both theta and gamma tACS modulated perceptual decision-making parameters, leading to increased boundary thresholds (cautiousness of decision) and altered response biases in the perceptual decision of both consonants and tones, as evidenced by the hierarchical drift-diffusion model (HDDM). These findings indicate that theta oscillations causally support the perception of Mandarin syllables, with consonants and lexical tones presumably embedded in syllable-level representations, regardless of task difficulty. Gamma activity, however, is presumably engaged in supporting fast-changing and fine-grained acoustic features in a modulatory manner.",

      "title": "Cholinergic-dependent dopamine signals in mouse dorsal striatum are regulated by frontal but not sensory cortices",
      "content": "Everyday decisions depend on linking sensory stimuli with actions and outcomes. The striatum supports these sensorimotor associations through dopamine-dependent plasticity. Thus, the timing and magnitude of dopamine release is critical for learning. Recent work has characterized a local striatal microcircuit in which cholinergic interneurons (CINs) modulate dopamine release via acetylcholine activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine axons. Here, we show that visual stimuli evoke dopamine responses in the dorsomedial striatum through this cholinergic-dependent mechanism. Using anatomical and functional methods to identify which pathways elicit these signals, we found that primary visual cortex and early sensory areas that project to the striatum exhibited only weak connectivity to CINs, despite robust connectivity to projection neurons, and were unable to drive dopamine release. In contrast, frontal cortical regions, including the prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices, strongly recruited CINs and acetylcholine, producing robust dopamine release both ex vivo and in vivo. These findings reveal a fundamental distinction between sensory and frontal cortical inputs to the striatum, demonstrating that only the latter provide effective access to cholinergic-dependent dopamine signaling. This work establishes a framework for understanding how cortical circuits shape striatal dopamine to support reinforcement learning.",

      "title": "Diagnosis-Optimized Dynamic Feature Learning Reveals Altered Default Mode Network Connectivity in Schizophrenia",
      "content": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is characterized by widespread neural dysconnectivity, with particularly pronounced alterations in the default mode network (DMN)- a set of brain regions involved in self-referential thought and mind-wandering. We investigated dynamic functional connectivity within the DMN in SZ by analyzing resting-state fMRI data from two independent cohorts (FBIRN and COBRE). Using a novel iterative feature-removal clustering approach focusing on DMN independent components, we identified distinct recurring connectivity states while iteratively removing dominant connectivity features to reveal subtler network patterns. This approach iteratively refines the set of features considered, ensuring a more balanced representation and facilitating the identification of significant interactions that would otherwise be overlooked. Cluster centroids for the four connectivity states were highly similar across both datasets, reflecting stable shared DMN patterns. State occupancy was compared between participants with SZ and healthy controls, and associations with clinical symptom severity were examined. The SZ group exhibited significant alterations in DMN connectivity dynamics, spending more time than controls in certain connectivity states characterized by atypical DMN coupling and less time in a state reflecting a normative DMN configuration. A comparison between the FBIRN and COBRE datasets reveals both similarities and differences in occupancy rate (OCR) states. Overall, the pattern of group effects converged while state-specific divergences likely reflected protocol/sample differences rather than conflicting biology. Crucially, the explainability pipeline yielded a highly similar feature-removal order across datasets, indicating that the same DMN edges drive the diagnostic signal in both cohorts. Several OCR effects also tracked symptom ratings, linking abnormal DMN dynamics to clinical expression. Our findings suggest that SZ is characterized by reproducible disturbances in the temporal organization of DMN connectivity. These dynamic DMN features may serve as potential biomarkers for SZ, offering diagnostic and clinical utility by capturing network dysfunction that static connectivity measures could overlook.",
