      "title": "Psilocybin rapidly, but not immediately, reverses reward learning deficits in a durable manner in an inflammatory rat model of depressive symptoms",
      "content": "The serotonergic psychedelic, psilocybin, shows potential for rapid and sustained antidepressant effects but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Using a chronic interferon-alpha-induced rat model of depression, we show acute psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) reverses impaired reward-induced biases within 24hrs, with effects enduring for at least 7 days. This suggests psilocybin can restore blunted reward processing, an effect which could significantly contribute to its sustained antidepressant effects.",

      "content": "A specific time window during which neural circuits undergo dramatic changes in response to individual experiences is known as the critical period (CP). Developing methods to reopen the CP after its closure could lead to the establishment of effective treatment approaches. The retinogeniculate (RG) synapses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) undergo experience-dependent remodeling only during the limited period of development. We investigated the effects of astrocyte manipulation on the restoration of RG synapse plasticity after the CP termination. Astrocytic stimulation with the designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) after the CP closure caused RG synapse remodeling in the dark-reared mice but not in those reared in normal conditions. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of dLGN astrocytes implicated the underlying mechanisms of astrocyte-induced RG synaptic plasticity. Therefore, astrocytes can regulate the susceptibility of RG synapses to experience-dependent plasticity after CP termination.",

      "title": "SnapG: An Automated Tool for Myelin g-ratio Measurement with Batch Processing Capability",
      "content": "The g-ratio, calculated as the axon diameter divided by the total myelinated fiber diameter, is widely used to assess the degree of myelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Changes in g-ratios accompany demyelinating, hypomyelinating, and remyelinating conditions, and can also result from activity-dependent, adaptive myelination. Although manual tracing from electron micrographs has been the gold-standard to measure g-ratios, this process is laborious and limits throughput. To address this challenge, we developed SnapG, an automated and user friendly software tool to streamline g-ratio analysis from electron micrographs. SnapG implements an end to end pipeline for axon and myelin segmentation on EM images. The tool integrates robust segmentation and post processing steps to extract axon and fiber diameters and generates both per image and cohort level summary statistics. SnapG produces g-ratio distributions that agree well with expert manual annotations and established tools across imaging modalities. It reduces user intervention, supports large image and batch processing, and achieves faster processing times while delivering accurate, reproducible measurements. SnapG's automated reporting thereby facilitates high throughput analyses and improves consistency across experiments. SnapG can accelerate studies of myelin biology and provides a practical alternative to existing tools.",

Claude wrote the initial script fairly quickly, but as these things go it required manual tweaking and second guessing myself on the images flagged as outliers. I'll admit I got embarrassingly far along before realizing that Claude hadn't enabled pytorch's GPU support; a real facepalm moment on my part.<p>For those curious, brave, or crazy enough to dive in the source code is available here under an MIT license:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/MrEricSir/munimet.ro\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/MrEricSir/munimet.ro</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637283\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637283</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi HN! In the past few months my team and I have been working on Tusk Drift, a system that records real API traffic from your service, then replays those requests as deterministic tests. Outbound I/O (databases, HTTP calls, etc.) gets automatically mocked using the recorded data.<p>Problem we're trying to solve: Writing API tests is tedious, and hand-written mocks drift from reality. We wanted tests that stay realistic because they come from real traffic.<p>versus mocking libraries: Tools like VCR/Nock intercept HTTP within your tests. Tusk Drift records full request/response traces externally (HTTP, DB, Redis, etc.) and replays them against your running service, no test code or fixtures to write/maintain.<p>How it works:<p>1. Add a lightweight SDK (we currently support Python and Node.js)<p>2. Record traffic in any environment.<p>3. Run `tusk run`, the CLI sandboxes your service and serves mocks via Unix socket<p>We run this in CI on every PR. Also been using it as a test harness for AI coding agents, they can make changes, run `tusk run`, and get immediate feedback without needing live dependencies.<p>Source: <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/tusk-drift-cli</a><p>Demo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo</a><p>Happy to answer questions!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637322\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46637322</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "Aging macaques bridge the translational gap in perivascular space biology",
      "content": "The prevalence of MR-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) is age-dependent in rhesus macaques. Automated quantification in 94 male and female animals ranging 5-28 years of age demonstrated a robust association between age and PVS burden, with an anatomical distribution paralleling that of humans. Preliminary ex vivo validation confirmed that the MRI-detected tubular structures correspond to perivascular spaces. These findings establish the rhesus macaque as a tractable model for understanding the role of perivascular dysfunction in age-related brain vulnerability.",

      "title": "Distinct CA1 inputs support shifts in neural dimensionality and memory resolution",
      "content": "Event-based memories may be encoded with high (e.g., episodic) or low (e.g., gist) mnemonic resolution. While the CA1 region of the hippocampus encodes events at both scales, it is unclear how such dual coding emerges. Consistent with theoretical predictions (1,2), here we show that trisynaptic (from CA3) and monosynaptic (from the medial entorhinal cortex) projections to CA1 encode high- and low-resolution event-based memories, respectively. Recruitment of the trisynaptic pathway during contextual fear conditioning promotes feedforward inhibition of CA1 via activation of parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons. This allows sparse encoding of event-based memories in high-dimensional neural states that support high-resolution contextual fear memories, where mice exhibit conditioned fear only in the training context and not similar contexts. Inhibiting this input during training reduces activation of CA1 PV+ interneurons and feedforward inhibition, shifting neural dynamics to low-dimensional states that support low-resolution contextual fear memories where mice freeze in the training context and similar contexts. These experiments identify a circuit-based mechanism that causally links the dimensionality of CA1 neural dynamics to mnemonic resolution.",

      "title": "Plasma proteomics reveal heterogeneous subtypes of depression linked to inflammation and aging",
      "content": "The clinical heterogeneity of depression has defied biological classification, limiting personalized treatment. Previous neuroimaging- or symptom-based subtyping of depression failed to clarify the underlying pathoetiology, while plasma proteins which integrates signals from multiple organ systems, offers a promising way to define biologically grounded subtypes. Using plasma proteomics from 2,127 incident depression cases in a cohort of 53000 individuals, we identified three biologically distinct subtypes differing in inflammation, aging, and metabolic profiles. The most prevalent subtype (inflammation/aging) was characterized by aging-related inflammation, poorest prognosis with hippocampal atrophy and highest suicide risk, mediated by age-related amygdalar atrophy; this subtype had highest anhedonia burden. A distinct inflammation/energy dysregulation group had metabolic pathway enrichment with high inflammation and lifestyle risk factors (smoking) but no aging trend, predominantly physical/psychomotor symptoms and decreased thalamic volume. In contrast, the inflammation-resilient group had the lowest inflammatory proteomic loading, lowest depression severity, more resilient lifestyle and increased hippocampal volume. These proteomic signatures, detectable years before symptom onset, enable risk stratification and suggest subtype-specific targeted physical and lifestyle interventions.",
