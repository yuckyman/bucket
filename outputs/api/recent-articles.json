      "title": "Membrane potential dynamics of peripheral cold-sensitive neurons in Drosophila larvae",
      "content": "Drosophila larvae sense diverse external stimuli through peripheral multidendritic (md) sensory neurons, among which Class III (CIII) neurons are essential for detecting noxious cold temperatures. Previous extracellular recordings showed that CIII neurons produce a characteristic phasic-tonic response to cold: a transient high-frequency spiking phase, during which about half of the neurons burst, followed by frequency adaptation. Here, we report the first intracellular recordings from CIII neurons, allowing us to characterize the membrane potential dynamics underlying their cold-evoked spiking responses. At rest, CIII neurons showed membrane potential fluctuations that occasionally triggered sporadic spikes. Cold stimulation induced a sustained depolarization that evoked a train of spikes, with spike rates peaking at 2-12 spikes/s within the first 5 s, followed by a gradual decline. About half of the neurons exhibited occasional bursts, in which clusters of 2-6 spikes at 10-120 Hz superimposed on a brief depolarizing hump. Cold stimulation also increased input resistance and amplified electrotonically spreading spikes, suggesting enhanced electrotonic signaling from distal sites via an increased space constant. Together, these findings provide key insights into the electrophysiological mechanisms of sensory encoding in peripheral neurons and establish a framework for dissecting the ionic and structural mechanisms of cold transduction.",

      "title": "Disruption of Pre-Bo\u0308tzinger Complex neuropeptidergic tonality controls fear and metabolic response",
      "content": "Stress profoundly impacts systemic metabolism, yet the central circuits linking stress responses to peripheral metabolic regulation remain poorly defined. Here, we identify the preBotzinger complex (preBotC), a brainstem breathing rhythm generator, as a key stress-responsive hub coordinating metabolic adaptations. Using viral tracing, we show that preBotC neurons project to brown adipose tissue and liver, and that a subset of these projection neurons expresses the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor PAC1R, positioning PACAP signaling as a critical modulator of this circuit. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed robust preBotC activation under stress, while spatial transcriptomics demonstrated altered neuronal metabolic circuitry in preBotC following PAC1R ablation. PAC1R knockdown in preBotC combined with stress resulted in blunted respiratory rhythmicity, reduced sympathetic innervation, and suppression of energy expenditure and lipid metabolic pathways in brown fat, while reprogramming hepatic transcriptional networks toward amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. These findings define a unique neuropeptidergic brainstem periphery circuit integrating stress, respiration, and metabolism.",

      "title": "MyoGen: Unified Biophysical Modeling of Human Neuromotor Activity and Resulting Signals",
      "content": "Understanding human motor control requires integrating cortical and spinal cord activity, muscle mechanics, and electrophysiology, levels that are often studied separately. We present MyoGen, an open-source framework that unifies spinal circuitry, proprioceptive feedback, musculotendon dynamics, cortical activity, and multimodal electromyography (EMG) generation in a single, interoperable platform. Spinal motor neurons and the resulting motor unit (MU) action potentials represent the only neural cells that can be accessed at scale in humans. We used human MU ensembles to validate our model across a wide range of experimental conditions. Using data-driven optimization, we found that MyoGen produces MU population activity that closely matches experimental discharge-rate distributions and discharge variability across human muscles. Moreover, it generates decomposable surface and intramuscular EMG, reproduces beta-band modulation of descending drive and its nonlinear transformation into force, and implements complete sensorimotor loops. Dimensionality reduction of simulated agonist-antagonist EMG reveals low-dimensional control manifolds consistent with experimental recordings from both healthy and spinal cord injured individuals. MyoGen provides physiologically grounded, ground-truth data and integrates seamlessly with analysis pipelines, enabling systematic investigation of motor control principles, validation of signal-processing algorithms, and exploration of sensorimotor interactions that are experimentally inaccessible.",

      "title": "Dorsal striatal dopamine integrates sensory and reward prediction errors to guide perceptual decisions",
      "content": "Perceptual decisions are shaped by expectations about sensory stimuli and rewards, learned through sensory and reward prediction errors. Dopamine is known to convey reward prediction errors that shape perceptual decisions. However, whether dopamine also signals sensory prediction errors during perceptual decision-making remains unknown. We recorded dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of mice performing a visual decision-making task while manipulating sensory and reward expectations. The two manipulations produced similar behavioral biases but elicited opposite dopamine signals, indicating that dopamine within the same striatal region encoded both sensory and reward prediction errors. Sensory prediction error signaling was specific to dopamine as striatal acetylcholine showed no such error signals. Optogenetically stimulating striatal dopamine at stimulus onset biased subsequent perceptual decisions, consistent with updating sensory expectations. A computational model learning from both sensory and reward prediction errors captured behavioral biases and dopamine data, revealing distinct but spatially overlapping dopaminergic teaching signals.",

      "title": "Versatile Learning without Synaptic Plasticity in a Spiking Neural Network",
      "content": "Learning in the brain's cerebral cortex is widely attributed to synaptic plasticity among cortical neurons. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that alternative processes, such as modulation of intrinsic excitability or gating by subcortical inputs, may also serve as important learning mechanisms. We developed the Bias Adaptive Neural Firing Framework (BANFF) as a simplified model of such phenomena embodied by a learnable bias current for each neuron of a rate-based network. Here, we extend this framework to spiking neural networks. We show that learning such biases enables one recurrent spiking neural network with fixed and random synaptic weights to perform well on nine tasks spanning classification, regression, and closed-loop dynamical systems mimicry. The network learnt a unique bias set for each task, and unlike recurrent synapse-based learning, new learning did not interfere with previous learning. The network was robust to non-stationary F-I curves (spike frequency adaptation), and biases could be learned with a learning algorithm (e-prop) that is more biologically plausible than stock gradient descent. Overall, we show that the BANFF can be extended from rate-based to spiking neural networks, maintaining good multi-task performance with a single network of spiking neurons.",

      "title": "Emergence of focal cortical hyperexcitability in the murine tetanus toxin epilepsy model",
      "content": "Focal epilepsies are a heterogeneous group of neurological disorders that may be caused by a large variety of underlying brain lesions. Long-term quality of life prognosis is often poor, and treatment options are limited. Despite significant progress in animal model sophistication over the past decades, a deeper understanding of epileptogenic processes on a mesoscale and microscale circuit level is needed. Here we model focal epileptogenesis in mice using single intracortical tetanus toxin injections and employ chronic in vivo two-photon and widefield calcium imaging with simultaneous EEG and behavioral video recordings (\"multimodal\" recordings) to follow epileptogenic changes over time. We observe a moderate increase in global brain excitability on EEG but, more strikingly, a gradual emergence of brief but intense optically recorded epileptiform events (\"microseizures\") that are spatially limited, peaking around 20-30 days after toxin injection and waning over the next 30 days. During these events, a majority of local neurons are recruited into extreme depolarization, yet there is considerable variability in duration and spatial coverage between events, depending on the proximity to the injection focus and the number of days elapsed since injection. Notably, EEG electrodes <3 mm from the focus typically fail to detect these events, highlighting the utility of high-resolution in vivo optical imaging for capturing all events in focal epileptogenesis. Single-cell patch clamp recordings in awake animals confirm that microseizure episodes are associated with depolarization block, during which the calcium signal remains high. Using chronic multimodal recordings, we detect an initial rise of interictal activity in local cortical networks during the first day after injection, followed by a layer-specific suppression and dysregulation of interictal spontaneous network activity in local cortical circuits preceding microseizure events, and low-level suppression when microseizures started subsiding. The chronic suppression in interictal activity is accompanied by relative hypoactivity of PV+ interneurons and concurrent hyperactivity of SOM+ interneurons. This integrated imaging-electrophysiology approach provides a powerful platform for unraveling circuit-level mechanisms of focal epilepsy and potentially for identifying and testing novel therapeutic strategies in the future.",

      "content": "The center surround structure of ganglion cells receptive fields is suited for edge detection, a first step towards image segmentation. However, in a dynamical visual scene with moving objects, it is less clear how the retina represents the boundaries of moving objects and therefore contributes to motion segmentation. Here, we show that the spatial selectivity of ganglion cells changes during their responses to a moving object. Specific cell types only respond to contrast changes near the edges of the moving object. Using a non-linear model to reproduce this result, we could isolate the mechanism responsible for this edge tracking behavior. Different types provide complementary representation of a moving object, some enhancing its boundaries, and may thus provide primitives for motion segmentation.",

      "title": "System-wide profiling reveals metabolic alterations in a G2019S LRRK2 knockin mouse model of Parkinson's disease: systemic depletion of pyrimidine nucleosides",
      "content": "Background: The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is the most common genetic cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with increased susceptibility to sporadic PD, which likely arises from the interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental exposure, and aging. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been implicated as an independent risk factor for PD, but the potential interaction between the G2019S LRRK2 mutation and metabolic stress in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We employed long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to induce metabolic syndrome in aged LRRK2 mutant mice, followed by system-wide characterization using multi-omic approaches, including metabolomic profiling, proteomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Results: We find that thymidine and deoxyuridine levels are consistently reduced across tissues in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice at baseline, accompanied by increased hepatic expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP). HFD exposure further unmasks disruptions in purine and energy metabolism in the brain and lungs of G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice, with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the ventral midbrain exhibiting the most pronounced impairment in oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional pathways. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that pre-existing metabolic syndrome unmasks widespread disruptions in systemic nucleotide and energy metabolism and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice. This conditional \"two-hit\" phenotype underscores the critical role of environmental factors, such as diet, in revealing metabolic vulnerabilities associated with PD-linked genetic backgrounds. Our study provides novel insight into potential metabolic targets or pathways for therapeutic intervention in individuals at-risk for developing PD.",

      "title": "The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) Modulates the Functional Output of Human Taste Bud Cells",
      "content": "We recently discovered that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR), which functions as a channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial surfaces, is expressed in both human and murine TBCs, but how it functions in these cells remains unknown. We postulated that CFTR may impact peripheral taste signaling at the level of taste receptor-expressing cells of the taste bud. To begin to test this hypothesis, we assessed how pharmacological manipulation of CFTR could affect the functional responses of human fungiform taste bud cells to prototypical taste stimuli (e.g., bitter, sweet, fat) using single cell calcium imaging and neurotransmitter (ATP) release measurements. We first established the presence of CFTR in these cells using immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR. We next found that CFTR inhibition generally increased stimulus-evoked calcium responses but that the specific response parameters impacted varied across different stimuli, likely due to differences in signal transduction mechanisms and the involvement of store-operated calcium channels. For example, response amplitudes to bitter and sweet stimuli were significantly enhanced with no changes in the proportion of cells responding to these stimuli whereas the opposite trends were observed with a fatty acid stimulus. Additionally, bitter-evoked neurotransmitter release was significantly enhanced by CFTR inhibition, suggesting that this effect is reflected throughout the signal transduction cascade. Ongoing and future experiments are utilizing shRNA knockdown as well as intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology to further interrogate the impacts of CFTR. In addition to human TBCs, we have detected CFTR in mouse taste tissues. Moreover, we have mined mouse TBC RNA sequencing datasets to determine CFTR co-expression patterns to inform future cellular and behavioral experiments in mice. Taken together, these data suggest that CFTR can modulate the signaling output of the taste bud.",

      "title": "Characterization of Lysine Methylation During Neuronal Differentiation of LUHMES cells.",
      "content": "Over one-third of human lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs)-the enzymes responsible for adding or removing methylation on lysine residues within proteins-are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Consequently, several studies have explored the roles of specific KMTs or KDMs in neuronal differentiation, and alterations in histone methylation patterns have been identified. It is now widely recognized that KMTs and KDMs also target non-histone proteins, yet knowledge of how non-histone lysine methylation changes during neuronal differentiation remains limited. Here, we address this gap using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify and measure changes in non-histone lysine methylation at three different stages in the Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) neuronal differentiation model. We identify 74 lysine methylation sites with significant differences in abundance across differentiation. Our analysis reveals lysine methylation on many non-histone proteins involved in neuronal differentiation and neurodevelopment, including signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, RNA splicing factors, and transcription factors. Overall, this work broadens the understanding of non-histone lysine methylation in a neuronal differentiation model and offers a valuable resource of lysine methylation sites on proteins of biological and clinical significance for future research.",
