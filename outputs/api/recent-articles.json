      "title": "Fatty Acid Pathways Regulate Thermal Nociception in Caenorhabditis elegans",
      "content": "Chronic pain remains a major unmet medical challenge, and lipid signaling pathways have emerged as key modulators of nociception. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a genetically tractable model, we investigated how fatty acid composition influences thermal avoidance behavior. Mutant strains lacking functional desaturase enzymes (elo-1, fat-1, fat-2, fat-3, fat-4, fat-6/fat-7), and consequently depleted in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as arachidonic acid, displayed significantly reduced sensitivity to noxious heat compared to wild-type animals. These findings indicate that intact PUFA biosynthesis is essential for normal thermal nociception in C. elegans. Given that arachidonic acid is a precursor of endocannabinoids (AEA and 2-AG) known to modulate TRPV1-dependent pain signaling, our results suggest that a conserved lipid-based mechanism regulates heat avoidance in nematodes. This study establishes a functional link between fatty acid metabolism and nociceptive behavior, providing a powerful platform to explore metabolic modulation of pain pathways.",

      "title": "Representational Similarity and Pattern Classification of Fifteen Emotional States Induced by Movie Clips and Text Scenarios",
      "content": "Theoretical models emphasize that categorical factors, dimensional factors, or their combination may define the semantic space organization of emotion representations. While recent behavioral work has applied innovative multivariate methods for testing these theories, neuroscientific assessments remain limited due to a focus on a small number of emotions, single theoretical perspectives, univariate methods, or small sample sizes. We overcame these limitations in a comprehensive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in which participants (N = 136) viewed 150 movie clips and 150 text scenarios that reliably induced 15 different emotional states spanning positive, negative, and neutral valence. For the movie inductions, representational similarity analysis yielded a correspondence between the categorical behavioral responses and the brain activity patterns, and partial least squares discriminant analysis achieved strong decoding performance for all 15 emotions from whole-brain fMRI data, with importance maps encompassing cortical, limbic, and subcortical regions. Classification error analyses and a Bayesian model comparison supported the categorical nature of the emotion representations relative to a 2-dimensional arousal-valence model. Hierarchical clustering of the representational dissimilarity matrices revealed that the 15 emotions were organized into similarly meaningful clusters at both the subjective and neural levels. Results from the scenario inductions, while demonstrating similar behavioral effects and behavioral hierarchical structures, were more difficult to decode from the fMRI data. Overall, these findings provide novel insights into how emotions are organized and represented in the human brain and evidence a relationship between our subjective experience of and brain responses to emotional inductions.",

      "title": "Mapping neural subspace dynamics onto the structure of the mouse descending motor system",
      "content": "The motor cortex supports various cognitive and motor functions. To prevent interference between these processes, the associated neural dynamics may be organized into orthogonal subspaces. In this subspace model, activity in a movement-null subspace encodes internal processes, while activity in a movement-potent subspace relates to movements. The biological implementation of this model, how activity in different subspaces map onto neural circuits, remains unclear. Particularly, it is unknown whether different cell types, with specific connectivity patterns, preferentially contribute to specific subspaces. Here, we test whether the cell type that directly links motor cortex to motor centers in the medulla and spinal cord, lower layer 5b extratelencephalic neurons (L-ETN), preferentially encodes activity contained in the movement-potent subspace. We performed cell-type-specific recordings in the motor cortex while mice performed a delayed-response licking task, and decomposed population activity into movement-null and movement-potent subspaces. We find that L-ETN activity spans both movement-null and movement-potent subspaces in a manner that could not be distinguished from the broader motor cortex population. Notably, downstream medullary circuits retain a subset of the movement-null dynamics contained in motor cortex, with select movement-null signals specifically filtered out. These results indicate that a distinct cortical output alone does not mediate the cancelation of movement-null dynamics; movement-null computations are instead distributed across the descending motor hierarchy.",

      "content": "Objects in motion follow predictable trajectories that the brain can easily anticipate. We investigated the underlying neural mechanisms, focusing on a form of representational momentum (RM), whereby the final state of a rotating object is misperceived along its future trajectory. Participants viewed two simultaneous streams of oriented gratings, one rotating predictably and the other random, and were instructed to attend to one of the two. Using EEG steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and decoding analysis, we found that attending to rotational sequences led to reduced neural response amplitude and systematic anticipatory shifts in the neural representation of orientation, relative to random sequences. These anticipatory biases emerged at early post-stimulus latencies and mirrored behavioral signatures of RM. Our findings suggest that the brain leverages internalized dynamics to form stable anticipatory representations with reduced neural activity strength.",

      "title": "Cycling on the Freeway: The perilous state of open-source neuroscience software",
      "content": "Most scientists need software to perform their research (Barker et al., 2020;Carver et al., 2022;Hettrick, 2014;Hettrick et al., 2014;Switters & Osimo, 2019), and neuroscientists are no exception. Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "In the oral cavity, oral stereognosis and chemesthesis refer to the abilities to recognize shapes and detect noxious substances, respectively, through various receptors distributed on the tongue. The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",

      "content": "In our day-to-day activities, we utilize not only the pads of our fingers but also the sides and hemispherical tips when manipulating objects. For teleoperation systems to replicate these real-life interactions, tactile sensation must be presented and distributed across the entire fingertip. Thus, understanding the distribution of tactile acuity at the fingertip is imperative. Although there is a general conception that the tactile acuity of the finger differs between the end of the finger and...",

Sensory substitution, achieved through tactile displays embedded in transfemoral prosthetic sockets, presents a promising non-invasive solution to provide artificial sensation to users. However, for this approach to be effective, users must accurately perceive distinct combinations of vibrations, a capacity limited by their...",

CVL is characterized by impaired visual acuity and contrast sensitivity while HFL is a loss of vision in the same half of the visual...",
