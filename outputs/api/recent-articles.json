      "title": "Sustained dynamics of saccadic inhibition and adaptive oculomotor responses during continuous exploration",
      "content": "In natural environments, stimuli often recur across time and space, requiring the visual system to remain sensitive to novelty while managing predictability. A central question in systems neuroscience is how motor systems adapt to repeated sensory events without compromising responsiveness. We investigated this adaptive capacity using saccadic inhibition (SI), a reflexive suppression of eye movements triggered by sudden visual transients, as a probe of oculomotor dynamics during naturalistic viewing. Human participants (N = 21) freely explored visual arrays while brief gaze-contingent flashes appeared five times at random intervals, either foveally or parafoveally. SI reliably occurred ~120 ms post-flash across repetitions and locations, indicating robust sensory-driven inhibition. However, the rebound phase, reflecting saccade reprogramming, showed a progressive decline. In a second experiment (N = 19), only the first or the fifth flash was visible on each trial. In this case, neither inhibition nor rebound was altered, suggesting that the rebound decline is driven by repeated sensory stimulation rather than exploration time. This dissociation reveals selective habituation of motor re-engagement mechanisms, while reflexive inhibitory gating remains stable. We propose that inhibition is mediated by circuitry that transiently suppresses saccade initiation and resists habituation. By contrast, the weakening rebound reflects a separate, habituation-prone route that reduces saccade generation to irrelevant events. Functionally, this imbalance implies a recalibration within the saccade generator, preserving inhibitory capacity while constraining motor output. Our findings uncover a distinct form of oculomotor habituation and demonstrate how SI reveals dynamic decoupling of sensory input and motor output under repeated stimulation.",

      "title": "Postpartum enhancement of spatial learning and cognitive flexibility: an IntelliCage study",
      "content": "The transition to motherhood has been shown to result in significant changes in the structure and function of the brain, with particular emphasis on the enhancement of cognitive abilities that are essential for survival. Specifically, in murine models, spatial learning and cognitive flexibility have been identified as critical components of mothering. These abilities facilitate efficient navigation of the environment, resource acquisition, and responsiveness to offspring's needs. While cognitive enhancements during the postpartum period have been observed in various experimental setups, research using long-term data collection with automated monitoring in home cage setup is completely lacking even though it provides a more reliable approach than other experimental procedures. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by systematically examining spatial learning and cognitive flexibility in female mice during the reproductive stages using IntelliCage, with the objective of offering a more comprehensive understanding of maternal cognitive adaptations. Utilising the IntelliCage system, we observed that female mice in the postpartum phase outperformed pregnant and nulliparous females in place learning, reversal learning, and fixed schedule drinking tasks, demonstrating faster adaptation and superior retention of information. These paradigms mirror real-world challenges faced by mothers, such as navigating resources and balancing caregiving with self-maintenance. The enhanced performance demonstrated by the mothers could be attributed to their heightened motivation and cognitive abilities, potentially influenced by substantial hormonal shifts, which have been known to modify neuroplasticity in critical brain regions. The identification of these improvements in maternal behaviour may offer novel insights into the impact of reproductive experiences on brain function, with implications for maternal health and broader cognitive research.",

      "title": "PRRT2 as an auxiliary regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation",
      "content": "During sustained activity, voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels enter a slow inactivation state to limit cellular hyperexcitability. Disruption of this regulatory process has been implicated in skeletal, cardiac and neurological disorders. While the kinetics of this process are well characterized, its endogenous modulators remain unclear. Here, we identify Proline-Rich Transmembrane Protein 2 (PRRT2) as a native regulator of Nav channel slow inactivation. We show that PRRT2 facilitates the entry of Nav channels into slow-inactivated state and delays their recovery, a regulatory effect conserved from zebrafish to humans. PRRT2 forms molecular complexes with Nav channels both in vitro and in vivo. In the mouse cortex, PRRT2 deficiency impairs the slow inactivation of Nav channels in neuronal axons, leading to reduced cortical resilience in response to hyperexcitable challenges. Together, these findings establish PRRT2 as a physiological modulator of Nav channel slow inactivation and reveal a mechanism that supports cortical resilience to pathological perturbations.",

      "title": "Mapping the Structural Brain Network of Psychopathy: Convergent Evidence from Humans and Chimpanzees",
      "content": "Psychopathy, a condition characterized by profound emotional and interpersonal deficits, has long been hypothesized to stem, in part, from structural brain abnormalities. Yet, neuroimaging findings remain inconsistent. To address these discrepancies, we applied a novel structural network mapping approach combined with cross-species analyses. Traditional meta-analysis revealed weak spatial convergence across 20 samples. Nevertheless, we found that heterogeneous peak locations coalesced into a distributed set of regions encompassing the insular, and prefrontal cortices. This network overlapped strikingly (r = .93) with a lesion-derived network causally linked to antisocial behaviour, and variation within it predicted volumetric risk scores in both humans (n = 107, R2 = .16) and chimpanzees (n = 148, R2 = .21). These findings suggest that psychopathy reflects abnormalities across a collection of distributed regions rather than isolated areas, providing a unifying explanation for decades of inconsistent results and advancing our understanding of its clinical, biological, and evolutionary bases.",

      "title": "Tmem117, an oligodendrocyte-enriched regulator of NCX activity, links myelin homeostasis to counterregulation and metabolic health.",
      "content": "The counterregulatory response (CRR) to hypoglycemia is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved homeostatic mechanism orchestrated by the central nervous system (CNS) to ensure survival during glucose scarcity. In individuals with diabetes, this response is frequently impaired, contributing to life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemia. Tmem117 was previously identified in a genetic screen as a promising hypothalamic regulator of CRR. Our previous work highlighted its contribution to CRR through regulation of vasopressin secretion. Here, we reveal that Tmem117 is also enriched in cells of the oligodendrocytic lineage and we characterize the contribution of oligodendrocytic Tmem117 in CRR. We show that depletion of Tmem117 from either all oligodendrocyte lineage cells or only mature oligodendrocytes leads to myelin deficits and male-specific defects in CRR. Furthermore, we reveal that transient, adult-onset depletion of Tmem117 in mature oligodendrocytes is sufficient to induce long-lasting metabolic imbalances in male mice, suggesting that defects in oligodendrocytes and myelin can affect peripheral glucose homeostasis. Mechanistically, we provide for the first-time insights on the function of Tmem117 showing that it regulates intracellular calcium dynamics through its interaction with the sodium-calcium exchanger NCX1. Together, these results redefine our understanding of the cellular contributors to the CRR, highlight the importance of oligodendrocytes in systemic glucose regulation, and position Tmem117 as a promising molecular target for cell-specific manipulation of NCX activity.",

Nonetheless, these findings should be interpreted with caution given the very low certainty of the evidence. These findings highlight the need for personalized screening intervals and early intervention strategies. Future research should focus on refining diagnostic criteria, integrating emerging biomarkers, and evaluating the impact of novel diabetes management technologies.",

The absence of standardized methods to assess oral somatosensory perception has led to a lack of consensus regarding the relationship between taste and trigeminal sensations. While some studies reported lower trigeminal perception in taste disorders, others did not confirm this correlation. To analyze...",
