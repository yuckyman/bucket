      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Triboelectric nanogenerators for neural data interpretation: bridging multi-sensing interfaces with neuromorphic and deep learning paradigms",
      "content": "The rapid growth of computational neuroscience and brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies require efficient, scalable, and biologically compatible approaches for neural data acquisition and interpretation. Traditional sensors and signal processing pipelines often struggle with the high dimensionality, temporal variability, and noise inherent in neural signals, particularly in elderly populations where continuous monitoring is essential. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as self-powered and flexible multi-sensing devices, offer a promising avenue for capturing neural-related biophysical signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and cardiorespiratory dynamics. Their low-power and wearable characteristics make them suitable for long-term health and neurocognitive monitoring. When combined with deep learning models\u2014including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and spiking neural networks (SNNs)\u2014TENG-generated signals can be efficiently decoded, enabling insights into neural states, cognitive functions, and disease progression. Furthermore, neuromorphic computing paradigms provide an energy-efficient and biologically inspired framework that naturally aligns with the event-driven characteristics of TENG outputs. This mini review highlights the convergence of TENG-based sensing, deep learning algorithms, and neuromorphic systems for neural data interpretation. We discuss recent progress, challenges, and future perspectives, with an emphasis on applications in computational neuroscience, neurorehabilitation, and elderly health care.",

      "content": "The brain is a highly diverse and heterogeneous network, yet the functional role of this neural heterogeneity remains largely unclear. Despite growing interest in neural heterogeneity, a comprehensive understanding of how it influences computation across different neural levels and learning methods is still lacking. In this work, we systematically examine the neural computation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) in three key sources of neural heterogeneity: external, network, and intrinsic heterogeneity. We evaluate their impact using three distinct learning methods, which can carry out tasks ranging from simple curve fitting to complex network reconstruction and real-world applications. Our results show that while different types of neural heterogeneity contribute in distinct ways, they consistently improve learning accuracy and robustness. These findings suggest that neural heterogeneity across multiple levels improves learning capacity and robustness of neural computation, and should be considered a core design principle in the optimization of SNNs.",

      "content": "IntroductionThis study aimed to investigate the effects of acupuncture and moxibustion, as well as various acupoints, on human autonomic nervous system (ANS) function and physical stress. The research further to identify effective intervention strategies for stress management and health maintenance.MethodsA Self-comparison design was conducted with healthy volunteers. Thirty-five volunteers received sequential 15-min interventions of moxibustion at ST36, acupuncture at CV12, and acupuncture at ST36, with a one-day washout period between interventions. Heart rate variability (HRV) was measured to assess autonomic function, and heart rate (HR) and the physical stress index (PSI) were measured to assess stress levels.ResultsCompared with the baseline, acupuncture at ST36 increased the high-frequency power (HF), root mean square of the successive interval difference (RMSSD), instantaneous standard deviation of the R\u2013R interval (SD1), long-term standard deviation of the R\u2013R intervals (SD2), total power (TP), and standard deviation of the normal\u2013normal interval (SDNN). Acupuncture at CV12 increased RMSSD, SD1, SD2, TP and SDNN, with sustained effects for RMSSD and SD1 post-acupuncture, SD1/SD2 were increased post-acupuncture. The HRs of all three interventions decreased during the intervention, and remained sustained effects post-intervention. The PSI decreased during acupuncture and the stimulation at CV12 remained sustained effects post-acupuncture.ConclusionAcupuncture alleviates physical stress by regulating ANS activity, with distinct modulatory effects observed across different acupoints, indicating potential applications in stress management and health maintenance. Moxibustion demonstrates marked efficacy in reducing HR.Clinical trial registrationhttps://itmctr.ccebtcm.org.cn/mgt/search, ITMCTR2025001289.",

      "title": "Unexpected words that become your best memories: How sentential constraint and word expectedness affect memory retrieval",
      "content": "Much is known about how the strength of contextual support from strongly constraining (SC) and weakly constraining (WC) sentences influences the online processing of expected (EXP) and unexpected (UNEXP) sentence-ending words. In the present study, we investigated the long-term mnemonic consequences associated with the processing of contextually constraint words and used event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the memory retrieval mechanisms at work. Furthermore, we investigated false memories for expected but unpresented words. If these unpresented words remained highly accessible in memory, their false recognition as familiar would manifest in a larger early frontal old/new effect, the putative ERP correlate of episodic familiarity. Behavioral results indicated that strongly expected and highly unexpected words were more likely to be recognized, whereas memory for moderately expected words was attenuated. However, the anticipated early frontal old/new effects in these conditions did not materialize. Instead, the retrieval of highly unexpected (SC-UNEXP) words was characterized by a late parietal old/new effect, reflecting a reliance on recollection-based processes. Unexpectedly, during retrieval SC-UNEXP words also evoked a late frontal positivity, a pattern usually associated with the inhibition of unpresented expected words during encoding. This suggests that the retrieval of these words reactivated inhibitory mechanisms akin to those activated during encoding. Additionally, expected lures that were correctly identified as new elicited a broadly distributed positive slow wave, indicative of recollective processing in support of a recall-to-reject strategy. This latter effect was observed irrespective of the predictive strength of the contextual support.",

      "content": "IntroductionAbandonment rates for myoelectric upper limb prostheses can reach 44%, negatively affecting quality of life and increasing the risk of injury due to compensatory movements. Traditional myoelectric prostheses rely on conventional signal processing for the detection and classification of movement intentions, whereas machine learning offers more robust and complex control through pattern recognition. However, the non-stationary nature of surface electromyogram signals and their day-to-day variations significantly degrade the classification performance of machine learning algorithms. Although single-session classification accuracies exceeding 99% have been reported for 8-class datasets, multisession accuracies typically decrease by 23% between morning and afternoon sessions. Retraining or adaptation can mitigate this accuracy loss.MethodsThis study evaluates three paradigms for retraining a machine learning-based classifier: confidence scores, nearest neighbour window assessment, and a novel signal-to-noise ratio-based approach.ResultsThe results show that all paradigms improve accuracy against no retraining, with the nearest neighbour and signal-to-noise ratio methods showing an average improvement 5% in accuracy over the confidence-based approach.DiscussionThe effectiveness of each paradigm is assessed based on intersession accuracy across 10 sessions recorded over 5 days using the NinaPro 6 dataset.",

      "title": "Show HN: Tusk Drift \u2013 Open-source tool for automating API tests",
      "content": "<p>Hey HN, I'm Marcel from Tusk. We\u2019re launching Tusk Drift, an open source tool that generates a full API test suite by recording and replaying live traffic.<p>How it works:<p>1. Records traces from live traffic (what gets captured)<p>2. Replays traces as API tests with mocked responses (how replay works)<p>3. Detects deviations between actual vs. expected output (what you get)<p>Unlike traditional mocking libraries, which require you to manually emulate how dependencies behave, Tusk Drift automatically records what these dependencies respond with based on actual user behavior and maintains recordings over time. The reason we built this is because of painful past experiences with brittle API test suites and regressions that would only be caught in prod.<p>Our SDK instruments your Node service, similar to OpenTelemetry. It captures all inbound requests and outbound calls like database queries, HTTP requests, and auth token generation. When Drift is triggered, it replays the inbound API call while intercepting outbound requests and serving them from recorded data. Drift\u2019s tests are therefore idempotent, side-effect free, and fast (typically <100 ms per test). Think of it as a unit test but for your API.<p>Our Cloud platform does the following automatically:<p>- Updates the test suite of recorded traces to maintain freshness<p>- Matches relevant Drift tests to your PR\u2019s changes when running tests in CI<p>- Surfaces unintended deviations, does root cause analysis, and suggests code fixes<p>We\u2019re excited to see this use case finally unlocked. The release of Claude Sonnet 4.5 and similar coding models have made it possible to go from failing test to root cause reliably. Also, the ability to do accurate test matching and deviation classification means running a tool like this in CI no longer contributes to poor DevEx (imagine the time otherwise spent reviewing test results).<p>Limitations:<p>- You can specify PII redaction rules but there is no default mode for this at the moment. I recommend first enabling Drift on dev/staging, adding transforms (<a href=\"https://docs.usetusk.ai/api-tests/pii-redaction/basic-concepts\">https://docs.usetusk.ai/api-tests/pii-redaction/basic-concep...</a>), and monitoring for a week before enabling on prod.<p>- Expect a 1-2% throughput overhead. Transforms result in a 1.0% increase in tail latency when a small number of transforms are registered; its impact scales linearly with the number of transforms registered.<p>- Currently only supports Node backends. Python SDK is coming next.<p>- Instrumentation limited to the following packages (more to come): <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-sdk?tab=readme-ov-fil...</a><p>Let me know if you have questions or feedback.<p>Demo repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Use-Tusk/drift-node-demo</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45887536\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45887536</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "<p>Hi all, I\u2019ve been working on this project for a while but haven't shared it properly on Hacker News.<p>What is it?<p>It is a casual gaming platform focused on simple multiplayer games that can be played in person with a central screen (like a TV) or remotely via video chat. You can also play on your smart Android based TVs via the app: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gametje\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gametje</a> (it was just released recently so could be buggy). It is also available directly in Discord: <a href=\"https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1215323000866607125\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.com/discovery/applications/12153230008666071...</a> as an embedded activity.<p>It is playable in 9 languages and doesn\u2019t require any downloads. Most games revolve around creativity in some shape or form. They can be played by just about anyone whether or not you consider yourself a \u201cgamer\u201d. If you can text, you can play these games.<p>Why did I create it?<p>Some of you may see the resemblance to Jackbox games. I have been a huge fan of them for 10+ years and enjoyed playing their games a lot. However, I found their support for other languages a bit lacking. While living in the Netherlands, I have encountered quite a few non-native English speakers and wanted to help them have a similar experience. Jackbox also has some fragmentation issues between app stores. I own their games on PC and PS4 but I can\u2019t share a \u201clicense\u201d between them. They also come out with a pack every year with 5 games. You never know if the game(s) will be fun, or if you should try to buy a previous pack with the one killer party game in it.<p>I designed Gametje with these issues in mind. It is playable in multiple languages with more being added regularly (feel free to request one). You can play it from any device with a web browser. There is no need to install it via Steam or a game console. All games are available in one place with no \u201cpacks\u201d to buy.<p>What\u2019s up with the name?<p>I have been living in the Netherlands for some years and part of my original motivation stems from wanting to give my friends here a game to play in their native language. It's way easier to be witty/funny in your mother tongue after all! Because of that, I wanted to incorporate something Dutch into the site's name. The suffix \u2018-tje\u2019 is one of the diminutive endings in Dutch and is meant to soften a word or make it \"smaller\". Game + tje = Gametje, or a little game. I have been informed by native Dutch speakers that it should have been \u2018Gamepje\u2019 to be \"correct\" but I liked the way Gametje sounded better.<p>Where can I try it?<p>Go here: <a href=\"https://gametje.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gametje.com/</a><p>You can test it out as a guest without signing up in order to get a feel for the games. Clicking into each game gives a short explanation and a small example of the gameplay. When creating a game room, you can choose to host via a central screen, host and play from a single device (like a phone) or cast the main screen to a Chromecast. There is also an Android TV app available that was just recently released: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gametje\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gametje</a><p>After creating a game room, you can join from another browser window or device. You can also add AI players if you want to try it out on your own, although it is a lot more fun with real people. I also created a discord channel: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/7jrftHuHp9\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://discord.gg/7jrftHuHp9</a> where you can find other users to play with. If you sign up for an account, you can opt-in as an alpha tester and see the new games as they are developed. It\u2019ll also keep track of all your previous games and make sure not to duplicate content. You can review previous games as well and relish in your past victories.<p>What am I looking for?<p>I am interested in feedback about the whole concept and also the gameplay. Is it fun? What could be improved? Interested in helping out? Let me know!<p>Happy to share the more technical details as well for those that are interested. You can also read a bit about the platform and games in my blog:<p><a href=\"https://blog.gametje.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.gametje.com/</a><p>Thanks!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45887709\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45887709</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",
