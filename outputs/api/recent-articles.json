      "content": "IntroductionAccurate and early identification of brain tumors is essential for improving therapeutic planning and clinical outcomes. Manual segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Computational models that combine Artificial Intelligence and biomedical imaging offer a pathway toward objective and efficient tumor delineation. The present study introduces a deep learning framework designed to enhance brain tumor segmentation performance.MethodsA comprehensive ensemble architecture was developed by integrating Generative Autoencoders with Attention Mechanisms (GAME), Convolutional Neural Networks, and attention-augmented U-Net segmentation modules. The dataset comprised 5,880 MRI images sourced from the BraTS 2023 benchmark distribution accessed via Kaggle, partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets. Preprocessing included intensity normalization, augmentation, and unsupervised feature extraction. Tumor segmentation employed an attention-based U-Net, while tumor classification utilized a CNN coupled with Transformer-style self-attention. The Generative Autoencoder performed unsupervised representation learning to refine feature separability and enhance robustness to MRI variability.ResultsThe proposed framework achieved notable performance improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. The segmentation module produced a Dice Coefficient of 0.85 and a Jaccard Index of 0.78. The classification component yielded an accuracy of 87.18 percent, sensitivity of 88.3 percent, specificity of 86.5 percent, and an AUC-ROC of 0.91. The combined use of generative modeling, attention mechanisms, and ensemble learning improved tumor localization, boundary delineation, and false positive suppression compared with conventional architectures.DiscussionThe findings indicate that enriched representation learning and attention-driven feature refinement substantially elevate segmentation accuracy on heterogeneous MRI data. The integration of unsupervised learning within the pipeline supported improved generalization across variable imaging conditions. The demonstrated performance suggests strong potential for clinical utility, although broader validation across external datasets is recommended to further substantiate generalizability.",

      "title": "High-Fidelity Tuning of Olfactory Mixture Distances in the Perceptual Space of Smell Through a Community Effort",
      "content": "A central goal in sensory science is to establish quantitative mappings between physical stimuli and perceptual responses. While such mappings are well characterized in vision and audition, they remain poorly defined in olfaction, limiting progress toward understanding the representations of smell. Predicting perceptual similarity between odor mixtures offers a promising route to formalize these relationships. To advance this effort, the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Olfactory Mixtures Prediction Challenge assembled a curated, cross-study dataset describing the similarity of 507 mixture pairs and an unpublished test set of 46 mixture pairs. Teams competed to predict the perceptual similarity of mixture pairs, and then collaborated post-challenge to create an ensemble combining top-performing models that notably improves predictions over the existing state-of-the-art models. Moreover, ensemble model maintains high predictive accuracy in novel validation set. Our model provides a reproducible framework for neuroscientists, chemists, and engineers to compare odor mixtures and provides a foundation for future efforts towards better understanding the olfactory properties of mixtures.",

      "title": "From labels to latents: revealing state-dependent hippocampal computations with Jump Latent Variable Model",
      "content": "Neural activity is usually interpreted by imposing external labels (e.g., stimuli or position during locomotion) and decoding within that space (e.g. replay). While powerful, such supervision can mask structure in the data that do not correspond to the label. Unsupervised methods, in turn, often assume smooth latent dynamics and miss genuine discontinuities. We introduce a conceptually simple, computationally efficient latent variable model that infers both (i) the latent variables organizing population activity and (ii) whether their dynamics are continuous or fragmented in time. Fitting reduces to an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure that alternates two operations familiar to systems neuroscience--tuning-curve estimation and label decoding--without requiring external labels. Applied to rodent hippocampal spike recordings, the model reveals distinct population patterns at the same physical position that supervised spatial decoding fails to detect. While learned latents exhibit place-field-like tuning, their reactivation patterns are better distinguished by behavioral states. The model further identifies a continuity-fragmentation axis that characterizes population activities across sleep-wake brain states that is modulated by cholinergic inputs. By not relying on externally imposed spatial labels, our approach exposes structure that supervised approaches obscure and provides a powerful tool for datasets lacking behavioral tracking.",

      "title": "Whole-brain connectomics of Drosophila reveals a robust, distributed architecture for the suppression of feeding during escape",
      "content": "Survival demands instant prioritization of escape over maintenance. To decode the dynamic logic embedded in the static Drosophila connectome (FlyWire v783), we simulated the conflict between predator-evasion, feeding, and grooming to uncover the logic of this switch. We show that escape is a holistic state defined by distributed robustness: it is reliably triggered by only a fraction of visual inputs (LC4/LPLC2) and induces a system-wide pause on behaviors like feeding and grooming. Within this global suppression, we identify a specialized, fail-safe architecture for arresting feeding. A redundant ensemble of neurons (DNge031/CB0565) targets the premotor center Roundup, effectively disfacilitating motor output. Crucially, this inhibition is modular, anatomically distinct from grooming suppression, and relies on additive logic to ensure suppression even if individual components fail. Our results demonstrate how connectome topology implements robust, survival-critical control through distributed neural architecture.",

      "content": "Navigation in the real world may rely on a multitude of different strategies with distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, the characterization of spontaneous strategy use during wayfinding and underlying neural correlates are scarce. We explore data across three groups of participants who performed a virtual navigation task: (I) epilepsy patients undergoing invasive electrophysiological recordings of the hippocampus, and two groups who underwent fMRI scanning: (II) young adults at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (APOE-e4 carriers) and (III) healthy controls. We establish three metrics by which to quantitatively characterize each taken path, with the aim of simultaneously reflecting the putative strategies used by humans to solve the task: 1. straightness of paths; 2. deviation towards the edge of the circular arena; and 3. overlap of individual paths leading to a specific object location, which putatively relate to reliance on allocentric (1) and egocentric reference frames (2 & 3). Extracted metrics were related to performance in the task and to hippocampal activity. We find that strategy use is variable within participant, changes across the experiment, and is adaptive in a group-dependent manner. While hippocampal BOLD activity and theta (gamma) power were generally inversely (positively) related, we found that the recruitment of the hippocampus was both group- and strategy- specific. Our results further our understanding of the heterogeneous and idiosyncratic nature of spatial navigation by revealing how these behaviors are altered by disease and the subsequent compensatory neural dynamics, as well as the link between mesoscopic and macroscopic neural signals.",

      "title": "Non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation modulates Pavlovian bias in a state-dependent manner",
      "content": "The vagus nerve transmits vital signals between organ systems of the body and the brain. Despite growing interest in non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) for treatments of various disorders, it is not known whether its modulatory effects on behavior are dependent on bodily states. Here, we used a single-blind randomized crossover design with two within-participant factors, stimulation (right tVNS vs. sham) and metabolic state (water vs. caloric load), to investigate 54 healthy participants (210 sessions). To evaluate state-dependent changes in reinforcement learning, we used a valenced go/no-go task. Performance on this task can be used to estimate a Pavlovian choice bias, which captures improved performance for valence-congruent actions (e.g., go to win rewards) versus valence-incongruent actions (e.g., no-go to win rewards) and has been associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. In line with theorized state-dependency of tVNS-induced changes, we observed that tVNS decreased Pavlovian response biases (Go x Win) after the caloric load (Stimulation x Load: p = .038). Taking into account individual changes in hunger but not satiety ratings best captured behavioral modulation, indicating that this modulatory effect could be driven by motivational effects related to metabolic interoception (sensed \"need\"). We conclude that right tVNS decreases Pavlovian response biases if the body is in a postprandial, but not a fasting state. Since fasting and Pavlovian biases have been previously associated with elevated dopamine neurotransmission, our results call for additional research on state-dependent motivational effects of tVNS to optimize interventions.",

      "title": "Cognitive state dependent enhancement of cognitive control with transcranial magnetic stimulation",
      "content": "Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet variability of therapeutic responses remains high. A key contributor to this variability may be state-dependent effects of brain stimulation, where activity in underlying circuits can shape the propagation of TMS-evoked activity. Thus, pushing target circuits into a desired state by engaging cognition may sensitise those circuits to TMS-evoked plasticity. We tested whether TMS effects on cognitive control, a transdiagnostic construct implicated across psychiatric disorders and a putative mediator of TMS efficacy, are state-dependent. Participants (N = 25) completed a context-dependent behavioural assay of cognitive control before and after we delivered rTMS to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). During rTMS, participants performed either the cognitive control task (active-state TMS), or performed a context-independent perceptual task (control-state TMS). We assessed changes in downstream behavioural metrics of circuit function, as well as neural indices of cognitive control measured from electroencephalography (EEG). rTMS enhanced cognitive control performance only when PFC-anchored control circuits were actively engaged during stimulation. Similarly, only active-state TMS modulated theta band oscillatory activity, which is thought to be a marker of cognitive control engagement. Moreover, modulation of those EEG indices by TMS predicted gains in behavioural performance in the cognitive control task. These findings demonstrate that TMS effects on cognitive control are state-dependent, in which endogenous engagement of PFC-anchored networks can shape the magnitude and functional relevance of TMS-induced plasticity. Considering cognitive states during TMS may therefore offer a framework to enhance and/or accelerate TMS therapeutic effects.",

      "title": "Effects of height-induced postural threat on static and dynamic balance performance in healthy individuals: a systematic review with meta-analysis",
      "content": "BackgroundHeight-induced postural threat, such as standing or walking at elevation, elicits fear-related adaptations in balance control. Understanding these adaptations is crucial for interpreting motor behavior under anxiety and for informing rehabilitation and fall-prevention interventions. However, no previous systematic review with meta-analysis has quantified how height exposure influences balance performance.ObjectiveThe objective was to aggregate, characterize, and quantify the effects of height-related postural threat on static and dynamic balance performance.MethodsA systematic literature search in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus was conducted from their inception date until 15 September 2025. Eligible cross-sectional studies compared ground-level (no threat) versus elevated (threat) conditions in healthy participants. Static balance outcomes during upright stance included sway amplitude and frequency; dynamic balance outcomes while walking included gait velocity. Included studies were coded for gender, age, postural threat conditions, balance assessment/outcome, and test modality. Methodological study quality/design and risk of bias was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies. Heterogeneity was quantified using I2 statistics, and sensitivity was evaluated via Leave-One-Out method. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated and analyses were stratified by age group (i.e., children, young adults, older adults).ResultsThe search identified a total of N\u202f=\u202f438 records, and 25 of them (involving a total of 877 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Concerning static balance (18 studies, 44 comparisons), postural threat resulted in small-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f0.20) decreases in sway amplitude measures and in large-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.06) increases in sway frequency measures, indicating a potentially protective \u201cstiffening\u201d response. However, children did not use the \u201cstiffening\u201d response when standing at height (sway amplitude: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.41; sway frequency: SMD\u202f=\u202f\u22120.04). Regarding dynamic balance (7 studies, 16 comparisons), postural threat led to large-sized (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.33) declines in gait velocity, and this was more pronounced for conditions with a high (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.78) than a low (SMD\u202f=\u202f1.05) difficulty level.ConclusionHeight-induced postural threat evoked functional changes in static (i.e., decrease/increase in sway amplitude/frequency measures) and dynamic (i.e., decrease in walking speed measures) postural control. For static balance this is indicative of an effective \u201cstiffening\u201d response which is apparently not yet developed in children. For the dynamic balance, the further decrease in gait velocity during difficult walking conditions at height implies a compensatory mechanism to increase stability. Despite consistent direction and magnitude of effects, substantial between-study heterogeneity limits the generalizability of these findings, and results should therefore be interpreted with caution.",

      "content": "Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technology enables direct communication between the human brain and external devices by decoding electroencephalography (EEG)signals into actionable commands. As a noninvasive and portable modality, EEG-based BCIs hold promise for applications ranging from neurorehabilitation to assistive technologies. However, their performance depends critically on the accurate extraction of relevant neural features and the reliable recognition of underlying patterns. Deep learning has transformed this process. By automatically learning complex, task-relevant representations from raw or minimally processed EEG data, deep neural networks have surpassed many traditional handcrafted feature approaches in both accuracy and adaptability. Yet, the substantial computational and memory demands of many deep learning architectures limit their deployment in portable or real-time BCI systems. This challenge has motivated a growing interest in lightweight models-architectures optimized to reduce complexity while preserving or even enhancing performance. This paper provides a systematic review of such lightweight deep learning models for EEG signal classification. To organize this landscape, existing approaches are categorized into three main strategies: (1) information integration strategies based on multi-scale feature fusion, (2) hidden layer optimization strategies, and (3) hybrid improvement strategies based on structural optimization. The review synthesizes recent advances, identifies emerging trends, and outlines potential directions for future research. These insights aim to inform the design of efficient and robust EEG classification architectures capable of meeting the practical demands of real-world BCI applications.",

      "title": "Evaluating the clinical readiness of artificial intelligence in EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis",
      "content": "Objective. Automated electroencephalography (EEG)-based epilepsy diagnosis has reported near-perfect accuracies for almost two decades on a benchmark dataset, yet virtually no system is used in routine care. We critically re-examined this translation gap by reproducing five widely cited Artificial Intelligence (AI) models spanning statistical feature extraction, classical machine-learning and deep-learning paradigms, and assessed their ability to generalise from the benchmark dataset to a newly curated, clinically verified scalp-EEG cohort. Approach. All models were implemented as originally described and trained with ten-fold cross-validation on the benchmark dataset. External validation was performed on our independently curated dataset made publicly available, comprising 30 subjects (15 epilepsy, 15 healthy) recorded with 19-channel scalp EEG under standard clinical protocols. We further examined the influence of subject-level data leakage by contrasting performance when training/testing samples overlapped with those when completely independent patient partitions were enforced. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of ROC (with 95% Confidence Intervals) were the primary metrics. Main results. When transferred unchanged to the external cohort, overall accuracy fell from 94% on the benchmark dataset to 42%\u201353%, with sensitivities as low as 0.97% for the deep convolutional neural network and specificities dropping to 4% for time-frequency methods. Permitting subject overlap artificially elevated accuracy to 59%\u201396%, whereas strict patient separation reduced it to 41%\u201353% in 95% Confidence Interval. Deep-learning models exhibited the steepest decline, confirming over-fitting to subject-specific artefacts. Statistical feature\u2013based approaches, though less affected, still under-performed clinically acceptable thresholds. Significance. Our results expose key translational barriers in AI for EEG-based epilepsy diagnosis\u2013data leakage, acquisition bias, and overfitting to patient idiosyncrasies\u2013leading to severe performance erosion on clinical data. Rigorous patient-independent validation, transparent reporting (aligned with CARE principles), and well-curated multi-channel scalp-EEG datasets are essential to ensure clinically dependable AI tools for epilepsy diagnosis.",
