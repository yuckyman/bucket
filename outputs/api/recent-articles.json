      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

      "title": "The Role of Pavlovian Bias in Smoking Cessation Success and Neurocognitive Alterations During Nicotine Withdrawal",
      "content": "Background: Inability to manage conflicts between multiple decision-making systems is associated with various mental disorders including addiction. The imbalance between the Pavlovian and instrumental systems may contribute to smoking cessation failure and relapse, as excessive Pavlovian motivation may override goal-directed quitting attempts. However, the exact role of the Pavlovian bias in smoking cessation and its neurocognitive mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: Eighty-six smokers participated in a smoking cessation clinic, completing the well-established orthogonalized go-nogo task before and after the intervention. We applied computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analyses to investigate the role of Pavlovian bias and its neural correlates in predicting smoking cessation outcomes. Results: Computational modeling revealed that higher levels of Pavlovian bias were associated with treatment failures. Importantly, Pavlovian bias significantly moderated the relationship between clinic participation rate and the likelihood of smoking cessation, suggesting that such bias can undermine motivational effort to quit. Furthermore, individuals who successfully quit smoking exhibited increased Pavlovian bias toward reward following cessation, indicating a potential cognitive mechanism underlying the relapse cycle. Complementary fMRI analyses demonstrated that Pavlovian bias influenced valence encoding in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), suggesting altered decision-making neural circuits. Conclusions: Pavlovian bias can be a critical risk factor of relapse in the smoking population, while this bias can be increased in response to nicotine abstinence. Moreover, the results highlight the roles of the vmPFC in decision-making under Pavlovian-instrumental conflict, providing insights into the neural underpinnings of relapse vulnerability. Understanding these mechanisms may guide targeted interventions to enhance smoking cessation outcomes.",

      "title": "Hedonic hotspot in rat olfactory tubercle: map for mu-opioid, orexin, and muscimol enhancement of sucrose 'liking'.",
      "content": "Pleasure plays a crucial role in positive reinforcement and motivation. Brain regions able to amplify positive hedonic reactions to sweetness, known as 'hedonic hotspots', are distributed within the mesocorticolimbic reward systems. The olfactory tubercle (OT), a part of the ventral striatum that receives olfactory input, contains distinct functional domains: the anteromedial domain mediates approach motivation toward odors associated with food, whereas the lateral domain mediates avoidance motivation away from odors associated with danger. However, it has remained unclear whether the OT modulates hedonic reactions to pleasant sensations. In this study, we made pharmacological microinjections in OT of in rats to examine whether these OT subregions can modulate hedonic reactions, as assessed by the taste reactivity test. Sweet oral infusions of sucrose solution were delivered into the mouth via an intraoral cannula, and the rats' orofacial and somatic hedonic reactions were recorded and analyzed. We compared three pharmacological agents: mu-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO, orexin-A peptide, and GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. Microinjection of any of these drugs into the anteromedial OT subregion enhanced hedonic 'liking' reactions to sucrose. Furthermore, DAMGO injection into the anteromedial OT subregion recruited distant Fos expression in other 'hedonic hotspots', including in the caudal ventral pallidum and the rostromedial orbitofrontal cortex. By contrast, the same microinjections into the anterolateral OT subregion failed to enhance 'liking' reactions and, DAMGO oppositely increased aversive 'disgust' reactions. These findings suggest that the anteromedial OT contains a 'hedonic hotspot', whereas the anterolateral OT may contain a suppressive opioid 'hedonic coldspot'. Thus, OT subregions may help causally modulate hedonic reactions to sweetness and flavor perception.",

      "title": "Human assembloid model of emergent neurotropic enteroviruses",
      "content": "Enteroviruses (EVs) are the leading cause of viral meningitis in children. Recent outbreaks of non-polio EVs, most notably EV-A71 and EV-D68, have been associated with a polio-like paralysis known as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). The lack of relevant models that mimic the cellular and functional responses of these human-restricted pathogens has hampered the development of effective treatments. We have previously engineered human stem cell-derived assembloids that recapitulate the neuromuscular connections underlying muscle contractions by integrating human spinal cord/hindbrain organoids (hSpO) and human skeletal muscle. Here, we used organoids and assembloids to investigate polio and non-polio EV pathogenesis. Infection of assembloids with poliovirus (PV), EV-D68 and EV-A71 resulted in loss of muscle contraction for all three viruses, which could be prevented by treatment with an antiviral agent. Yet, despite the convergence on neuronal dysfunction, the cellular targets by which each virus acted differed. More specifically, single cell transcriptomic profiling uncovered divergent cell tropisms between the EVs, and live imaging experiments revealed different modes and kinetics of cell damage. Altogether, we describe a multi-cellular model that captures viral pathogenesis in a human and circuit-relevant context.",

      "title": "CNS Myelin Sheath Lengths Locally Scale to Axon Diameter via Piezo1",
      "content": "Myelin sheath lengths vary by an order of magnitude in the central nervous system (CNS) and tune the timing of neuronal signaling. Thus, variation in myelin sheath length has been proposed to coordinate the timing of neuronal signaling to ultimately impact behavior. The mechanisms to establish myelin sheath length are unknown. For decades, reports have documented that in vivo myelin sheath size scales with the diameter of the ensheathed axon. We previously demonstrated diameter is sufficient to instruct myelin sheath lengths formed by oligodendrocytes using a synthetic axon culture system. The mechanisms of oligodendrocyte diameter-sensing and its translation into sheath elongation are still unknown. Here we demonstrate that diameter-sensing and sheath length is locally regulated: each individual myelin sheath responds to the underlying fiber diameter. We uncover a novel mechanism for scaling myelin sheath length to fiber diameter, through mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In vivo, Piezo1 impacts the elongation of myelin sheaths on large diameter axons, recapitulating our in vitro results. Yet, surprisingly, there is no impact on myelin thickness with conditional Piezo1 loss. We propose Piezo1 provides a mechanism to establish hard-wired myelin sheath patterns, where oligodendrocytes transduce axon diameter into generating myelin segments with vastly different lengths.",

      "title": "Scalable Human Cellular Models of Parkinson Disease Reveal A Druggable Link Between the Angiotensin Receptor 1 and Alpha-Synuclein Pathology",
      "content": "Background: Parkinson s disease (PD) involves progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra. No disease-modifying treatments exist, only symptomatic relief. Our lab reported an unbiased screen in larval zebrafish identifying renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, including clinically used AGTR1 inhibitors for hypertension, as potent neuroprotective agents. This study aims to investigate the effects of AGTR1 inhibition on human mDA neuron survival using inducible neurodegenerative 2D and 3D models for human mDA neuron degeneration. Methods: We report a scalable high-content platform, using CRISPR-engineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived mDA neurons expressing a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) fluorescent reporter, allowing to track mDA neuron survival live in a dish. We developed chemically inducible neurodegenerative 2D and 3D models for human mDA neuron degeneration, allowing to recapitulate PD pathology in human cells in vitro. Results: Our model establishes scalable human cellular models of PD well-suited for therapeutic discovery. Using 2D and 3D mono and co-cultures, this study demonstrates that inhibition of AGTR1, via chemical or genetic means, protects against chemically induced mDA neuron degeneration. Transcriptomic analyses show AGTR1 inhibition lowers synuclein transcription, by reducing SNCA and SNCB gene expression. In 3D neuron-glia assembloids, AGTR1 inhibition protects against the accumulation of phosphorylated form of a-synuclein (p129a Syn), key PD pathological marker. Conclusions: We highlight AGTR1 as a key regulator of -synuclein transcription and aggregation in human mDA neurons, and AGTR1 inhibition as pro-survival in human iPSC-derived models. These findings position inhibition of AGTR1 as a promising therapeutic strategy for PD neuroprotection.",
