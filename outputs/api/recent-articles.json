      "title": "A fast and simple algorithm for accurate spike detection in HD-MEA recordings",
      "content": "Background: High density microelectrode arrays provide a strong platform to study individual neuronal activity and neuronal network dynamics. However, the analysis of high volume and complex data present several challenges. Common spike detection methods based on Root-Mean-Square (RMS) threshold crossing underestimate the number of spikes during neuronal bursting, which frequently occurs in neuronal cultures. In addition, the detection of action potentials by multiple electrodes makes spikes sorting a computationally expensive task. New Method: We optimized a previously described detection method, based on the scaled median of absolute deviations (MED) that is more accurate during high rates of neuronal firing. In addition, we added a step to de-duplicate (DP) spikes recorded on multiple electrodes, which enhanced the accuracy of MED. The combined method of detection and de-duplication (DP-MED) is less computationally expensive and easier to implement than popular sorting alternatives like Kilosort-4. Results and Conclusions: During burst periods, the MED-based method detected over half of spikes that were undetected by the RMS-based method. To evaluate the performance of DP-MED, we simulated data that emulates neuronal activity recorded with HD-MEA. Across increasing firing rates, DP-MED shows more precision than Kilosort-4 but is slightly less accurate. After inducing high firing rate in cortical cultures with pharmacological stimulation, DP-MED detected a similar number of spikes than Kilosort-4, however, the analysis in Kilosort-4 was 40-fold more time-consuming. These results highlight the effectiveness of the DP-MED method in the context of drug screening using HD-MEAs.",

      "title": "A neuronal pathway for the supraspinal relay of warm and cool sensation",
      "content": "Cutaneous thermosensation is a fundamental sense allowing discrimination of external temperature changes and driving adaptive responses essential for survival and well-being. This sensory process begins with the activation of peripheral thermoreceptors, which encode the quality and intensity of thermal stimuli into neuronal activity that is further integrated by spinal cord circuits and relayed to supraspinal centres through the anterolateral tract (ALT). While classical experiments identified thermal responsive ALT neurons in the superficial spinal dorsal horn, the functional logic of innocuous temperature relay remains poorly understood. We show that, in mice, the majority of Phox2a-lineage lamina I ALT are selectively tuned to innocuous warming or cooling, and receive direct inputs from peripheral thermoreceptors. Their genetic ablation, chemogenetic or optogenetic manipulation impaired temperature discrimination. Our findings contrast with the previous finding that the majority of ALT neurons being mechano- and thermo-nociceptive and provide novel evidence for the existence of a large ensemble of genetically defined warming- and cooling- responsive ALT neurons. The large representation of innocuous temperature in supraspinal-relaying ALT neurons indicates substantial spinal amplification of thermal information and underscores the importance of innocuous thermosensation in the ascending sensory pathway.",

      "title": "Comparative effect of vortioxetine and sertraline on clinical and inflammatory profile in Parkinson\u2019s disease with comorbid depression",
      "content": "BackgroundPreclinical and clinical studies suggest that the multimodal antidepressant vortioxetine may offer a valuable therapeutic option in the treatment of depression associated with neurological disorders, including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD).ObjectivesTo compare the effect of vortioxetine and the SSRI sertraline in the treatment of PD and comorbid depression, placing emphasis on peripheral inflammation markers.MethodsThis is an observational longitudinal study. We have recruited 33 patients affected by PD with comorbid depression, evaluated for motor and non-motor symptoms, depression, and peripheral and soluble markers of inflammation at baseline and at the end of antidepressant treatment. Patients were divided into two groups treated with either vortioxetine (10\u201320\u202fmg/day) or sertraline (50\u202fmg/day) for 4\u202fmonths. A group of 12 healthy controls was also used for comparative purposes.ResultsAt baseline PD patients showed a higher number of \u201cclassical\u201d monocytes and a lower number of \u201cnon-classical\u201d monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). The number and activity of DCs generated from isolated monocytes were also lower in PD patients. While both sertraline and vortioxetine treatment further reduced the number of mDCs, only vortioxetine had a restorative effect on CD40- and CD54-expressing DCs and their function. Both drugs display an antidepressant activity, but vortioxetine was superior to sertraline in improving cognitive function, anxiety, anhedonia, and apathy.ConclusionThese data evaluate for the first time the immunomodulatory effects of two different treatments in PD patients with comorbid depression, highlighting the greater immunomodulatory capacity of vortioxetine.",
