      "title": "VibTac: A High-Resolution High-Bandwidth Tactile Sensing Finger for Multi-Modal Perception in Robotic Manipulation",
      "content": "Tactile sensing is pivotal for enhancing robot manipulation abilities by providing crucial feedback for localized information. However, existing sensors often lack the necessary resolution and bandwidth required for intricate tasks. To address this gap, we introduce VibTac, a novel multi-modal tactile sensing finger designed to offer high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing simultaneously. VibTac seamlessly integrates vision-based and vibration-based tactile sensing modes to achieve high-resolution and high-bandwidth tactile sensing respectively, leveraging a streamlined human-inspired design for versatility in tasks. This paper outlines the key design elements of VibTac and its fabrication methods, highlighting the significance of the Elastomer Gel Pad (EGP) in its sensing mechanism. The sensor's multi-modal performance is validated through 3D reconstruction and spectral analysis to discern tactile stimuli effectively. In experimental trials, VibTac demonstrates its efficacy by achieving over 90% accuracy in insertion tasks involving objects emitting distinct sounds, such as ethernet connectors. Leveraging vision-based tactile sensing for object localization and employing a deep learning model for \u201cclick\u201d sound classification, VibTac showcases its robustness in real-world scenarios.",

      "title": "Age-Related Impact in Illusory Torque Cues Induced by Asymmetric Vibrations",
      "content": "Illusory pulling sensations in the translational or rotational direction are induced by asymmetric vibrations applied to the fingertips. Although previous studies have discussed the involvement of mechanoreceptors associated with skin deformation and spatial processing in the parietal association cortex in the generation of illusory cues, the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to indirectly estimate the contribution of mechanoreceptors to the perception of illusory pulling torque cues by examining the relationship between vibration thresholds and the properties of these illusions, leveraging the known decline in cutaneous sensation sensitivity associated with aging (N = 40). Our results revealed an age-related increase in vibration thresholds, which is consistent with previous research. While male participants showed consistent sensitivity to illusory pulling cues across age groups, female participants exhibited a decline in sensitivity with age. Moreover, we observed only weak or no correlations between the vibration thresholds and the sensitivity of the illusory pulling cue. Although we were unable to identify any findings that explain the contribution of mechanoreceptors, we discovered a gender difference in the sensitivity to induced illusions among older individuals. These findings offer valuable insights for elucidating the mechanism underlying the illusion.",

      "title": "Network Activity Shapes Inhibitory Synaptic Development in the Mouse Hippocampus",
      "content": "<p>The proper development of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance is critical for brain function, as any imbalance has been associated with myriad neuropsychiatric disorders. How this balance evolves during synaptic development remains unclear. To address this question, we examine how manipulations of signal-regulatory protein &alpha; (SIRP&alpha;), a cell adhesion molecule that organizes excitatory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus, affect inhibitory synaptogenesis to maintain E/I balance, using mice of either sex. SIRP&alpha; primarily localizes to excitatory synapses. Overexpression or inactivation of SIRP&alpha; in a single neuron in hippocampal cultures affects excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses formed onto the SIRP&alpha;-manipulated neuron, indicating that SIRP&alpha; is an excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapse organizer. Despite this, bath application of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain increases inhibitory synapses in culture, and global inactivation of SIRP&alpha; during critical periods functionally decreases both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus. By using various conditional knock-out mice, we found that SIRP&alpha; from pyramidal neurons, but not from interneurons, astrocytes, or microglia, is necessary for proper inhibitory synapse development. Interestingly, inactivation of SIRP&alpha; from most pyramidal neurons is necessary to impact inhibitory synaptic development, suggesting that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the hippocampus is driven by the strength of excitation in the pyramidal&ndash;neuron network, and not by a change in excitatory input to a single cell. Consistently, the effect of SIRP&alpha;'s ectodomain on inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptogenesis is blocked by global neural activity inhibition. We propose that the development of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is regulated by network-level excitatory activity to evolve E/I balance.</p>",
