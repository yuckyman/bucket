      "content": "Advancements in methodologies for efficient large-scale acquisition of high-resolution serial microscopy image data have opened new possibilities for experimental studies of cellular and subcellular features across whole brains in animal models. There is a high demand for open-source software and workflows for automated or semi-automated analysis of such data, facilitating anatomical, functional, and molecular mapping in healthy and diseased brains. These studies share a common need to consistently identify, visualize, and quantify the location of observations within anatomically defined regions, ensuring reproducible interpretation of anatomical locations, and thereby allowing meaningful comparisons of results across multiple independent studies. Addressing this need, we have developed a suite of desktop and web-applications for registration of serial brain section images to three-dimensional brain reference atlases (QuickNII, VisuAlign, WebAlign, WebWarp, and DeepSlice) and for performing data analysis in a spatial context provided by an atlas (Nutil, QCAlign, SeriesZoom, LocaliZoom, and MeshView). The software can be utilized in various combinations, creating customized analytical pipelines suited to specific research needs. The web-applications are integrated in the EBRAINS research infrastructure and coupled to the EBRAINS data platform, establishing the foundation for an online analytical workbench. We here present our software ecosystem, exemplify its use by the research community, and discuss possible directions for future developments.",

      "content": "In recent years, advances in microscopy and the development of novel fluorescent probes have significantly improved neuronal imaging. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are characterized by alterations in neuronal arborization, neuronal loss\u2014as seen in Parkinson\u2019s disease\u2014or synaptic loss, as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders can also impact dendritic spine morphogenesis, as observed in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. In this review, we provide an overview of the various labeling and microscopy techniques available to visualize neuronal structure, including dendritic spines and synapses. Particular attention is given to available fluorescent probes, recent technological advances in super-resolution microscopy (SIM, STED, STORM, MINFLUX), and segmentation methods. Aimed at biologists, this review presents both classical segmentation approaches and recent tools based on deep learning methods, with the goal of remaining accessible to readers without programming expertise.",

      "title": "Brain atrophy and cholinergic denervation in progressive supranuclear palsy: an MRI and [18F]-FEOBV PET study",
      "content": "IntroductionProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide spectrum of motor and cognitive impairments. Structural brain imaging biomarkers, such as the Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index 2.0 (MRPI 2.0), are increasingly recognized as means of supporting a PSP diagnosis. These anatomic measures lack neurobiological correlates. In the present work, we investigated whether structural brain changes captured by MRPI 2.0 associate with whole-brain and regional cholinergic nerve terminal deficits in PSP.MethodsStructural magnetic resonance (MR) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) [18F]-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18F]-FEOBV) PET imaging was obtained in a sample of 16 PSP subjects. MRPI 2.0 index was quantified and correlated with whole brain VAChT binding using statistical parametric mapping (SPM), after adjustment for sex, dopaminergic medication dose and disease duration. Post hoc multiple regression analyses were performed to correlate regional mean VAChT binding with MRPI 2.0 (after adjusting for the same covariates), characterizing the proportion of variance in cholinergic terminal deficits explained by this structural index.ResultsVoxel-wise SPM analyses revealed that MRPI 2.0 is significantly associated with cholinergic nerve terminal loss in brainstem, especially pontomesencephalic, limbic structures, insula, basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellar regions. Post hoc multiple regression analysis demonstrated that MRPI 2.0 accounts for about half of the variance in cholinergic nerve terminal integrity within relevant brain structures in PSP, showing the most robust association in the thalamus.DiscussionStructural brain changes associated with higher MRPI 2.0 index scores may be a reliable proxy measure of cholinergic terminal deficits in PSP, predominantly those in subcortical regions. Differential association of subcortical brain region cholinergic deficits with PSP-specific structural brain changes may reflect the characteristic pattern of 4R-tau pathology observed in PSP.",
