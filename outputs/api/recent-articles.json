      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "Neurobehavioral concomitants of alcohol use in older healthy adults",
      "content": "Few laboratory studies permitting granular analyses of alcohol use on neurobehavioral processes in older adults have been reported. This study, reporting baseline data from an on-going longitudinal project, seeks to address this gap. Toward that end, working memory (WM) processes were targeted using the continuous recognition version of the Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST). Healthy male and female drinkers aged 65\u201380 years completed self-report measures of substance use, negative affect and demographics prior to testing. Drinking patterns were quantified on the basis of typical standard drinks/day (D/D). Behavioral data were obtained in a two-button forced choice paradigm. Neurophysiological data were obtained for each stimulus presentation with analyses focusing on a mid-frontal negative shift occurring \u223c 300\u2013500 ms post stimulus (FN400) and a posterior positive shift occurring \u223c 550\u2013800 ms after stimulus presentation (LPC). To constrain the models, for the behavioral analyses correlations between D/D, measures of negative affect, stimulus condition (\u201cnew,\u201d \u201cidentical,\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d) and performance were conducted. They indicated that only accuracy in labeling \u201cnew\u201d items was related to D/D. Subsequent least squares regression revealed that D/D was inversely related to accuracy for new items. In a sensitivity analysis removing THC users, the D/D effect was retained. Correlations incorporating mean amplitudes for the FN400 and LPC failed to reveal identifiable patterns. Consequently, separate mixed models (e.g., stimulus condition) for FN400 and LPC were conducted. D/D was not predictive of the FN400 for any stimulus condition. It was negatively related to the LPC mean amplitude. In post-hoc analyses, the effect was most notable for \u201cnew\u201d stimuli. After removing THC users, the magnitude and direction of the D/D effect was retained, although the p value fell short of significance. Primary models failed to reveal sex main or interaction effects. However, exploratory post-hoc analyses justify their continued study. These data lend preliminary support for the hypothesis that sustained drinking among older adults may negatively impact neurobehavioral processes. They are also consistent with expectations that alcohol effects may be modest and constrained by specific process. Importantly, these outcomes will be expanded through on-going longitudinal study, extending investigation to study of alcohol-related cognitive decline.",

      "title": "A computational framework combining neuronal dynamics and evolutionary game theory for network-level synaptic interactions",
      "content": "Objective. In this study, we present a novel computational framework that combines the Hindmarsh\u2013Rose (HR) neuronal model with evolutionary game theory on networks to simulate and interpret synaptic-level interactions within neuronal populations. Our approach preserves the features of the HR model\u2014capable of generating both spiking and bursting dynamics\u2014while integrating game-theoretic principles that govern the balance between emulative and non-emulative behaviors across neurons. Approach. Neurons were modeled as strategic agents whose interactions evolve according to game-theoretic principles, allowing us to capture emergent network dynamics beyond classical electrophysiological analyses. A key innovation of our work is the formulation of a parameter estimation method based on adaptive observers, which enables the recovery of game-theoretic parameters solely from partial state observations. The proposed framework is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating its ability to recover hidden parameters and accurately predict system behavior under diverse conditions. Main results. By applying the devised approach to synthetic datasets mimicking real electrophysiological recordings, we highlight its applicability in distinguishing neuronal populations based on their strategic interactions. In this context, the model is shown to faithfully reproduce both spiking and bursting behaviors, capturing the diverse electrophysiological patterns observed in in vitro experimental settings. Furthermore, we explore the potential of this model in experimental data analysis by suggesting that the estimated parameters may serve as discriminative markers for different neuronal types and structural characteristics. Significance. The integration of dynamical systems theory, game-theoretic modeling, and adaptive estimation provides a robust quantitative tool for investigating complex neuronal network dynamics. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of the method in parameter estimation, reinforcing its value for systematic analysis of synaptic interactions and advancing our understanding of neuronal network dynamics.",
