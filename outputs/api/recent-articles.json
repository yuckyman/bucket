      "title": "Adaptive-expert-weight-based load balance scheme for dynamic routing of MoE",
      "content": "Load imbalance is a major performance bottleneck in training mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, as unbalanced expert loads can lead to routing collapse. Most existing approaches address this issue by introducing auxiliary loss functions to balance the load; however, the hyperparameters within these loss functions often need to be tuned for different tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of activated experts tends to exacerbate load imbalance, while fixing the activation count can reduce the model\u2019s confidence in handling difficult tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a dynamically balanced routing strategy that employs a threshold-based dynamic routing algorithm. After each routing step, the method adjusts expert weights to influence the load distribution in the subsequent routing. Unlike loss-function-based balancing methods, our approach operates directly at the routing level, avoiding gradient perturbations that could degrade model quality, while dynamically routing to make more efficient use of computational resources. Experiments on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves accuracy comparable to top-2 routing, while significantly reducing the load standard deviation (e.g., from 12.25 to 1.18 on MNLI). In addition, threshold-based dynamic expert activation reduces model parameters and provides a new perspective for mitigating load imbalance among experts.",

      "content": "Accurate pedestrian tracking and behavior recognition are essential for intelligent surveillance, smart transportation, and human-computer interaction systems. This paper introduces TSLNet, a Hierarchical Multi-Head Attention-Enabled Two-Stream LSTM Network, designed to overcome challenges such as environmental variability, high-density crowds, and diverse pedestrian movements in real-world video data. TSLNet combines a Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network (Two-Stream CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to effectively capture spatial and temporal features. The addition of a Multi-Head Attention mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant features in complex environments, while Hierarchical Classifiers within a Multi-Task Learning framework enable the simultaneous recognition of basic and complex behaviors. Experimental results on multiple public and proprietary datasets demonstrate that TSLNet significantly outperforms existing baseline models, achieving higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) in behavior recognition, as well as superior Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) and ID F1 Score (IDF1) in pedestrian tracking. These improvements highlight TSLNet\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing tracking and recognition performance.",

The only real options are joining Discord, or watching markdown commits on GitHub, neither of which is ideal for everyone.</p>\n<p>To help make things easier, the following two changelog sites have been built.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://changes.fmhy.bid/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://changes.fmhy.bid/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers changes that occur in both the #Recently-Added and #Monthly-Update channels in our Discord.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://fmhy-tracker.pages.dev/</a></strong></p>\n<p>This covers links that have been added, updated, or removed by watching GitHub for changes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note that we will also continue to make the monthly posts same as always, and you can still follow updates by joining our <a href=\"https://redd.it/17f8msf\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a>, or watching the <a href=\"https://github.com/fmhy/edit/commits/main/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Commits Page</a> on GitHub yourself.</p>\n<p>We hope you guys like them, if you have any suggestions or questions feel free to let us know.</p>",

      "title": "Brain-wide Organization of Post-Synaptic Sites: Three Principles",
      "content": "Synapses are fundamental units of neural computation and structural plasticity in the brain, yet their brain-wide spatial organization in mammals remains largely unknown. Building on our previous mapping and modeling of dendritic spines and axonal boutons, we developed a statistical approach to generate over 17.99 million predicted post-synaptic sites based on the potential arbor contacts (PPSSPAC) across the dendritic arbors of 155,743 neurons spanning the entire mouse brain. By analyzing the topological features of these sites, we identified three key organizational principles. First, PPSSPAC exhibits a distinct region-specific spatial pattern at the dendritic branch level, preferentially enriching near the distal ends of dendritic segments, in contrast to the valley-like distribution of pre-synaptic sites along axonal branches. Cross-species validation against independent electron microscopy datasets from mouse and human brains, revealed a conserved and previously unquantified pattern of synaptic organization. Second, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC effectively captures variations across cell types in the hippocampus, enabling neuron classification based on synaptic architecture. This serves as a complementary mesoscale descriptor to existing classifications based on global neuronal connectivity (source-target relationships) or local dendritic microenvironments. Third, the spatial distribution of PPSSPAC, rather than synapse density, shows remarkable correlation with independent whole-brain electrophysiological activity. The spatial organization of PPSSPAC also correlates with several gene expression datasets. These results suggest the post-synaptic pattern could be mediator linking molecular signatures, neural dynamics, and connectivity types of cells. Our study reveals, for the first time, a structural substrate for hierarchical information processing in the brain, providing new insights into neural computation and a foundation for brain digital twin models to support next-generation AI infrastructure.",
