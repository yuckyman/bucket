      "title": "Augmented Feedback Training for Overcoming the Learning Plateau of Motor Expertise",
      "content": "Skilled performers often encounter a plateau in which further practice yields little improvement of intricate sensorimotor skills. Overcoming such limits requires novel training paradigms that can engage performers in novel ways of exploring and refining their actions. Here, we introduce a training pipeline that integrates high-precision motion sensing with augmented feedback to enhance expert-level motor learning. Using piano performance as a model, trained pianists practiced imitating a prize-winning expert's performance of a technically demanding movement sequence. While conventional auditory-based learning offered limited benefit, augmenting practice with trial-by-trial visualizations of discrepancies between the pianist's own movements and those of the expert enabled learners to refine their performance. This training induced richer movement exploration, facilitated closer convergence toward expert motion patterns, and produced perceptible improvements in sound quality evaluated by professional pianists. These findings demonstrate that augmented feedback can break performance plateaus in experts by providing externally-sensed, task-specific information that expands exploration beyond habitual training strategies. Such augmented learning promises new applications across domains where expertise is constrained by entrenched motor habits, including musical performance, athletics, and surgical training.",

      "title": "Molecular Characterization of Parabrachial Neurons in Xenopus laevis and Silurana tropicalis: Evolutionary Conservation and Sex-Specific Differences",
      "content": "Clawed frogs communicate acoustically to coordinate reproduction, with males producing species-specific advertisement calls to attract females. In Xenopus laevis, males generate fast trills composed of clicks repeated at 60 Hz, a feature absent in both Silurana tropicalis males and X. laevis females, whose calls consist of slower click rates (30 Hz and 7 Hz, respectively). In male X. laevis, fast trills are generated by premotor neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), known as Fast Trill Neurons (FTNs). We hypothesized that FTNs are unique in male X. laevis, and either absent or molecularly distinct in clawed frogs that do not produce fast trills. To test this, we used constellation pharmacology to profile receptor expression of neurons via intracellular Ca2+; responses to pharmacological agents in PBN neurons from male X. laevis, male S. tropicalis, and female X. laevis. Surprisingly, we found putative FTNs in all three groups, including those that do not produce fast trills. Furthermore, a similar proportion of FTNs across groups expressed fast-kinetic voltage-gated potassium channels known to support rapid firing, indicating that the presence of these channels does not correlate with the ability to produce fast trills. Instead, some of these channels were more prevalent in males of both species compared to female X. laevis, suggesting a potential sex-specific, non-vocal function. The discovery of FTNs with similar molecular profiles in non-fast-trilling individuals suggests that these neurons are conserved across species and sexes, and may serve other functions. In male X. laevis, FTNs may have been repurposed for fast trill production during speciation. These findings provide new insight into understanding how neural circuits evolve and diversify across species and sexes.",

      "title": "Seasonal plasticity in neuroendocrine mechanisms relevant to year-round territorial aggression in a wild teleost fish",
      "content": "Animals experience cyclical environmental changes, such as seasons, that require physiological adjustments to support different behaviors. Although many behaviors occur only during specific periods, some species, like Gymnotus omarorum, display territorial aggression year-round, making them valuable models to study seasonal plasticity in the mechanisms maintaining stable behavioral outputs. G. omarorum is a teleost fish in which neuroestrogens have been shown to play a key role in non-breeding aggression. Here, we quantified circulating hormone levels and gene expression in the social behavior network of wild breeding and non-breeding individuals. During the non-breeding season, both sexes exhibited elevated circulating androgen levels, providing potential substrates for local estrogen synthesis. Consistently, brain aromatase and estrogen receptor expression were also upregulated, suggesting an increased capacity for local estrogen synthesis and signaling. Our findings provide the first evidence in a teleost of seasonal plasticity in the mechanisms underlying territorial aggression. Comparisons with birds and mammals reveal both shared and lineage-specific strategies, highlighting common endocrine principles while revealing the evolutionary diversity of solutions to maintain a stable behavioral phenotype across changing seasonal contexts.",

      "content": "In this work, we introduce a method for mapping the spatial entropy of functional brain network community structure images in brain space. Entropy maps indicate the extent to which the network communities present in a local area are ordered or disordered. We demonstrate how spatial entropy can be quantified for each voxel in the brain according to the network community affiliations of surrounding voxels. This process results in interpretable maps of brain network entropy. We show that local entropy decreases in predictable brain regions during working memory and music-listening tasks. We suggest that these regional entropy reductions reflect self-organization of neural processes in support of functionally localized cognitive tasks. Analyses in this work provide a framework for future analyses of spatial entropy in complex networks that can be mapped to Euclidean space, both within the brain and in other contexts.",

      "title": "Mediodorsal Thalamic Input to Striatum Contributes to Early Action Learning",
      "content": "<p>Action control is hypothesized to be mediated by corticothalamo-basal ganglia loops subserving the acquisition and updating of action contingencies. Within this, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is thought to contribute to volitional control over behavior largely through its interactions with prefrontal cortex. However, MD also projects into striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the contribution of such projections to behavioral control is not known. Using a mouse model of volitional action control in either sex, here we find that MD terminal calcium activity in dorsal medial striatum (MD-&gt;DMS) represents action information during initial acquisition of a novel action contingency. This representation of action information decreases with continued experience. Data demonstrate MD-&gt;DMS activity is necessary to learn and employ a contingency control over actions. Functional attenuation of MD-&gt;DMS activity negated normal exploration, instead biasing repetitive action control, and resulted in mice unable to adapt their initial action strategy upon changes in action contingency. This suggests MD supports plasticity underlying initial action strategy learning used to adjust control given changing contingencies. Overall, these data show that MD projections into striatum contribute to volitional action control that supports acquisition of adaptive behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Trans-synaptic Interaction with mGluR6 Contributes to ELFN1 Presynaptic Enrichment in Rod Photoreceptors",
      "content": "<p>At the glutamatergic synapses between rod photoreceptors and ON-type bipolar cells (BCs), neurotransmitter is detected by the postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR6. This receptor forms trans-synaptic interactions with ELFN1, a presynaptic cell adhesion molecule expressed in rods, and ELFN1 is important for mGluR6 localization at BC dendritic tips. Here, we show that in mice of either sex lacking mGluR6, the presynaptic localization of ELFN1 is disrupted. In rods of mGluR6 null mice, ELFN1 is still restricted to the axon terminal spherules but is only partially colocalized with synapses. The ELFN1 localization defect is rescued by expressing mGluR6-EGFP in ON-BCs. In vitro binding experiments demonstrated that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and LRR C-terminal cap (LRRCT) regions of the ELFN1 extracellular domain (ECD) are necessary and sufficient for binding to all of the Group 3 mGluRs, including mGluR6. ELFN1-flag expressed in rods of wild-type mice is correctly localized at presynapses, colocalizing with the postsynaptic marker TRPM1 in the outer plexiform layer. Deletion of the LRRCT domain abolished trafficking of ELFN1-flag to rod spherules, whereas deletion of other parts of the ELFN1 ECD did not prevent axonal trafficking or correct presynaptic localization. Our results demonstrate bidirectional mutual regulation of presynaptic enrichment of ELFN1 and postsynaptic enrichment of mGluR6 at photoreceptor synapses.</p>",

      "content": "<p>The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) integrates subcortical signals related to arousal, stress, addiction, and anxiety with top-down cortical influences. Increases or decreases in PVT activity exert profound, long-lasting effects on behavior related to motivation, addiction, and homeostasis. Yet the sources of its subcortical excitatory and inhibitory afferents, their distribution within the PVT, and their integration with layer-specific cortical inputs remain unclear. Using transgenic male and female mice selective for GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, or for different cortical layers, we found that the input organization of PVT is unique among thalamic nuclei. PVT received subcortical GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs from multiple, distinct hypothalamic and brainstem regions. Most regions provided either excitatory or inhibitory afferents; however, subcortical inputs with dual components have also been found. Most of these subcortical inputs selectively targeted the core region of the PVT that contained large number of densely packed calretinin-positive (CR+) neurons. Cortical afferents to PVT displayed layer-specific segregation. Layer 5 neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex preferentially innervated the CR+ core, whereas layer 6 input was more abundant in the transition zone between PVT and the mediodorsal nucleus. These findings demonstrate extensive convergence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs from diverse subcortical sources, selectively, in a sharply delineated CR+ core region of PVT which is also under strong top-down control from layer 5. This unique organization may explain why the CR+ PVT core serves as a critical bottleneck in the subcortex&ndash;cortex communication involved in affective behavior.</p>",

      "title": "Using noise to distinguish between system and observer effects in multimodal neuroimaging",
      "content": "IntroductionIt has become increasingly common to record brain activity simultaneously at more than one spatiotemporal scale. Here, we address a central question raised by such cross-scale datasets: do they reflect the same underlying dynamics observed in different ways, or different dynamics observed in the same way? In other words, to what extent can variation between modalities be attributed to system-level versus observer-level effects? System-level effects reflect genuine differences in neural dynamics at the resolution sampled by each device. Observer-level effects, by contrast, reflect artefactual differences introduced by the nonlinear transformations each device imposes on the signal. We demonstrate that noise, when incorporated into generative models, can help disentangle these two sources of variation.MethodsWe apply this noise-based approach to simultaneously recorded high-frequency broadband signals from macroelectrodes and microwires in the human hippocampus.ResultsMost subjects show a complex mixture of system- and observer-level contributions to their time series. However, in one subject, the cross-scale difference is statistically attributable to an observer-level effect\u2014i.e., consistent with the same dynamics at both microwire and macroelectrode scales.DiscussionThis study shows that noise can be used in empirical datasets to determine whether cross-scale variation arises from differences in neural dynamics or differences in observer functions.",

However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",
