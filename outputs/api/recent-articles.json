      "title": "Coarse-graining reveals collective predictive information in a sensory population",
      "content": "Biological systems perform complex computations using hundreds of individual actors, but they do so efficiently and in a way that can be read out and interpreted by other biological networks. Coarse-graining may allow for key collective features to be effectively and efficiently communicated. In the brain, early sensory systems perform prediction, which can compensate for lags in neural processing. This computation is collective, meaning it relies upon interactions between many neurons, and operates in complex, dynamic natural environments. Taking these two facets of biological complexity together, we search for maximally-predictive collective variables in large groups of retinal ganglion cells responding to dynamic natural visual scenes. To find collective variables that best capture predictive computations in the neurons, we apply a tractable, approximate implementation of the information bottleneck method to neural data. We infer a lower-dimensional representation that is maximally informative about the future neural activity. We observe scaling relationships between this mutual information estimate, neural subset size, and information decay timescale. Further, the structure of collective modes changes for predicting at short versus longer timescales.",

      "title": "Topological decoding of grid cell activity via path lifting to covering spaces",
      "content": "High-dimensional neural activity often reside in a low-dimensional subspace, referred to as neural manifolds. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex provide a periodic spatial code that are organized near a toroidal manifold, independent of the spatial environment. Due to the periodic nature of its code, it is unclear how the brain utilizes the toroidal manifold to understand its state in a spatial environment. We introduce a novel framework that decodes spatial information from grid cell activity using topology. Our approach uses topological data analysis to extract toroidal coordinates from grid cell population activity and employs path-lifting to reconstruct trajectories in physical space. The reconstructed paths differ from the original by an affine transformation. We validated the method on both continuous attractor network simulations and experimental recordings of grid cells, demonstrating that local trajectories can be reliably reconstructed from a single grid cell module without external position information or training data. These results suggest that co-modular grid cells contain sufficient information for path integration and suggest a potential computational mechanism for spatial navigation.",

      "title": "CASPR facilitates clearance of degenerating axons by Schwann cells and macrophages after peripheral nerve injury",
      "content": "In the peripheral nervous system (PNS) debris of injured axons is efficiently removed by Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages (Mphs) - a process which is vital for nerve regeneration. Molecular so-called eat-me signals, mediating axon-SC/axon-Mph crosstalk and debris clearance after injury are just at the beginning of being identified. Herein, we describe the axonal node protein contactin-associated protein (CASPR) as a potential novel signal for axonal debris removal in peripheral nerve injury. In healthy nerves, CASPR is restricted to Ranvier's nodes interacting with glia-derived partner proteins to assure saltatory action potential propagation. In injured murine and human nerves, we describe upregulation and re-localization of CASPR protein along the axons. Enhanced CASPR presence after injury appears to involve local axonal translation rather than transcriptional regulation. Of note, CASPR overexpression in murine central and peripheral neurons in vitro has a growth inhibitory effect. More importantly, axonal debris deriving from injured nerves - and hence having increased CASPR content - are phagocytosed more efficiently than debris of healthy nerves. Interfering with CASPR by function-blocking antibodies strongly reduces axonal debris uptake. This finding demonstrates a functional relevance of CASPR as a potential eat me signal in this process.",

      "content": "Mapping the developmental landscape of brain function is a key objective in modern neuroscience, greatly advanced by the public release of neuroimaging datasets. Here, we utilized movie-watching fMRI to study brain entropy (BEN) in 3-12-year-olds from OpenNeuro. The results of the analysis revealed that decreasing BEN within the action-mode network (AMN) serves as a key developmental marker in children. The AMN underpins goal-directed cognition, and its entropy reduction may signify a crucial shift from early, externally driven sensorimotor processing toward the emergence of more internalized, self-referential thought processes associated with the default-mode network. These findings highlight BEN as a powerful and sensitive tool for deciphering the principles of functional brain development.",

      "title": "Butyrate rescues chlorpyrifos-induced social deficits through inhibition of class I histone deacetylases",
      "content": "Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used organophosphate pesticide effective through inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, which leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine and continuous nerve stimulation. In addition to its well-known acute toxicity, exposure to CPF has also been linked to chronic conditions such as an increasing risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and adverse effects on gut health, including disturbances to the gut microbiome and metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism of CPF's contribution to ASD remains unclear, and the roles of the gut microbiome and gut metabolites in CPF-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity remain elusive. Using a high-throughput social behavior assay, we found that embryonic exposure to CPF induced lasting social deficits in zebrafish. Through a small-scale screen of common health beneficial gut microbiome metabolites, we discovered that butyrate effectively rescued CPF-induced social deficits. RNA sequencing of zebrafish brain tissues revealed that early exposure to CPF induced a lasting suppression of neuronal genes, including many ASD risk genes, and elevated expression of circadian genes. Butyrate partially reversed the suppression of key neuronal genes. Butyrate is a non-selective inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Through a series of loss-of-function experiments utilizing CRISPR-Cas9-induced knockouts and selective chemical inhibitors, we found that the class I HDAC, HDAC1, most likely mediates butyrate's rescue effect. Metabolomics analysis detected changes in several nitrogen metabolism-related pathways in the zebrafish gut following CPF exposure. Metagenomics analysis revealed an increase in abundance of the denitrifying bacteria Pseudomonas and a reduction in the nitric oxide-sensitive bacteria Aeromonas in the CPF-exposed zebrafish gut microbiome. Our results connect CPF-exposure with changes in the gut microbiome, metabolome, epigenetics, gene expression, and behavior, inspiring a novel hypothesis for the underlying molecular mechanisms of CPF-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity. In the long run, our findings may help elucidate how CPF exposure contributes to autism risk and inspire therapeutic developments.",

      "content": "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is...",

      "content": "For a number of years, facial features removal techniques such as 'defacing', 'skull stripping' and 'face masking/blurring', were considered adequate privacy preserving tools to openly share brain images. Scientifically, these measures were already a compromise between data protection requirements and research impact of such data. Now, recent advances in machine learning and deep learning that indicate an increased possibility of re-identifiability from defaced neuroimages, have increased the...",

Whether we work with reaction times, electrophysiological signals, or magnetic resonance imaging data, we rely on software to acquire, analyze, and statistically evaluate the raw data we obtain-or to generate such data if we work with simulations. In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",
