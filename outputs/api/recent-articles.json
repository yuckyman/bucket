      "title": "Deep learning approaches for EEG-based healthcare applications: a comprehensive review",
      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a longstanding means of non-invasively recording brain signals and has become highly valuable for the study of neurological and cognitive processes. Recent progress in deep learning has also greatly improved both EEG signal analysis and interpretation, making more accurate, reliable and scalable solutions in various healthcare applications. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the convergence of EEG and deep learning, with an emphasis on diagnostic of neurological disorders, brain recovery, mental health conditions, and brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. We methodically investigate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) models, transformer models and hybrid architectures for EEG-based tasks. Key challenges that have been hampering emerging solutions are critically covered, namely signal-related variability, the lack of data, and deep learning model limited interpretability. Finally, we highlight emerging trends, open issues and promising research directions, with the aim of laying a solid ground toward the improvement of EEG-based healthcare applications and to drive future research in this fast-growing research area.",

      "title": "Randomized prenatal and postnatal nutrient supplementation shows no long-term impact on cortical gray matter in Ghanaian children",
      "content": "IntroductionMaternal and child undernutrition are linked to atypical brain development in children. Provision of pre- and post-natal small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) has been shown to positively impact children\u2019s growth and development. It is unknown, however, whether SQ-LNS affects child brain morphology.MethodsThe present study used data from the International Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements randomized controlled trial in Ghana. Participants were 231 children (Mage = 10.6 years; 49.4% female) exposed to maternal iron and folic acid supplements prenatally (n = 113, control group) or maternal SQ-LNS prenatally until 6 mo postpartum and child SQ-LNS from age 6 to 18 months (n = 118, SQ-LNS group). Children underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain anatomy. Primary outcomes were total gray matter volume, cortical gray matter thickness, and cortical gray matter volume assessed with whole-brain analyses. Secondary outcomes were thickness and volume of a priori specified cortical and subcortical regions assessed with region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Basic and full covariate models were tested and corrected for multiple comparisons.ResultsWhole-brain analyses revealed no significant differences between groups in total gray matter volume or cortical gray matter thickness or volume. Cortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater right caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) thickness [mean (95%CI): 2.78 (2.73, 2.84) vs. 2.72 (2.67, 2.77); effect size = 0.21] and reduced left rostral ACC volume [2575.1 (2477.3, 2672.8) vs. 2678.74 (2568.7, 2788.8); effect size = 0.18]. Subcortical ROI analyses showed the SQ-LNS versus control group had greater volume of the left pallidus [1794.45 (1759.10, 1829.80) vs. 1726.13 (1685.05, 1767.21); effect size = 0.33] and right nucleus accumbens [751.54 (729.83, 773.24) vs. 705.73 (684.21, 727.24); effect size = 0.39]. Significant group differences did not hold after correction for multiple comparisons.DiscussionIn this cohort, pre- and post-natal SQ-LNS supplementation did not significantly alter total or cortical gray matter thickness and volume at 10 years, though secondary ROI analyses indicated subtle, non-robust differences in selected regions.",

      "title": "MicroRNA profiling in post-mortem spinal cord of C9ORF72-related ALS patients reveals molecular pathways involved in motor neuron degeneration",
      "content": "IntroductionAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder causing progressive motor neuron death in cortex, brainstem and spinal cord. The most common genetic cause is the G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the non-coding region of exon 1 of C9ORF72, accounting for ~40% of familial and ~7% of sporadic ALS. RNA dysregulation is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to ALS pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify specific microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in motor neuron degeneration in C9ORF72-ALS.MethodsWe profiled 754 miRNAs in human post-mortem spinal cord tissue from C9ORF72-ALS patients and healthy donors. Laser capture microdissection isolated ventral horn regions, and in silico target prediction identified potential genes and pathways regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs. Target genes were validated by Real time PCR.ResultsTwo subsets of miRNAs were exclusively expressed in ventral horn regions: miR-200b-3p and miR-346 in C9ORF72-ALS patients, and miR-30d-5p, miR-106b-5p and miR-135a-5p in healthy donors. Target prediction and molecular analysis identified putative genes and pathways linked to cell death, inflammation, protein metabolism, DNA modification, excitotoxicity, autophagy and vesicles trafficking.DiscussionThis study identifies specific miRNAs and their target genes as key molecules in motor neuron degeneration in C9ORF72-ALS. Restoring their expression could represent a therapeutic approach for ALS.",

      "title": "A narrative review of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) applications in hearing loss, tinnitus and vestibular disorders",
      "content": "IntroductionFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising neuroimaging modality for investigating cortical activity in auditory and vestibular domains. Its portability, device compatibility, and motion tolerance make it particularly suited for use in populations that are challenging to study with conventional neuroimaging techniques, such as infants and cochlear implant (CI) users. The present study aims to explore the potential and limitations of this neuroimaging technique in the audiological and vestibular fields, offering an integrated perspective across pediatric, adult and elderly populations.MethodsA narrative review of studies using fNIRS in hearing loss, tinnitus, and vestibular disorders was conducted through searches in PubMed and Scopus up to March 2025. Studies were included if they employed fNIRS to investigate cortical responses in individuals with diagnosed hearing loss, chronic tinnitus or to investigate vestibular function.ResultsA total of 60 studies were reviewed: 36 on hearing loss, 11 on tinnitus, and 13 on vestibular disorders. In hearing research, fNIRS successfully identified cortical activation patterns related to auditory perception, speech processing, and cross-modal plasticity in CI users across development, adulthood and aging. The technique showed prognostic potential in predicting CI outcomes and monitoring listening effort and cognitive load. In tinnitus research, fNIRS consistently demonstrate hyper-activation in the auditory cortex and altered functional connectivity with frontal-limbic networks, reflecting sensory, cognitive, and emotional involvement. The technique was sensitive to treatment effects following interventions such as transcranial stimulation, acupuncture, and cochlear implantation. In vestibular research, fNIRS enabled the mapping of cortical networks involved in balance control and multisensory integration during various stimulation paradigms, including caloric testing, motion platforms, and optic flow in virtual environments. Although current applications are mostly exploratory, findings suggest fNIRS can capture vestibular-related cortical activity in real-world conditions.ConclusionfNIRS offers a valuable, non-invasive, and ecologically valid method for investigating auditory and vestibular function across the lifespan. In hearing and tinnitus research, it shows strong potential for clinical translation, especially if methodological standardization is achieved. Applications in vestibular research remain preliminary but promising.",

      "content": "BackgroundCurrent clinical research suggests that the ketogenic diet (KD) intervention can alleviate Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This pilot study explored the potential link between KD-induced clinical improvements and gut microbiota alterations.MethodsWe engaged 27 PD patients in a 12-week ketogenic dietary trial (16 completed) and employed 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze gut microbiota differences compared to 27 healthy controls.ResultsBaseline analysis revealed distinct dysbiosis in PD patients, characterized by increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae. Following the 12-week intervention, patients exhibited significant improvements in both motor (MDS-UPDRS Part III, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and non-motor symptoms (NMSS, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). These clinical improvements were accompanied by specific microbial shifts: a significant increase in Enterococcus and Synergistota, and a decrease in Alloprevotella.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the therapeutic effects of the ketogenic diet in PD are associated with specific remodeling of the gut microbiota, particularly the enrichment of potential beneficial taxa and reduction of pro-inflammatory genera.Clinical trial registrationhttps://www.chictr.org.cn/index.html, Unique Identifier: ChiCTR2100045394.",

      "title": "Perceptual punctuation: fixational eye movements reveal segmentation of auditory streams",
      "content": "IntroductionPerception operates as rhythmically structured sampling in which temporal predictions determine when incoming signals are weighted. Fixational eye movements carry opposing consequences, enhancing acuity yet inducing brief peri-saccadic suppression, suggesting that their timing is paced by expected, salient rhythms. Auditory scenes can be parsed into competing streams that unfold over time. If fixation dynamics are shaped by temporal expectation, and auditory streaming imposes a percept-dependent temporal structure on otherwise identical acoustics, then fixational eye movements might provide a window into how listeners parse sound over time. We asked whether fixational eye movements reflect the perceived rather than the physical temporal organization of an ambiguous ABA\u2013 pattern.MethodsWhile listeners fixated and either attended High, Low, or All tones (Experiment 1, n = 15) or freely reported their percept (Experiment 2, n = 15), we recorded binocular eye position (500 Hz) and quantified microsaccade (MS) dynamics and eye-velocity spectra.ResultsAcross both experiments, eye-velocity spectra showed a percept-dependent redistribution between 2 and 4 Hz, with relative power shifting with the instructed/reported stream. A normalized 4\u20132 Hz index (\u0394PSD) separated Low-tone from High-tone percepts across procedures. Time-resolved analyses further revealed within-trial waxing-and-waning of 2 vs. 4 Hz dominance, consistent with bistable fluctuations in maintaining a stream. Moreover, microsaccade reaction time (msRT), aligned to the onset of the sound sequence, differed significantly depending on the percept.DiscussionThese findings extend oculomotor inhibition beyond discrete events, positioning fixation dynamics as a sensitive, report-free marker of auditory scene organization. We discuss mechanistic links to temporal attention and active sensing, and implications for a multisensory timing framework.",

      "title": "Speech pattern disorders in verbally fluent individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a machine learning analysis",
      "content": "IntroductionDiagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in verbally fluent individuals based on speech patterns in examiner-patient dialogues is challenging because speech-related symptoms are often subtle and heterogeneous. This study aimed to identify distinctive speech characteristics associated with ASD by analyzing recorded dialogues from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2).MethodsWe analyzed examiner-participant dialogues from ADOS-2 Module 4 and extracted 40 speech-related features categorized into intonation, volume, rate, pauses, spectral characteristics, chroma, and duration. These acoustic and prosodic features were processed using advanced speech analysis tools and used to train machine learning models to classify ASD participants into two subgroups: those with and without A2-defined speech pattern abnormalities. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and standard classification metrics.ResultsUsing all 40 features, the support vector machine (SVM) achieved an F1-score of 84.49%. After removing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Chroma features to focus on prosodic, rhythmic, energy, and selected spectral features aligned with ADOS-2 A2 scores, performance improved, achieving 85.77% accuracy and an F1-score of 86.27%. Spectral spread and spectral centroid emerged as key features in the reduced set, while MFCC 6 and Chroma 4 also contributed significantly in the full feature set.DiscussionThese findings demonstrate that a compact, diverse set of non-MFCC and selected spectral features effectively characterizes speech abnormalities in verbally fluent individuals with ASD. The approach highlights the potential of context-aware, data-driven models to complement clinical assessments and enhance understanding of speech-related manifestations in ASD.",

      "title": "Enhancing dementia and cognitive decline detection with large language models and speech representation learning",
      "content": "Dementia poses a major challenge to individuals and public health systems. Detecting cognitive decline through spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, enabling timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study describes our submission to the PROCESS Signal Processing Grand Challenge (ICASSP 2025), which tasked participants with predicting cognitive decline from speech samples. Our method combines eGeMAPS features from openSMILE, HuBERT (a self-supervised speech representation model), and GPT-4o, OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model. These are integrated with the custom LSTM and ResMLP neural networks, and supported by Scikit-learn regressors/classifiers for both cognitive score regression and dementia classification. Our regression model based on LightGBM achieved an RMSE of 2.7775, placing us 10th out of 80 teams globally and surpassing the RoBERTa baseline by 7.5%. For the three-class classification task (Dementia/MCI/Control), our LSTM model obtained an F1-score of 0.5521, ranking 20th of 106 and marginally outperforming the best baseline. We trained models on speech data from 157 study participants, with independent evaluation performed on a separate test set of 40 individuals. We discoved that integrating large language models with self-supervised speech representations enhances the detection of cognitive decline. The proposed approach offers a scalable, data-driven method for early cognitive screening and may support emerging applications in neuropsychological informatics.",

      "title": "Subdomain adaptation method based on transferable semantic alignment and class correlation",
      "content": "To address these challenges, we propose a subdomain adaptation framework driven by transferable semantic alignment and class correlation. First, source and target domains are divided into subdomains according to class labels, and a joint subdomain distribution alignment mechanism is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution divergence while enlarging inter-class disparities. Second, a domain-adaptive semantic consistency loss is employed to cluster semantically similar samples and separate dissimilar ones in a unified representation space, enabling precise cross-domain semantic alignment. Third, pseudo-label quality in the target domain is improved via temperature-based label smoothing, complemented by a class correlation matrix and a loss function capturing inter-class relationships to exploit intrinsic intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior average classification accuracy compared to existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of semantic alignment and class correlation modeling. By explicitly modeling intra-class coherence and inter-class distinction without additional architectural complexity, the framework effectively mitigates domain shift, enhances semantic alignment, and improves recognition performance on the target domain, offering a robust solution for deep unsupervised domain adaptation.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15437v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT offer potential support for autistic people, but this potential requires understanding the implicit perspectives these models might carry, including their biases and assumptions about autism. Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15412v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mental health concerns are rising globally, prompting increased reliance on technology to address the demand-supply gap in mental health services. In particular, mental health chatbots are emerging as a promising solution, but these remain largely untested, raising concerns about safety and potential harms. In this paper, we dive into the literature to identify critical gaps in the design and implementation of mental health chatbots. We contribute an operational checklist to help guide the development and design of more trustworthy, safe, and user-friendly chatbots. The checklist serves as both a developmental framework and an auditing tool to ensure ethical and effective chatbot design. We discuss how this checklist is a step towards supporting more responsible design practices and supporting new standards for sociotechnically sound digital mental health tools.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15385v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Natural-language-to-visualization (NL2VIS) systems based on large language models (LLMs) have substantially improved the accessibility of data visualization. However, their further adoption is hindered by two coupled challenges: (i) the absence of standardized evaluation metrics makes it difficult to assess progress in the field and compare different approaches; and (ii) natural language descriptions are inherently underspecified, so multiple visualizations may be valid for the same query. To address these issues, we introduce VegaChat, a framework for generating, validating, and assessing declarative visualizations from natural language.\n  We propose two complementary metrics: Spec Score, a deterministic metric that measures specification-level similarity without invoking an LLM, and Vision Score, a library-agnostic, image-based metric that leverages a multimodal LLM to assess chart similarity and prompt compliance.\n  We evaluate VegaChat on the NLV Corpus and on the annotated subset of ChartLLM. VegaChat achieves near-zero rates of invalid or empty visualizations, while Spec Score and Vision Score exhibit strong correlation with human judgments (Pearson 0.65 and 0.71, respectively), indicating that the proposed metrics support consistent, cross-library comparison.\n  The code and evaluation artifacts are available at https://zenodo.org/records/17062309.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15308v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extended Reality (XR), including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, provides immersive and interactive experiences across diverse applications, from VR-based education to AR-based assistance and MR-based training. However, widespread XR adoption remains limited due to two key challenges: 1) the high cost and complexity of authoring 3D content, especially for large-scale environments or complex interactions; and 2) the steep learning curve associated with non-intuitive interaction methods like handheld controllers or scripted gestures. Generative AI (GenAI) presents a promising solution by enabling intuitive, language-driven interaction and automating content generation. Leveraging vision-language models and diffusion-based generation, GenAI can interpret ambiguous instructions, understand physical scenes, and generate or manipulate 3D content, significantly lowering barriers to XR adoption. This paper explores the integration of XR and GenAI through three concrete use cases, showing how they address key obstacles in scalability and natural interaction, and identifying technical challenges that must be resolved to enable broader adoption.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.15295v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Interactive narrative (IN) authors craft spaces of divergent narrative possibilities for players to explore, with the player's input determining which narrative possibilities they actually experience. Generative AI can enable new forms of IN by improvisationally expanding on pre-authored content in response to open-ended player input. However, this extrapolation risks widening the gap between author-envisioned and player-experienced stories, potentially limiting the strength of plot progression and the communication of the author's narrative intent. To bridge the gap, we introduce Elsewise: an authoring tool for AI-based INs that implements a novel Bundled Storyline concept to enhance author's perception and understanding of the narrative possibility space, allowing authors to explore similarities and differences between possible playthroughs of their IN in terms of open-ended, user-configurable narrative dimensions. A user study (n=12) shows that our approach improves author anticipation of player-experienced narrative, leading to more effective control and exploration of the narrative possibility spaces.",
