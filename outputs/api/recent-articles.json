      "title": "Curvature-based machine learning method for automated segmentation of dendritic spines",
      "content": "Recent advances in connectomics have been led by high-resolution reconstruction of large volumes of neural tissues using electron microscopy (EM), providing unprecedented insights into brain structure and function. Dendritic spines--dynamic protrusions on neuronal dendrites--play crucial roles in synaptic plasticity, influencing learning, memory, and various neurological disorders. However, current spine analysis methods often rely on manual annotation of subcellular features, limiting their ability to handle the complexity of spines in dense dendritic networks. This paper introduces a novel automated computational framework that integrates discrete differential geometry, machine learning, and 3D image processing to analyze dendritic spines in these intricate environments. By generating distributions of spine morphology from high resolution images including many thousands of spines, our approach captures subtle variations in spine shapes, offering a nuanced understanding of their roles in synaptic function. This framework is tested on multiple EM datasets, with the aim of enhancing our understanding of synaptic plasticity and its alterations in disease states. The proposed method is poised to accelerate neuroscience research by providing a scalable, objective, and comprehensive solution for spine analysis, uncovering insights into the role of spine geometry for neural function.",

      "title": "Protective effect of prior knowledge in ageing",
      "content": "Visual perception depends on both sensory input and prior knowledge, and the quality of these information sources changes across the lifespan. As people age, accumulated knowledge, and its influence on perception, tend to increase, while declines in low-level visual functions reduce input quality and bias perception toward prior information. Yet, the combined effects of these changes on higher-level visual perception remain unclear, partly because concurrent cognitive decline may complicate the use of stored knowledge. In this study, we examined how prior knowledge shapes visual perception in younger (<40 years) and older (>60 years) adults using ambiguous two-tone images, whose recognition depends on prior knowledge. Providing participants with the original photographs used to generate the two-tones triggered perceptual reorganisation, improving recognition in both groups. Although older adults recognised fewer two-tones overall - a pattern linked to reduced visual acuity - they showed a comparable benefit from prior knowledge when cued. These findings suggest that, despite age-related sensory decline, the ability to draw on prior knowledge remains robust in older adulthood and may help preserve perceptual function.",

      "title": "From Ions to Chaos: exploring a whole-brain modelling framework in the mouse",
      "content": "Computational neuroscience offers powerful tools for understanding brain function in both healthy and diseased states. However, detailed data on microscale mechanisms - such as those involved in genetics and pharmacology - are often derived from mouse experiments and further lack integration into whole-brain models. In this work, we bridge microscale ion-channel dynamics and macroscale network behavior by employing the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model on The Virtual Brain platform with a mouse brain connectome. Our simulations reproduced key findings from prior computational studies with the Larter-Breakspear model, demonstrating its cross-species translation to the mouse. This included the emergence of chaotic dynamics and network synchrony as a function of coupling and delay parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Calcium, Sodium, and Potassiumrelated parameters each critically shape the global dynamic regimes and that the response to external stimuli is highly sensitive to calcium concentrations. This work represents the first integration of the Larter- Breakspear model into a mouse-scale connectome, validating previous results in a new context. In addition, it establishes a framework for a detailed exploration of synchrony, ion dependency, and stimulus reactivity. By linking molecular simulations, genetic data, and mouse electrophysiology, this approach holds promise for mechanistic insights into neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and epilepsy.",
