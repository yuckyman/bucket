      "title": "Important Changes to the 2024 ERP Boot Camp",
      "content": "<p class=\"\">We are disappointed to announce that we will not be holding a regular 10-day ERP Boot Camp this summer.</p><p class=\"\">We have held Boot Camps nearly every summer since 2007, supported by a series of generous grants from NIMH that allowed us to provide scholarships for all attendees. Unfortunately, although our recent renewal proposal received extremely positive reviews and scores, we were recently given the surprising and disappointing news that the renewal will not be funded this year. We believe that the ERP Boot Camp provides essential training to the field, and we will continue to pursue financial support to continue holding 10-day ERP Boot Camps in the future. </p><p class=\"\">In the meantime, we have partial funding that will allow us to hold a 5-day ERP Boot Camp this summer from July 8-12, 2024 in Davis, California. The workshop will include 5-days of lectures and activities on EEG and ERP measures, including practical and theoretical issues.</p><p class=\"\">Unfortunately, we will not be able to provide scholarships to pay for travel and lodging costs, and we must charge a registration fee. We are very sorry if this causes a hardship. </p><p class=\"\">We are no longer taking applications through our application portal. Instead of a competitive application process, we will simply accept the first 30 people who complete the registration process and pay the registration fee. This provides an opportunity to attend for individuals who might otherwise not make it through our ordinary application process, which is highly competitive. </p><p class=\"\">The registration fee will be $1000 (or $900 for people who register by April 15). The registration fee will cover 6 nights in a single occupancy hotel room (arriving July 7 and departing July 13), daily breakfast at the hotel, a catered lunch for each day of the workshop, and a group dinner. <strong>You must pay the registration fee with a credit card when you register.</strong> There are no exceptions to the registration fee policy.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Registration is now open</strong> at <a href=\"https://na.eventscloud.com/793175\">https://na.eventscloud.com/793175</a>.</p><p class=\"\">Given that we will accept the first 30 registrants, we encourage you to register as soon as possible. <strong>Registration will close on May 20</strong>, but we anticipate that the workshop will be filled up long before then. </p><p class=\"\">You must pay for your own transportation to Davis. Davis is approximately 20 minutes away from the Sacramento Airport (SMF). You can take the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> shuttle service or a rideshare service from SMF to Davis. If you are coming from outside North America, you may want to fly into the San Francisco airport (SFO), which is 135 km (84 miles) from Davis. We recommend taking the <a href=\"https://www.davisairporter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Airporter</a> from SFO to Davis.</p>",

      "title": "What are the virtual reality solutions for dual-task intervention to promote health in aging? A scoping review",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive-motor dual-task (CMDT) performance is crucial for everyday activities, particularly in older adults who commonly experience deficiencies in cognitive and motor domains. These impairments compromise daily functioning, causing a decrease in quality of life. However, traditional assessment and training methods face significant limitations. Conventional protocols often exhibit limited ecological validity, as they fail to replicate real-world performance demands adequately. Moreover, they are characterized by substantial methodological heterogeneity and offer restricted capacity for real-time performance monitoring and the delivery of personalized feedback. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a promising approach by creating controlled, real-life environments that enable precise assessment and personalized training. However, VR-based CMDT remains largely unexplored. This review evaluates current VR solutions for CMDT, examining assessment, and intervention designs.MethodsA scoping review was conducted on April 17, 2023 (and updated on January 21, 2025), following the PRISMA for Scoping Review guidelines, on three databases: Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed. We included original articles, based on the following criteria: English-language; original research articles reporting empirical data from experimental, quasi-experimental, or observational studies; articles employing CMDT assessment or training; use of VR-based applications during a CMDT; older population participants (\u226565 years). Reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, conceptual articles, case studies, and short papers were excluded.ResultsOf 2,649 papers, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 assessment and four training studies. Research focused on healthy older adults and individuals with early cognitive decline, sensory deficits, and those at fall risk. Assessment studies mainly employed immersive and semi-immersive systems simulating realistic scenarios in virtual environments, primarily using \u201cwalking while\u201d paradigms with cognitive tasks. Training studies frequently utilized non-immersive or semi-immersive solutions with less naturalistic environments, demonstrating improvements in gait parameters, dual-task performance, motor functions, and cognitive abilities. Substantial methodological heterogeneity was observed in intervention duration, frequency, and DT cost calculations, with limited attention to user experience evaluation.DiscussionVR-based CMDT applications show promise for assessment and intervention in aging. However, significant gaps exist regarding the lack of standardized methodological approaches, ecological validity, and user-centered design considerations. Future research should address these limitations to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of VR-based CMDT interventions.",

      "title": "A cross-continental comparative analysis of the neurological manifestations of Long COVID",
      "content": "ObjectiveTo compare demographics, comorbidities, neurologic symptoms, quality of life, and cognitive outcomes among adult individuals with neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) across countries with varying income levels: the United States (U.S.), Colombia, Nigeria, and India.MethodsIn this multi-country observational study, participants were evaluated in hospital clinics and recruited from institutional databases between 2020 and 2025. Patients were categorized as post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) or non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP). Cognitive assessments were performed using the NIH Toolbox (U.S. and Colombia), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nigeria), or the Mini-Mental State Examination (India).ResultsA total of 3,157 participants were enrolled (652 PNP; 2,505 NNP). PNP patients were predominantly male except in the US, while NNP patients were predominantly female, except in India. The most frequent neurologic symptoms were brain fog, myalgia, dizziness, headache, and sensory disturbances, with frequency highest in the U.S. and lowest in India. There were significant differences for most neurologic and non-neurologic symptoms of PASC, driven by higher frequencies in U.S. and Colombia in both PNP and NNP cohorts. In addition, cognitive impairment measured with different instruments varied across countries for both PNP and NNP groups. Multiple correspondence analysis showed clustering of symptom burden between U.S./Colombia and Nigeria/India.ConclusionNeuro-PASC presents globally but symptom burden, and psychological distress vary across regions, likely influenced by sociocultural factors, healthcare access, and diagnostic tools. These findings highlight the need for culturally-adapted screening and post-COVID care worldwide.",

      "title": "Dynamic sensor adaptation based on efferent feedback for adaptive bio-inspired sound source localization",
      "content": "Auditory perception and localization are fundamental tasks for many species, allowing them to detect, identify, and spatially localize sound sources in their environment. While biological systems have evolved sophisticated neural mechanisms for auditory adaptation, artificial auditory systems still struggle to match their performance, particularly in dynamic and noisy environments. Our research focuses on whether sensor adaptation, driven by efferent feedback from the processing stage to the sensory stage, can improve localization performance. Inspired by human sound source localization based on interaural level differences (ILD) and efferent feedback, the proposed neuromorphic system architecture is composed of two bio-inspired acoustic sensors connected to a neural processing stage, represented by two neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and two neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO). The LSO neuron response was analyzed in the following ways: (i) using measured sensor responses at different ILD without efferent feedback and with a fixed local feedback for each sensor measurement; (ii) simulated with synthetically generated sounds with varying ILDs for four different feedback configurations from the LSO neuron to the acoustic sensors. Results from (i) showed how the feedback tuning can be used to overcome mismatches due to fabrication tolerances between different MEMS sensors, and (ii) showed the influence of different feedback configurations and simulation parameters on the LSO neuron response with respect to different ILDs.",
