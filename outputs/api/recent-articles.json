      "title": "A Survey of Few-Shot Learning for Biomedical Time Series",
      "content": "Advancements in wearable sensor technologies and the digitization of medical records have contributed to the unprecedented ubiquity of biomedical time series data. Data-driven models have tremendous potential to assist clinical diagnosis and improve patient care by improving long-term monitoring capabilities, facilitating early disease detection and intervention, as well as promoting personalized healthcare delivery. However, accessing extensively labeled datasets to train data-hungry deep learning models encounters many barriers, such as long-tail distribution of rare diseases, cost of annotation, privacy and security concerns, data-sharing regulations, and ethical considerations. An emerging approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data is to augment AI methods with human-like capabilities to leverage past experiences to learn new tasks with limited examples, called few-shot learning. This survey provides a comprehensive review and comparison of few-shot learning methods for biomedical time series applications. The clinical benefits and limitations of such methods are discussed in relation to traditional data-driven approaches. This paper aims to provide insights into the current landscape of few-shot learning for biomedical time series and its implications for future research and applications.",

      "content": "Foundation model, trained on a diverse range of data and adaptable to a myriad of tasks, is advancing healthcare. It fosters the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to the intricacies of the medical field, bridging the gap between limited AI models and the varied nature of healthcare practices. The advancement of a healthcare foundation model (HFM) brings forth tremendous potential to augment intelligent healthcare services across a broad spectrum of scenarios. However, despite the imminent widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding regarding their operation in the healthcare field, their existing challenges, and their future trajectory. To answer these critical inquiries, we present a comprehensive and in-depth examination that delves into the landscape of HFMs. It begins with a comprehensive overview of HFMs, encompassing their methods, data, and applications, to provide a quick understanding of the current progress. Subsequently, it delves into a thorough exploration of the challenges associated with data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures in constructing and widely applying foundation models in healthcare. Furthermore, this survey identifies promising directions for future development in this field. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's understanding of the current progress of HFMs and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future advancements in this domain.",

      "content": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool, yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality, especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based methods, and plug-and-play models to the emerging full spectrum of generative model-based methods. We also explore the synergistic integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity, evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also discusses potential solutions and future research directions, with an emphasis on the role of data harmonization and federated learning for further improving the general applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "content": "The contribution of T cells to neuroinflammation after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains poorly understood. Using a murine pre-chiasmatic injection model of SAH we demonstrate that T cell infiltration into the brain modulates microglial activation and promotes neuronal death. Targeted transcriptomic profiling revealed a sustained neuroimmune response at 7 days post injury (dpi) characterized by a major involvement of T cells and microglia activation. Immunohistochemistry confirmed focal CD3+ T cell infiltration, predominantly CD4+, in the brain at the site of blood injection (BI), choroid plexus and meninges in SAH mice at 3- and 7-dpi. This temporal pattern was also observed in the CSF of a human SAH cohort. T cell presence spatially correlated with regions of microglial reactivity and neuronal loss. Notably, CD3-knockout mice exhibited reduced microglial activation and preserved neuronal viability. These findings identify T cells as key amplifiers of post-SAH neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Targeting T cell-microglia crosstalk may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for SAH.",

      "content": "The cortical mechanisms governing the transition from consciousness to unconsciousness remain poorly understood. While most cortical neurons are suppressed during NREM sleep and anesthesia, we identify a distinct population of prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons that are preferentially active in both states. Chemogenetic activation of these excitatory NREM- and Anesthesia-Promoting (NAP) neurons enhances anesthetic potency and deepens NREM sleep, whereas their inhibition blunts anesthetic effects. Anatomical, biophysical, and transcriptomic, biophysical, and anatomical analyses reveal that NAPs are Layer 5 extratelencephalic (L5 ET) neurons that form reciprocal connections with subcortical arousal centers including anterior and reticular thalamic nuclei, hypothalamus, and claustrum. Moreover, L5 ET specific recordings and chemogenetic manipulations reproduced NAP-like activity under anesthesia and its ability to promote NREM sleep. These findings define an excitatory, molecularly and anatomically characterized PFC circuit that contributes to loss of consciousness, consistent with a corticothalamic mechanism of arousal-state transitions in sleep and anesthesia.",

Although ethical frameworks and legal policy mechanisms affirm Indigenous rights, there is a persistent gap in translating these commitments into practice. Here we discuss how embedding Indigenous data governance across research infrastructures and data ecosystems is needed to strengthen the field\u2019s capacity to deliver beneficial outcomes for all.",
