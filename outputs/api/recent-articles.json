      "title": "Gliomas preferentially develop within the action-mode network",
      "content": "Gliomas tend to arise in specific brain regions and may integrate into functional circuits, suggesting they could be regulated by brain activity. However, it remains unclear whether glioma growth is related to system-level brain networks. Analyzing neuroimaging data from three datasets including 1,310 patients with cerebral gliomas, we identified and replicated a functionally connected glioma network, which overlaps with the action-mode network (AMN), somatomotor network (SMN), and action-related subcortical regions. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the AMN successfully predicted the location of glioma occurrence in two independent datasets with complex tumor distributions. Remarkably, no patient had a glioma entirely outside the AMN, and over 89% of patients exhibited gliomas with at least 50% overlap with the network. Moreover, the spatial overlap between glioma location and the AMN demonstrated significant prognostic value in survival analyses, with higher AMN-tumor overlap associated with poorer overall survival. Notably, the acetylcholine transporter, a key player in glioma pathogenesis that drives transcriptional reprogramming, showed an expression pattern overlapping with the AMN. Meta-analytic annotations further linked the glioma network to processes of action initiation, execution, and feedback. These findings indicate that gliomas preferentially arise in circuits involved in action and highlight the central role of the AMN in glioma pathophysiology and growth.",

      "title": "Controllable Point-Light Displays Implemented in a game engine for biological motion research",
      "content": "Biological motion perception plays a critical role in survival and social communication across species. Point-light displays (PLDs), which represent body movement using only a small set of joint markers, have long served as an effective tool for isolating motion cues from other visual features. However, existing methods for generating PLDs, ranging from filmed actors with reflective markers to markerless motion extraction and motion-capture datasets, present limitations in cost, accessibility, flexibility, or ecological validity. In particular, many laboratories lack the resources to create customizable stimuli that allow systematic manipulation of movement parameters. In this article, we introduce a practical and easily modifiable method for producing fully controllable 3D PLDs using freely available animation rigs and the Unity game engine. Our approach enables real-time control of depth cues and directional motion without the need for motion capture equipment or specialized filming environments. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we conducted a psychophysical experiment comparing the perception of biological and non-biological motion. The results replicate the well-documented forward-motion perceptual bias for biological stimuli and highlight differences in how observers interpret motion direction across stimulus classes. This method offers a convenient, accessible, and adaptable tool for research on motion perception and social cognition.",

      "title": "Regional Hypothalamic Responses to Light Vary Across Developmental Stages but Remain Stable with Time of Day",
      "content": "Background: Light plays a significant role in regulating various non-visual biological processes, such as stimulating alertness and cognition. However, the precise subcortical neural pathways are not fully established, including within the hypothalamus. In particular, how the hypothalamus processes are modulated by time-of-day and developmental stages, remains poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we used 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine in vivo the impact of different light illuminance (0.16, 37, 92, and 190 melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance: mel-EDI lux) on the activity of the hypothalamus of healthy young adults (N=33; 20 women; 24.3 +/- 3.2y) and adolescents (N=16; 5 women; 16.8 +/- 1.1y) while they completed an auditory executive task, in the morning or in the evening. Results: Performance to the task improved with increasing illuminance irrespective of time of day and age group. When focusing on time-of-day differences in young adults, we found that the regional impact of light illuminance on the activity of the hypothalamus was consistent between the morning and the evening, with the posterior and anterior hypothalamus, respectively, showing increased and decreased activity with increasing illuminance. When focusing on developmental stages differences, during the evening session only, we found similar regional patterns in adolescents and young adult. The magnitude of the response at the highest illuminance was, however, larger in adolescents, with a larger deactivation of the superior-anterior and inferior-tubular hypothalamus. Conclusions: These findings reveal a complex and non-uniform impact of light on hypothalamus activity and provide novel insights into how light influences vary with developmental stages.",

      "title": "Monolinguals outperform bilinguals in language but not executive function in aging and cognitive impairment.",
      "content": "Objective: People with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) self-report declining cognitive function, although objective cognitive performance remains normal. SCD is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Previous research has found differences in cognitive performance in bilinguals compared with monolinguals. We examined cognitive performance in older adults with and without SCD, and the association between bilingualism and cognitive performance in cognitively healthy older adults, people with SCD, and people with MCI, and the influence of bilingualism on the age of MCI diagnosis. Method: Adults aged 65+ (<em>n</em> = 264) rated their ability in French and English and self-perceived change in concentration and attention, memory, and word-finding. They then completed neuropsychological tests assessing language, memory, and executive function. Participants were monolingual or bilingual and were older adults, reported amnestic or nonamnestic SCD, or had MCI. Results: No differences in cognitive performance were observed between older adults and people with SCD, while people with MCI had lower performance on nearly all tasks. Monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in the Boston Naming Test, letter\u2013number sequencing, California Verbal Learning Test, FAS, animal, vegetable/musical instrument, and A/F switch fluency tasks, but group performance did not differ on executive function tasks. Sensitivity analyses using English L1 bilinguals who completed the first administration of the language tasks in the English or bilingual version showed that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals on only the Boston Naming Test. Monolinguals had a later age of MCI diagnosis than bilinguals in our sample. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the protective effect of bilingualism reported elsewhere in the literature is not universal. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "End-stage kidney disease patients exhibited slower responses to rapidly presented visual stimuli when compared with healthy controls.",
      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
