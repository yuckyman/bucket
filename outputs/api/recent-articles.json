      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "EEG Dynamics of Movement Preparation and Error Processing Distinguish Motor Adaptation From De Novo Learning",
      "content": "Previous research has distinguished behavioral mechanisms between motor adaptation and de novo learning. However, electroencephalography (EEG) markers dissociating them remain unclear. Here, participants (N = 32, 13 female) performed center-out reaching under a 30{degrees} fixed rotation (adaptation), mirror reversal (de novo learning), or random rotation (errors without learning), while we recorded EEG during movement preparation and post-movement feedback. We explored how perturbation type, training phase, and error magnitude shaped neural dynamics in both temporal and frequency domains. During preparation, the readiness potential (RP) showed opposite training-related modulation in the fixed and random rotations, suggesting increased reliance on updated internal models for adaptation. Mirror reversal training showed no RP change, likely reflecting reliance on effortful, explicit learning. Interestingly, we found that Lateralized Readiness Potentials (LRPs) reflected planned movement direction rather than effector-specific preparation. In the frequency domain, beta attenuation for large errors and alpha synchronization for small errors were more pronounced in the fixed rotation than in the mirror reversal, suggesting greater error-sensitivity during adaptation. During post-movement feedback, P3 amplitude decreased from early to late learning in the fixed and random rotations but remained stable in the mirror reversal, highlighting differences in cognitive demands across perturbations. A sustained late positivity emerged following small errors across perturbations, potentially indexing implicit learning. Random rotations also elicited distinct frontal and central beta modulation, likely reflecting disengagement due to task unpredictability. Together, we show that preparatory and feedback-related EEG signatures differ across perturbation types, revealing distinct neural mechanisms underlying motor adaptation and de novo learning.",

      "title": "The effect of sex on sleep EEG in typical and altered neurodevelopment",
      "content": "Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) patterns exhibit complex variations influenced by multiple factors, including sex. While sex effects in sleep neurophysiology are relatively well described in adults, evidence in pediatric populations is more limited, particularly in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we analyzed a large pediatric clinical dataset to examine sex differences in whole-night sleep EEG among children without NDDs (N=1523, 2.5-17.5 years) and those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N=196), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, N=523), and intellectual disabilities (IntDis, N=167). Medical record analysis revealed limited sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. Using the open-source package Luna, we extracted a broad range of sleep EEG features (435 in total) and found that 25% of all tested metrics showed significant sex differences in the non-NDD sample with the majority replicated in an independent population-based pediatric cohort. Non-NDD boys exhibited more fragmented sleep compared to girls, but this pattern was not observed among children with NDDs. In contrast, fast spindle density was lower in boys regardless of NDD diagnosis, which may contribute to males' increased susceptibility to developing NDDs. No sex differences were observed in EEG-based brain age predictions. Several sleep EEG metrics showed nominal group-by-sex interactions with ASD and ADHD girls displaying more pronounced alterations, pointing to a varying degree of sleep disturbance. Overall, our findings demonstrate that many sleep EEG features exhibit significant sex differences during childhood, but these differences may be distinct in NDD populations. The sex-specific sleep alterations in NDDs underscore the importance of including both sexes in future research.",

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Octopamine instructs head direction plasticity",
      "content": "Many plasticity rules rely on adjusting the strength of synapses between pairs of cells based on their coincident activity. We uncovered a new mechanism for coincidence detection in the Drosophila head direction network. To maintain an accurate sense of direction, head direction neurons that signal orientation during navigation must learn to anchor to relevant external sensory cues in novel environments. Yet the synaptic mechanism for this form of unsupervised learning is unknown in any organism. In Drosophila, GABAergic visual inputs converge onto head direction neurons, and these inhibitory synapses change strength with experience to learn the relationship between visual landmarks and head direction. However, how coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity is detected across this inhibitory synapse is not understood. We discovered that neurons which release the monoamine octopamine close a feedback loop that conveys postsynaptic head direction activity onto presynaptic terminals of visual inputs. This octopamine pathway is required for anchoring the head direction network to visual cues. Furthermore, pairing structured activation of octopamine neurons with a visual cue is sufficient to drive rapid plasticity, even without postsynaptic head direction cell activity. Previous work has extensively characterized coincidence detection mechanisms at excitatory synapses; our work defines a novel mechanism for coincidence detection at an inhibitory synapse, in which postsynaptic activity is relayed via a neuromodulatory neuron onto presynaptic terminals.",

      "title": "An algorithm underlying directional hearing in fish",
      "content": "Humans and other land vertebrates localize sound by comparing the signals in each ear. Even though these differences are virtually absent underwater, fish are still able to sense sound direction. In 1975, Arie Schuijf proposed that this ability could arise from a comparison of the particle motion phase and the pressure phase of sound, a prediction which was recently confirmed experimentally for near-field sounds. In natural environments, however, sounds arrive from variable distances, altering the motion-pressure phase relationship. Thus, directional hearing and distance hearing are potentially at conflict. There is currently neither a model nor experimental data for how fish deal with this complexity. Here, we systematically introduce phase differences to the particle motion and pressure components of sound pulses to quantify the directional tuning of startle responses in Danionella cerebrum. We find that the fish's directed startle behavior is both frequency and phase dependent, and introduce a new model that quantitatively predicts the sensorimotor transformation across all observed stimuli. This framework likely extends to other otophysan fishes with evolutionarily conserved hearing apparatus, representing ~15% of all vertebrate species.",

      "title": "Cocaine sensitization and accumbens shell plasticity depend on biological sex and gonadal hormones in C57BL/6J mice",
      "content": "Biological sex as a defining variable in drug sensitivity remains poorly understood. Here, we combine behavioral and electrophysiological analyses to examine the influence of sex and gonadal hormones on cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) plasticity in the prominent C57BL/6J mouse strain. Males exhibited greater cocaine-evoked locomotor activity than females; castration attenuated responses, whereas ovariectomy enhanced them. This behavioral phenotype is opposite to what occurs in rats. A 10-14 day abstinence period abolished the sex difference in intact animals, and gonadectomy reduced cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity. Recordings from 309 medium spiny neurons revealed sex-dependent NAcSh plasticity. In males, cocaine decreased neuronal excitability, while in females it induced estrous cycle-dependent plasticity characterized by reduced excitability during diestrus relative to estrus. These effects were driven by cocaine-induced modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels. Cocaine potentiated glutamatergic strength in males but elicited estrous cycle-dependent depotentiation in females. These adaptations in excitability and glutamatergic strength were abolished by gonadectomy, and paralleled diminished behavioral plasticity during abstinence. These data illustrate that biological sex and hormonal milieu critically shape cocaine-induced plasticity, offering a more nuanced framework than the traditional notion of heightened female sensitivity to drugs of abuse.",
