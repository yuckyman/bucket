      "title": "Chronic semaglutide treatment enhances the incentive motivational value of a small food reward and associated cue in male and female rats",
      "content": "Rationale: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such as semaglutide, are increasingly utilized in clinical practice due to their efficacy in promoting sustained weight loss following chronic administration. While acute treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has been shown to suppress food intake and reward-seeking behaviors in rodent models, the impact of prolonged exposure on preclinical measures of motivated behavior remains insufficiently characterized. Objectives: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of chronic administration of semaglutide on both the acquisition and expression phases of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PavCA), a behavioral paradigm used to assess the attribution of incentive salience to a food-paired cue. The influence of chronic semaglutide on the conditioned reinforcing properties of the food-associated cue, performance on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for food reward, and ad libitum consumption of the food reward were also assessed. Results: Chronic semaglutide administration did not significantly alter either the acquisition or the expression of PavCA behavior. However, relative to vehicle-treated controls, semaglutide markedly enhanced responding for the food-associated cue during a conditioned reinforcement test and increased PR responding for the food reward. In contrast, semaglutide reduced both free consumption of the food reward and homecage chow intake. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that chronic semaglutide administration potentiates the incentive value of food-paired cues and increases motivation for food reward under restricted access conditions, yet attenuates overall food consumption when food is freely available. This dissociation highlights the nuanced effects of semaglutide on motivated behavior and suggests an amplification of the reinforcing properties of discrete, limited food rewards and associated cues.",

      "title": "Neuromuscular Signals Shape Fatigue and Effort-Based Decision-Making in Humans",
      "content": "Physical fatigue influences our willingness to undertake effortful actions, yet the physiological signals driving this process are not well understood. We created a biofeedback paradigm to distinguish the effects of reduced muscle-force capacity from compensatory increases in neuromuscular activity on effort-based decision-making. Human participants made risky choices about prospective physical effort before and after repeated fatiguing exertions under two biofeedback conditions: force biofeedback, which required increased neuromuscular drive, and EMG biofeedback, which constrained the increase in neuromuscular drive. Both biofeedback conditions led to similar reductions in muscle strength and feelings of fatigue. Using computational modeling of choice behavior, however, we found that the Force biofeedback condition, which required compensatory neuromuscular activation, caused a significantly greater increase in the subjective cost of effort than EMG biofeedback. By combining neuromuscular manipulation with computational modeling, our study demonstrates how various physiological processes affect feelings of fatigue and decisions to exert effort in response to fatiguing exertions. These results suggest that fatigue may consist of separate components that collectively serve to motivate behavior while simultaneously protecting and restoring bodily homeostasis amid physical challenge.",

      "title": "Oxytocin enhances excitability and potentiates synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus granule cells",
      "content": "The dentate gyrus is the principal gateway for information into the hippocampus. The dentate gyrus transforms input from the entorhinal cortex into sparse, selective representations that support memory formation. Oxytocin is a key neuromodulator of social behavior and supports social memory through its actions in hippocampal area CA2. However, whether oxytocin also modulates the dentate gyrus (DG), a source of major excitatory input to CA2, remains unclear. We performed whole-cell recordings to test if oxytocin modulated the excitability of mouse dentate gyrus granule cells. We found that bath application of the oxytocin receptor agonist Thy4, Gly7-oxytocin (TGOT) increased DG granule cell excitability by depolarizing the resting membrane potential, increasing input resistance, and hyperpolarizing action potential threshold. In addition to increasing postsynaptic excitability, we found that TGOT decreased the paired-pulse ratio of perforant path to granule cell synapses and also increased the frequency, without an effect on amplitude, of miniature EPSCs suggesting that TGOT increased the probability of glutamate release. Notably, long-term potentiation induced by theta-burst pairing occluded the effect of TGOT on synaptic strength suggesting that oxytocin and long-term potentiation may converge on common downstream mechanisms. Our results revealed a previously uncharacterized role for oxytocin in regulating the relay of information between the entorhinal cortex and dentate gyrus. This suggests a potential mechanism through which oxytocin shapes hippocampal processing of socially relevant stimuli.",

      "title": "Microstructural correlates of white and gray matter in the healthy human brain: comparative analysis of diffusion biophysical models, inhomogeneous magnetization transfer, and macromolecular proton fraction",
      "content": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) and magnetization transfer (MT) rely on distinct biophysical principles and provide complementary insights into tissue microstructure. In this study, we investigated associations between microstructural metrics derived from the Standard Model (SMI) in white matter (WM) and the Standard Model with EXchange (SMEX/NEXI) in gray matter (GM) with two MT measures differing in specificity and sensitivity to myelination: the macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) and the inhomogeneous magnetization transfer ratio (ihMTR). Measurements were performed in WM and GM in ten healthy subjects scanned at 3T. In WM, the strongest significant association was observed between ihMTR and the axonal water fraction, consistent with higher myelination in regions of elevated axonal density and limited extra-axonal space. This correlation exceeded that of MPF, supporting the greater specificity of ihMTR to myelin. Interestingly, ihMTR displayed a gradient along the longitudinal axis of the corpus callosum, in agreement with previous histology measurements. Correlation between ihMTR and the extra-axonal perpendicular diffusivity (De{perp}), a putative myelination biomarker, was not significant, whereas MPF and De{perp} exhibited a moderate significant positive correlation. Since a negative correlation is expected if reflecting myelination, these results suggest that in healthy tissue De{perp} is mainly influenced by microstructural factors like fiber coherence and packing, the latter most likely affecting MPF but not ihMTR. In GM, ihMTR correlated significantly only with the exchange time (t), confirming tex as a proxy for cell membrane permeability modulated by myelin. MPF correlated exclusively with the cell-process fraction (f), suggesting the latter is modulated by total (neuronal and glial) cell membrane density. Overall, findings underscore the complementary and concurring microstructural information captured by these metrics, highlighting their potential to disentangle distinct tissue mechanisms in both healthy and pathological conditions. Future studies incorporating ground-truth histology should validate the precise sensitivity of each metric to various microstructural tissue features.",

      "title": "Investigation of CNS damage following HIV infection and methamphetamine exposure using human iPSC-derived microglia and 3D cerebral assembloid models",
      "content": "HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is characterized by glial activation and neuroinflammation emerging from HIV infection. Moreover, methamphetamine (METH) is a highly addictive psychostimulant whose use is linked to high HIV prevalence, significantly worsening clinical outcomes for people living with HIV and hastening onset of systemic illness. Overall, pathologies associated with HIV infection/METH use comorbidity include neuroinflammation, neurotoxicity, synaptodendritic damage, and resulting cognitive dysfunction. However, mechanisms underlying this neuropathogenesis remain elusive due to the scarcity of human brain-specific experimental model systems. Therefore, we created a next-generation three-dimensional (3D) human brain model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Specifically, this 3D in vitro cerebral assembloid model integrates functional microglia derived from hiPSCs with cerebral organoids. Microglia are key contributors to HAND symptoms associated with HIV/METH comorbidity. We show that the presence of microglia in this assembloid model allows productive infection with HIV, which is enhanced by METH exposure, resulting in increased glial activation, inflammatory responses (namely IL-1{beta} and IL-6 release), and neurotoxicity marked by neuronal cell death and synaptic protein loss. Importantly, in this model, we observed markedly decreased levels of the microglial receptor TREM2, which is implicated in microglial functions including phagocytosis, apoptosis and inflammatory responses following HIV infection and METH treatment. Analysis of our model showed that decreased TREM2 function may lead to HIV- and METH-associated pathological changes. Overall, our assembloid model could be a valuable tool for future analyses of HIV/METH/CNS interactions and mechanisms underlying HAND, which could lead to novel therapeutic approaches to decreasing the CNS viral reservoir.",

      "title": "A transient feature of the inferior olive supports thedevelopment of cerebellar internal models",
      "content": "The inferior olive (IO) supports motor learning by supplying the cerebellum with critical sensory and motor input. In adult rats, that input includes externally generated limb stimulation. In contrast, the IO of postnatal day 8 (P8) rats does not exhibit responses to external stimuli. Instead, IO activity primarily reflects corollary discharges associated with the production of self-generated limb twitches during active (REM) sleep. Because corollary discharges are necessary for the computation of internal models, we tested the hypothesis that IO-related corollary discharge is necessary for the emergence of a functioning cerebellar internal model during development. First, by conducting extracellular recordings in the IO at P12 and P20, we confirmed the presence of twitch-related corollary discharge at both ages; however, whereas the IO at P20 responded to limb stimulation, the IO at P12 did not. Next, using a protocol for selectively lesioning the climbing fibers that connect the IO to the cerebellum, including the interpositus nucleus (IP), we confirmed that lesioning at P12 prevents the IP's expression of corollary discharge at P13. Finally, we assessed the necessity of IO input to the cerebellum for the emergence of an internal model by lesioning climbing fibers at P12 or P19 and testing for the expression of a cerebellar internal model in the thalamus at P20. Only when the lesions occurred at P12 was the expression of the internal model severely disrupted. These findings provide the most direct evidence to date linking twitch-related corollary discharge to the developmental emergence of a cerebellar-dependent internal model.",

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "content": "<p>Hi HN, we're Aakash and Shuangling of InspectMind (<a href=\"https://www.inspectmind.ai/\">https://www.inspectmind.ai/</a>), an AI \u201cplan checker\u201d that finds issues in construction drawings, details, and specs.<p>Construction drawings quietly go out with lots of errors: dimension conflicts, co-ordination gaps, material mismatches,  missing details and more. These errors turn into delays and hundreds of thousands of dollars of rework during construction. InspectMind reviews the full drawing set of a construction project in minutes. It cross-checks architecture, engineering, and specifications to catch issues that cause rework before building begins.<p>Here\u2019s a video with some examples: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvn1FyHRlLQ</a>.<p>Before this, I (Aakash) built an engineering firm that worked on ~10,000 buildings across the US. One thing that always frustrated us: a lot of design coordination issues don\u2019t show up until construction starts. By then, the cost of a mistake can be 10\u2013100x higher, and everyone is scrambling to fix problems that could have been caught earlier.<p>We tried everything including checklists, overlay reviews, peer checks but scrolling through 500\u20132000 PDF sheets and remembering how every detail connects to every other sheet is a brittle process. City reviewers and GC pre-con teams try to catch issues too, yet they still sneak through.<p>We thought: if models can parse code and generate working software, maybe they can also help reason about the built environment on paper. So we built something we wished we had!<p>You upload drawings and specs (PDFs). The system breaks them into disciplines and detail hierarchies, parses geometry and text, and looks for inconsistencies: - Dimensions that don\u2019t reconcile across sheets; - Clearances blocked by mechanical/architectural elements; - Fire/safety details missing or mismatched; - Spec requirements that never made it into drawings; - Callouts referencing details that don\u2019t exist.<p>The output is a list of potential issues with sheet refs and locations for a human to review. We don\u2019t expect automation to replace design judgment, just to help ACE professionals not miss the obvious stuff. Current AIs are good at obvious stuff, plus can process data at quantities way beyond what humans can accurately do, so this is a good application for them.<p>Construction drawings aren't standardized and every firm names things differently. Earlier \u201cautomated checking\u201d tools relied heavily on manually-written rules per customer, and break when naming conventions change. Instead, we\u2019re using multimodal models for OCR + vector geometry, callout graphs across the entire set, constraint-based spatial checks, and retrieval-augmented code interpretation. No more hard-coded rules!<p>We\u2019re processing residential, commercial, and industrial projects today. Latency ranges from minutes to a few hours depending on sheet count. There\u2019s no onboarding required, simply upload PDFs. There are still lots of edge cases (PDF extraction weirdness, inconsistent layering, industry jargon), so we\u2019re learning a lot from failures, maybe more than successes. But the tech is already delivering results that couldn\u2019t be done with previous tools.<p>Pricing is pay-as-you-go: we give an instant online quote per project after you upload the project drawings. It\u2019s hard to do regular SaaS pricing since one project may be a home remodel and another may be a highrise. We\u2019re open to feedback on that too, we\u2019re still figuring it out.<p>If you work with drawings as an architect, engineer, MEP, GC preconstruction, real estate developer, plan reviewer  we\u2019d love a chance to run a sample set and hear what breaks, what\u2019s useful, and what\u2019s missing!<p>We\u2019ll be here all day to go into technical details about geometry parsing, clustering failures, code reasoning attempts or real-world construction stories about how things go wrong. Thanks for reading! We\u2019re happy to answer anything and look forward to your comments!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219386</a></p>\n<p>Points: 3</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "Objective: This article\u2019s objective was to compare demographic/medical history and multidomain clinical assessment outcomes between older and middle-aged adults following concussion. Method: Seventy-six patients aged 50\u201380 years within 12 months of a concussion from a specialty clinic between October 2021 and August 2023 participated in the study. Participants were grouped into older (\u226560 years) and middle-aged (50\u201359 years) adults. At their first clinic visit, participants completed multidomain clinical assessments comprising symptoms, cognitive, vestibular/ocular motor, psychological health, and quality of life domains. Results: Older adults (<em>n</em> = 35) had less females (40.0% vs. 68.3%, <em>p</em> = .01), anxiety history (17.1% vs. 39.0%, <em>p</em> = .036), and employed individuals (57.1% vs. 82.9%, <em>p</em> = .002) than middle-aged adults (<em>n</em> = 41). Older adults had better Neuro-Quality of Life, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 6.8, <em>p</em> = .01, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.09; Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status recall, <em>F</em>(1, 71) = 12.6, <em>p</em>< .001, \u03b7\n<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.15; fluency,<em> F</em>(1, 71) = 5.7, <em>p</em> = .02, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.08; list recall, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.2, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07; and list recognition, <em>F</em>(1, 69) = 5.3, <em>p</em> = .03, \u03b7<sub>p</sub>\u00b2 = 0.07, when controlling for sex, anxiety history, and employment status. Older adults also had lower odds of being impaired to borderline on Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing verbal memory (<em>OR</em> = 0.05, 95% CI [0.01, 0.56], <em>p</em> = .01), visual motor speed (<em>OR</em> = 0.08, 95% CI [0.01, 0.73],<em> p</em> = .03), and reaction time (<em>OR</em> = 0.21, 95% CI [0.05, 0.89], <em>p</em> = .03), and lower odds of having moderate to severe impairment on Neuro-Quality of Life (<em>OR</em> = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.97], <em>p</em> = .04) than middle-aged adults. Conclusions: Older adults (\u226560 years) exhibited fewer subjective cognitive difficulties and objective cognitive impairments compared to middle-aged adults (50\u201359 years) following concussion. There were no differences between groups in symptoms, vestibular/ocular motor functioning, or psychological health. Clinicians should consider these findings when evaluating and interpreting outcomes from older and middle-aged adults following concussion.

While studying <strong>Generators (</strong><code>yield</code><strong>)</strong> and <strong>Memory Management</strong>, I realized that reading tutorials wasn't enough, so I decided to build something real to prove these concepts.</p> <p>I created <strong>PyEventStream</strong>, and I would love your feedback on my implementation.</p> <p><strong>What My Project Does</strong> PyEventStream is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool designed to process large data streams (logs, mock data, huge files) without loading them into RAM. It uses a modular pipeline architecture (Source -&gt; Filter -&gt; Transform -&gt; Sink) powered entirely by Python Generators to achieve <strong>O(1) memory complexity</strong>. It allows users to filter and mask data streams in real-time.</p> <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Python Learners:</strong> Intermediate developers who want to see a practical example of <code>yield</code>, Decorators, and Context Managers in action.</li> <li><strong>Data Engineers:</strong> Anyone interested in lightweight, memory-efficient ETL pipelines without heavy dependencies like Pandas or Spark.</li> <li><strong>Interview Preppers:</strong> A clean codebase example demonstrating SOLID principles and Design Patterns.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Comparison</strong> Unlike loading a file with <code>readlines()</code> or using Pandas (which loads data into memory), this tool processes data line-by-line using Lazy Evaluation. It is meant to be a lightweight, dependency-free alternative for stream processing tasks.</p> <p><strong>Tech Stack &amp; Concepts:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Generators:</strong> To handle infinite data streams.</li> <li><strong>Factory Pattern:</strong> To dynamically switch between Mock data and Real files.</li> <li><strong>Custom Decorators:</strong> To monitor the performance of each step.</li> <li><strong>Argparse:</strong> For the CLI interface.</li> </ul> <p>I know I'm still early in my journey, but I tried to keep the code clean and follow SOLID principles.</p> <p>If you have a spare minute, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on my architecture or code style!</p> <p><strong>Repo:</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/denizzozupek/PyEventStream\">https://github.com/denizzozupek/PyEventStream</a></p> <p>Thanks! \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/denoxcilin\"> /u/denoxcilin </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj4ml6/i_built_a_memoryefficient_cli_tool_to_understand/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1pj4ml6/i_built_a_memoryefficient_cli_tool_to_understand/\">[comments]</a></span>",
