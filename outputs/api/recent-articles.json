      "content": "Long-Stokes-shift fluorophores enable high sensitivity and multiplexed imaging with single-wavelength excitation. Under single-photon conditions ATTO 490LS exhibits a 165-nm Stokes shift, but its two-photon properties remain uncharacterised. Emission and excitation spectral analyses of ATTO 490LS in ex vivo Drosophila melanogaster brains identified two-photon excitation sensitivity at 940 nm, with peak emission at 640 nm. We demonstrate successful duplexed imaging of ATTO 490LS alongside Alexa Fluor 488 using a single 920-nm fibre laser and dual photomultiplier tubes, enabling distinct measurement of red and green fluorescence signals. These findings establish ATTO 490LS as suitable for multicolour two-photon microscopy with single-laser systems.",

      "title": "Neural dynamics outside task-coding dimensions drive decision trajectories through transient amplification",
      "content": "Most behaviors involve neural dynamics in high-dimensional activity spaces. A common approach is to extract dimensions that capture task-related variability, such as those separating stimuli or choices, yielding low-dimensional, task-aligned neural activity subspaces (\"coding dimensions\"). However, whether these dimensions actively drive decisions or merely reflect underlying computations remains unclear. Moreover, neural activity outside these coding subspaces (\"residual dimensions\") is often ignored, though it could also causally shape neural dynamics driving behavior. We developed a recurrent neural network model that fits population activity and uncovers the dynamic interactions between coding and residual subspaces on single trials. Applied to electrophysiological recordings from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and motor thalamus in mice performing a delayed response task, our model demonstrates that perturbations of residual dimensions reliably alter behavioral choices, whereas perturbations of the choice dimension, which strongly encodes the animal's upcoming decision, are largely ineffective. These perturbation effects arise because residual dimensions drive transient amplification across an intermediate number of coding and residual dimensions (~10), before the dynamics collapse into discrete attractor states corresponding to the animal's choice. By dissecting the low-dimensional variability underlying error trials, we find that it primarily shifts trajectories along residual dimensions, biasing single decisions. Residual activity in thalamus shapes cortical decision dynamics, implicating weakly selective thalamic populations in the emergence of cortical selectivity. Our findings challenge the conventional focus on low-dimensional coding subspaces as sufficient framework for understanding neural computations, demonstrating that dimensions previously considered task-irrelevant and accounting for little variance can have a critical role in driving behavior.",

      "title": "High extraversion enhances attentional control through dynamic network reorganization",
      "content": "The extraversion-introversion dimension of personality is hypothesized to differ based on low or high cortical arousal, respectively. Notably, high cortical arousal in introverts is thought to underlie increased distractibility. Here, we assess fMRI while participants meditate (focused attention to their breath) under three levels of auditory distraction: no, low and high. Whereas introverts exhibited worsening attentional focus on their breath with increasing distraction, extraverts retained their ability to focus attention despite distraction. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis indicated that extraverts exhibited less globally efficient and less modular networks, which may prevent distracting stimuli from creating interference. Furthermore, connectivity strengths amongst the default mode, central executive, and salience networks were increased for extraverts and decreased in introverts during high focused attention; potentially indicating distinct cognitive processes that support attentional control. These findings support the hypothesis regarding differing levels of cortical arousal in extraverts and introverts and extend personality theory by linking the extraversion dimension to attentional control and functional connectivity dynamics.",

      "title": "Multiple longitudinal tracts in the cephalopod arm sensorimotor system",
      "content": "Octopuses have an incredibly rich behavioral repertoire, exhibiting complex motor acts that require the coordination of eight highly flexible arms, each with hundreds of suckers. These movements are controlled by an axial nerve cord (ANC), equivalent to the spinal cord, situated in the center of the arm musculature. The ANC has a cell body layer which forms a U-shape around its neuropil and is capped aborally, or opposite the sucker, by the cerebrobrachial tract (CBT), a massive fiber bundle known to interconnect the arms and the brain. In vertebrate spinal cords, in addition to the major fiber tracts that interconnect the brain and spinal cord, there are spinospinal connectives that coordinate complex motor behaviors across the appendages. Here, we asked with tract-tracing and immunohistochemistry, whether an octopus arm's ANC might also have intrinsic longitudinal connections for coordinated arm and sucker movements. We found that the ANC neuropil is enriched in longitudinal fibers. These fibers form distinct tracts, two within the oral (sucker-side) neuropil and two in the aboral (brachial-side) neuropil. In addition, CBT itself demonstrates four major subtracts, and DiI labeling and dextran tracing suggests that (1) the CBT also carries arm-intrinsic longitudinal connections and (2) the CBT and the neuropil tracts can be subcategorized into those that primarily connect with the sucker and those that serve the arm musculature. We also examined the organization of fiber-tracts in the ANC of the arms and tentacles of two species of squid, establishing that an aboral, extra-neuropil tract is a shared feature across all cephalopod species studied. In addition, the squids also had an oral longitudinal tract, though its positioning and size varied with species and appendage. In sum, these findings describe the neural substrate for coordinating motor behaviors across the length of a cephalopod appendage.",
