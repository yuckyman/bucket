      "title": "Mesenchymal stem cell-extracellular vesicles deliver microRNAs that prevent nerve growth factor-induced sensory neuron sensitization",
      "content": "Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 600 million individuals globally, pain being a hallmark symptom. Emerging clinical evidence supports the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) for pain relief in knee OA. In mice, MSC-EVs ameliorate OA-induced pain and normalize knee-innervating neuron excitability. Moreover, it has been shown that overnight incubation of sensory neurons with MSC-EVs prevents the OA-associated mediator nerve growth factor (NGF) sensitizing sensory neurons. Here, we found that protease-mediated MSC-EV 'shaving' inhibited MSC-EV internalization into sensory neurons and the ability of MSC-EVs to prevent NGF-induced sensitization. In addition, acute, 10-minute, exposure of sensory neurons to MSC-EVs was also insufficient to counteract NGF. We hypothesized that MSC-EVs trigger transcriptional changes and found that inhibiting transcription prevented NGF-induced sensitization. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be delivered to cells by MSC-EVs, and certain miRNAs regulate transcription and pain; small RNA-sequencing of our MSC-EVs identified three candidate miRNAs, miR-21-5p, miR-148a-3p and miR-451a. Using gold nanoparticle delivery, each miRNA was able to prevent NGF sensitization of sensory neurons, a combination of all three showing the most pronounced effect. These findings demonstrate that MSC-EVs prevent NGF-induced sensory neuron sensitization via cellular uptake and transcriptional regulation that is mediated by miRNAs.",

      "title": "Passage of time at the level of milliseconds: a new approach and a selective difficulty in individuals with schizophrenia",
      "content": "Individuals with schizophrenia report that to them time sometimes feels discontinuous. Previous work has shown a link between the sense of self, and the ability to prepare to react to a target and to benefit from the passage of time, at the level of a few hundreds of milliseconds. However, the sense of time continuity requires a higher time resolution than examined in previous studies. Here we investigate to which extent individuals with schizophrenia and controls benefit from an increased delay when detecting asynchronies in the order of tens of milliseconds (stimulus onset asynchronies, i.e. SOA) between two successive visual stimuli. We re-analyzed three datasets and contrasted performance when the SOA increases, remains identical or decreases from trial t-1 to trial t. Performance of all participants improved with an increase in the SOA, as the task became easier, but for controls more so than individuals with schizophrenia. These results are replicated across datasets, and were specific to the condition when SOA increased from one trial to the next. There was no significant group difference when the SOA decreased or remained identical. This was true even when the latter condition was more frequent, and when SOA magnitude was equalized across the conditions. Importantly, the difference between the two groups was specific to temporal judgements, and was not observed in a control masking task. We suggest the results reveal a difficulty for individuals with schizophrenia to experience time at the level of milliseconds.",

      "title": "Dynamical Interrogation of Serpentine Medulla Circuits in the Drosophila Optic Lobe",
      "content": "Dense connectomes invite a tempting leap: if we can \"wire up\" a circuit, perhaps its dynamics (and even its function) will emerge. In practice, connectomic constraints leave large biophysical degrees of freedom (synapse signs/strengths, neuromodulation, gap junctions), so qualitative dynamical claims can be fragile. We present a simple forensic workflow for testing connectome-to-dynamics hypotheses that is deliberately hostile to wishful thinking: each stage is gated by sanity checks, run across multiple random seeds, and reported with effect sizes and negative controls. As a case study, we instantiate the Serpentine Medulla (Sm) interneuron family from FlyWire as a current-based adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) network and test a sharp narrative: whether strong recurrence supports a working-memory-style bistable attractor. Under strict attractor criteria (noise removed after the kick), we find no robust evidence for bistability (paired Wilcoxon p = 0.099, within-subject dz = -0.25). For oscillations, a corrected reproduction across 20 random seeds shows that recurrent coupling strongly amplifies integrated 30-80 Hz power when comparing the fully coupled condition (Full W) to an uncoupled control (W = 0) (paired Wilcoxon p = 1.9 x 10-6; dz = 5.96). We also observe a fast negative-coupling signature in input decomposition (mean peak correlation r {approx} -0.40 at ~ 4 ms lag), while stressing that these signatures are conditional on the chosen model class and operating point. Overall, the main contribution is methodological: an auditable template for falsifying attractive connectome-based stories rather than polishing them.",
