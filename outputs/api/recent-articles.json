      "title": "Minimally verbal children with autism may see the global, but point local: A behavioral and eye-tracking study in visual perceptual processing",
      "content": "Recent work suggests that pointing based assessments may underestimate or mischaracterize perceptual and cognitive abilities in minimally verbal autism (mvASD). Extending this line of work, we address the classic global local question by testing whether mvASD children access global visual structur and whether it is consistently expressed in behavior using Kanizsa illusory contours (KIC) and circular colinear contours (CC). Typically developing (TD) and mvASD children viewed KIC and CC stimuli on a touchscreen while spontaneous eye gaze and pointing were recorded. Participants also completed a goal directed drag and drop matching task that required selecting the solid shape corresponding to the global KIC configuration. In spontaneous responses, mvASD children were more drawn to local elements (e.g., individual inducers, the CC frame, single Gabors) and showed less centralized responding than TD peers. Notably, CC pointing was often anchored to one half of the contour regardless of contour screen location, suggesting object centered global selection. Also, in the drag and drop task, approx. 90% of mvASD participants performed above chance in at least one condition and half performed at ceiling, demonstrating accurate global matching. These findings suggest that global structure is available in mvASD but may be underweighted in spontaneous response selection under ambiguity, consistent with the Affordance Competition Hypothesis and ambiguity resolution accounts.",

      "title": "Dual Engram Architecture within a Single Striatal Cell Type Distinctly Controls Alcohol Relapse and Extinction",
      "content": "Relapse is a major obstacle in the treatment of alcohol and drug addiction and is thought to be driven by persistent drug-associated memories formed during their use. Behavioral therapies such as extinction training can reduce relapse and are proposed to work by creating a competing memory trace. However, where and how these opposing memories are stored in the brain is unknown. Here, we show that two anatomically and functionally distinct engram ensembles within the same genetically defined striatal cell type, direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs), encode these opposing memories. Using engram-tagging tools in mice, we found that the acquisition of operant alcohol learning recruits a dMSN ensemble enriched in the striatal matrix compartment that stores alcohol-associated memories and whose activation selectively promotes relapse. Conversely, extinction of alcohol seeking recruits a dMSN ensemble enriched in the striosome compartment that stores extinction-related memories and whose activation suppresses relapse. Furthermore, we reveal that the physical memory trace storing the relapse-promoting memory is embedded within persistently strengthened corticostriatal synapses engaged during learning, and that artificially reproducing this plasticity is sufficient to trigger relapse-like behavior. These findings uncover a dual-engram architecture within dMSNs that governs relapse and extinction, providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how competing memories regulate drug-seeking behavior.",

      "title": "Dose-dependent power and connectivity modulation of low frequency oscillations through transcranial magnetic stimulation in non-human primates.",
      "content": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful non-invasive tool for safely modulating neural activity in humans. In particular, the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a common target site for clinical interventions in disorders such as treatment-resistant depression. Yet, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of TMS often lack neural markers of target engagement of the DLPFC. Local field potentials (LFPs), such as prefrontal theta oscillations, have been implicated in the clinical symptoms of these disorders. However, non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in humans are limited by their spatial resolution and challenges of interpreting EEG signals. In this study, we investigate the effects of single-pulse TMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex in non-human primates on LFPs recorded through intracranial EEG. Compared to sham TMS, the intensity of active TMS pulses scaled with LFP power changes in a 1-13 Hz range at contacts close to the stimulation site in the prefrontal cortex (e.g., caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex) as well as contacts that were more distal (e.g., posterior cingulate cortex, temporal lobe). To test how TMS modulates connectivity between these regions, we conducted a phase-based connectivity analysis. TMS pulses initially enhanced and then disrupted connectivity at 1-13 Hz between the stimulation site and other contacts. Connectivity rebounded approximately 1500 ms post-stimulation. Only the initial enhancement in connectivity scaled with TMS intensity. Our results demonstrate a dose-dependent power modulation of low frequency LFPs across prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortical regions by single pulses. Furthermore, they show that TMS applied over the left prefrontal cortex can enhance and interrupt short- and long-range connectivity. Our study advances the understanding of the effects of TMS on brain oscillations and connectivity with direct relevance for clinical applications in neuromodulation therapies.",

      "title": "Not all minds think alike: Examining the impact of time and task on visual and verbal thought.",
      "content": "Research suggests that individuals have different phenomenological experiences across various tasks. However, little is known about how these experiences vary by task or over time. This study examined participants\u2019 experiences of task-unrelated thoughts (i.e., TUTs), visual, and verbal thoughts across two experimental sessions and two different tasks. In addition, we examined relations between participants\u2019 thoughts and key individual difference factors. In Session 1, participants (<em>n</em> = 85) engaged in a focused-attention meditation and a reading task, then completed a second identical session with a new text. Throughout both tasks, participants were prompted to report on the characteristics of their thoughts. Participants\u2019 ratings of TUT, visual, and verbal thoughts were subject to change over time. Furthermore, on average, participants visualized more and had fewer TUTs while reading compared to meditation; however, no task difference was found for verbal-thinking reports. This suggests that visual imagery is more malleable than verbal-thinking. There was a strong negative correlation between visual and verbal thoughts, suggesting that at any given time, individuals\u2019 thoughts tended to be either predominantly visual or verbal. Finally, individual differences in the tendency to become immersed in narratives and motivation to engage with other people\u2019s perspectives (i.e., mind-reading motivation) were related to higher reports of visual imagery during reading, whereas verbal-thinking was negatively associated with mind-reading motivation and unrelated to TUT. Overall, this study revealed that individuals\u2019 phenomenological experiences vary during tasks and across time, providing a foundation for future work to examine why and how variability in these phenomenological experiences emerge.

      "title": "Motor Intention Drives Corticospinal Facilitation during Interception Planning",
      "content": "Intercepting a moving target requires integrating visual motion information with motor preparation, yet how action intention and gaze strategy jointly shape corticospinal excitability during interception planning remains unclear. We applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over primary motor cortex to probe corticospinal excitability while participants either prepared to intercept a moving target or passively viewed its motion. Targets moved at one of two speeds, and participants judged target speed relative to a reference after each trial. Across blocks, participants were instructed to either smoothly pursue the target or fixate their eyes on the interception zone. Motor-evoked potentials were elicited at baseline, after task instruction, early during target motion, or shortly before target arrival. Task goal and gaze strategy interacted to influence both perceptual judgments and corticospinal excitability. Passive viewing led to overestimation of target speed and was associated with sustained suppression of corticospinal excitability, particularly during fixation. In contrast, preparing to intercept produced a robust facilitation of corticospinal excitability immediately before movement onset, regardless of gaze strategy. Smooth pursuit improved perceptual accuracy and reduced interception timing error compared with fixation but did not independently influence corticospinal facilitation. These findings demonstrate that the intention to act is the primary determinant of the transition from corticospinal suppression to facilitation during interception planning, whereas eye movements modulate perceptual estimates and support behavioral performance.",

      "content": "Previous research has shown that the eyes' pupils are larger when imaging dark as compared to bright objects or scenes. Based on this, it has been claimed that pupil size is a sensitive marker of mental-imagery vividness. We investigated this claim in three experiments, conducted in two countries (Norway and The Netherlands; Ntotal = 115), in which participants read, listened, or freely imagined stories that evoked a sense of darkness or brightness. In addition, participants rated their imagery vividness after each story, as a measure of moment-to-moment fluctuations in imagery; and their imagery vividness in general, as a measure of individual differences in imagery. Overall, we found that darkness-evoking stories induced larger pupils than brightness-evoking stories, although this effect was highly variable and only statistically reliable for longer (> 1 min) audio stories. Importantly, we consistently found that this pupil-size difference (dark - bright) was largest for vividly imagined stories. Finally, we did not find any relationship between this pupil-size difference and individual differences in general in imagery. We conclude that the strength of pupil-size changes in response to imagined darkness or brightness reflects moment-to-moment fluctuations in imagery vividness within an individual rather than individual differences in imagery vividness as a personal trait.",
