      "title": "Efficient genetic perturbation of murine sensory neurons in vivo using CRISPR/Cas9",
      "content": "Gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 in vivo offers a powerful tool to investigate pain mechanisms. We validated the use of conditional knock-in mouse model expressing Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR associated protein 9 selectively in sensory neurons by crossing with Scn10a-Cre driver. Transgene expression was confirmed in key tissues including the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and sciatic nerve. To assess in vivo editing efficacy, RNA guides targeting GFP or TRPV1 were intrathecally administered. A dose of micrograms of RNA guides significantly reduced GFP expression, and two rounds of nanoparticle delivery targeting TRPV1 resulted in ~65% reduction in DRG and ~55% in sciatic nerve without triggering caspase-3-mediated apoptosis or motor deficits. Edited animals exhibited increased withdrawal latencies to heat and reduced nocifensive behaviors following capsaicin injection. Their responses to capsaicin-evoked thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were diminished. This approach enables rapid and efficient sensory neuron-specific CRISPR/Cas9 gene perturbations for pain research in mice. We envisage that this method can be employed both for the exploration of molecular mechanisms underlying nociception and for the validation of therapeutic targets associated with pain.",

      "title": "Circadian and Sleep-Wake Modulation of Functional Connectivity Across Brain Oscillations and States Linked to Cognition in Humans",
      "content": "Sleep and circadian rhythms both contribute to cognitive performance, but the underlying neuronal network-level changes remain unclear. We quantified the contribution of brain state, sleep-pressure dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle, and circadian rhythmicity to electroencephalographic (EEG) functional connectivity (FC) and examined how these network changes relate to cognition. Thirty-four healthy adults completed a 10-day forced-desynchrony protocol to uncouple sleep-wake and endogenous circadian rhythms. From over 1,200 hours of artifact-free EEG, we derived phase-coupling metrics to quantify FC across brain states, thirds-of-the-night (sleep pressure), and circadian phase, and related these network measures to a range of cognitive performance indices. FC differed markedly between brain states, especially in the alpha and sigma bands, and was modulated by sleep history and circadian phase. Principal component analysis revealed both a global and a topographically distributed FC component which responded differentially to sleep pressure. Dissipation of sleep pressure was accompanied by increasing global FC in NREM sleep, and especially in the delta, sigma and beta frequencies, and decreasing global FC in the alpha band. During REM sleep, global FC decreased in nearly all frequency bands with dissipation of sleep pressure. The influence of circadian phase on FC was smaller than that of sleep pressure and varied across brain states. Lower global theta-band FC in NREM and alpha-band FC during wake predicted better alertness and working memory accuracy, an effect modulated by circadian phase. These results suggest that sleep homeostasis and circadian timing interact to stabilize functional brain connectivity in wakefulness, thereby supporting optimal cognitive function.",

      "content": "IntroductionTraditional methods for farmland road extraction, such as U-Net, often struggle with complex noise and geometric features, leading to discontinuous extraction and insufficient sensitivity. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel dual-phase generative adversarial network (GAN) named UHGAN, which integrates Hough-transform constraints.MethodsWe designed a cascaded U-Net generator within a two-stage GAN framework. The Stage 1 GAN combines a differentiable Hough transform loss with cross-entropy loss to generate initial road masks. Subsequently, the Stage 2 U-Net refines these masks by repairing breakpoints and suppressing isolated noise.ResultsWhen evaluated on the WHU RuR+rural road dataset, the proposed UHGAN method achieved an accuracy of 0.826, a recall of 0.750, and an F1-score of 0.789. This represents a significant improvement over the single-stage U-Net (F1\u202f=\u202f0.756) and ResNet (F1\u202f=\u202f0.762) baselines.DiscussionThe results demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the issues of discontinuous extraction caused by the complex geometric shapes and partial occlusion characteristic of farmland roads. The integration of Hough-transform loss, an technique that has received limited attention in prior studies, proves to be highly beneficial. This method shows considerable promise for practical applications in rural infrastructure planning and precision agriculture.",

      "content": "Introduction: Pudendal nerve stimulation is a promising therapy for urinary incontinence, however stimulation can evoke off-target activity. We aimed to determine whether multi-contact cuff electrodes can selectively recruit motor fibers of the pudendal nerve trunk in preclinical feline and ovine models. Methods: Multi-contact cuff electrodes were implanted around the pudendal nerve in anesthetized felines and ovines. Structured variations in electrode contact configurations and stimulation amplitudes were applied to evoke external urethral sphincter (EUS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) pressure responses. We calculated selectivity indices, EUS Scores, and EAS Scores to quantify selective recruitment and the magnitude of evoked pressure changes. Results: We achieved selective motor activation, with preferential recruitment of the EUS or EAS in all three feline experiments and one of three ovine experiments. In felines, at least four electrode combinations selectively evoked EUS responses (EUS Score 0.5) and at least one combination targeted the EAS. In ovines, one EUS-selective and six EAS-selective combinations obtained comparable scores. In preliminary tests, we observed functional increases in leak point pressure and incontinence prevention with selective stimulation. Conclusions: This study shows that multi-contact cuff electrodes can selectively activate EUS and EAS motor fibers in the pudendal nerve. Future work should focus on optimizing stimulation parameters to enhance selectivity and assess the translational potential of this approach for restoring pelvic organ control.",

Even if you restrict yourself to 3.11 you <em>also</em> have to go back to pip &lt;24.1 because of how some package requirements are written. I've looked around and can't find any other orbital dynamics libraries that are more than personal projects.
