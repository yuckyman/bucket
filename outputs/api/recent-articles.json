      "title": "Aging reveals divergent responses of AgRP/NPY neurons to diet in male and female mice.",
      "content": "Objectives: Neurons coexpressing Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) are an essential component of an interoceptive circuit regulating hunger and metabolism. Their activity is closely linked to metabolic state and their output is sensitive to diet-induced plasticity, which may influence the development of obesity and associated metabolic diseases. However, most studies use young male mice, even though obesity and its comorbidities are sensitive to both biological sex and aging, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of the role of these neurons in females and in older animals. Our goal was to begin to address this gap by investigating the effects of diet and age on AgRP/NPY neuronal activity in female mice in both early adulthood and midlife. Methods: Female transgenic NPY-GFP mice aged 8-32 weeks were fed either a standard control chow diet or a high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFD) for 8-24 weeks and brain slice patch clamp electrophysiology was used to measure the response of AgRP/NPY neurons. Results: We found that in young, lean female mice, the baseline firing rate of AgRP/NPY neurons is significantly elevated compared to age-matched males, thus the impact of HFD on the output of these neurons is blunted relative to control. However, in the baseline firing rate of neurons from lean middle-aged female mice is significantly lower, resulting in a greater relative impact of HFD on AgRP/NPY neuronal output, the development of neuronal leptin resistance, and significant weight gain. Conclusions: Both sex and age significantly impact the function and modulation of AgRP/NPY neurons, emphasizing the need to include these biological variables in experimental design.",

      "content": "The muscarinic agonist xanomeline in combination with the peripherally restricted muscarinic antagonist trospium has recently been approved for treatment of schizophrenia. Xanomeline represents the first approved antipsychotic drug without apparent activity at D2-dopamine receptors. In humans, xanomeline is reported to be metabolized to N-desmethylxanomeline, which has a similar pharmacokinetic profile to xanomeline, although its pharmacology has not been reported. We discovered that xanomeline and N-desmethylxanomeline have potent agonist and antagonist actions at many biogenic amine G protein coupled receptors. These results suggest that at least some of the actions of xanomeline and N-desmethylxanomeline could be mediated by off-target actions at serotonergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic and other receptors. We discuss the potential implications of these findings.",

      "title": "Impact of chronic alcohol and stress on mid-life cognition and locus coeruleus integrity",
      "content": "Background: Excessive alcohol consumption and stress are associated with structural and functional alterations in the brain and impaired cognition. However, the persistence of long-term neural impacts after alcohol and stress are less understood. This study investigated midlife cognition and neuropathological changes following a history of alcohol and stress exposure. Methods: C57BL/6J mice acclimated to ethanol drinking (15% v/v) before exposure to four cycles of alternating chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure and repeated forced swim stress (FSS), with control groups exposed to air and no stress (AIR/NS). After three months of abstinence, mice were evaluated at midlife (11 months old) on volitional drinking and a final CIE/FSS challenge for stress induced drinking. Spatial learning and cognitive flexibility were assessed using the Barnes maze before brains were collected to evaluate locus coeruleus integrity at 12 months old. Results: CIE/FSS increased volitional alcohol intake, and this drinking phenotype persisted through to midlife despite extended abstinence. CIE/FSS mice showed intact spatial learning but impaired flexibility in the Barnes maze reversal phase. Flexibility impairments were driven by decreased time in the target quadrant and increased errors during the reversal test compared to AIR/NS. Furthermore, CIE/FSS mice showed pathological measures of reduced locus coeruleus integrity common to dementia related disorders, including elevated markers of oxidative stress, apoptosis and reduced autoinhibitory function. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the long-lasting impact of alcohol and stress exposure on cognition, with flexibility impairments persisting into midlife. In addition to cognitive changes, alcohol and stress history produced pathological changes in the locus coeruleus, an area known to mediate cognitive flexibility via its forebrain projections. Together, these results give an insight into the long-lasting impacts of chronic alcohol and stress and how they may accelerate age-related cognitive decline.",

      "content": "Functional interactions between brain regions are often inferred from multi-region models fit to neural activity recorded in behaving animals. Here, we show that inference of across-region interactions is hindered by the wide breadth of model fits consistent with naturally occurring neural activity. In contrast, models fit to activity that includes region-wide activity perturbations provide well-constrained estimates of across-region interactions; simulations suggest these estimates can be accurate.",

      "content": "Objective: Using a go/no-go test, we showed that end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients have a slower average reaction time (RT) compared with their respective controls. This study aimed to investigate whether the RT of ESKD patients worsened throughout the test and whether RTs were influenced by target frequencies (TF) or the speed of stimulus presentation. Method: A total of 110 ESKD patients and 109 age- and sex-matched controls were selected (<em>M<sub>age</sub></em> = 50.2 \u00b1 12.07 years for patients and 47.8 \u00b1 14.21 years for controls). Participants completed a go/no-go test, assessing attentional subdomains through four variables: omission errors (focus), commission errors (inhibition), RT (intrinsic alertness), and variability of RT (sustained attention). The test lasted approximately 15 min and was divided into three consecutive, equally spaced time sets (first, second, third). Each set was subdivided into two blocks: one with a high TF (80%) and the other with a low TF (20%). Each block was subdivided into three different interstimulus time intervals (low, medium, and high speeds). Both groups performed the test simultaneously at dialysis centers, with ESKD patients completing it 68 hr after their last dialysis session. Results: ESKD patients consistently demonstrated slower RTs than controls throughout the 15-min task. The average difference in RT between the groups did not increase over time and was independent of TF. Notably, RT was significantly slower in ESKD patients only when stimuli were presented at the highest speed. Conclusions: ESKD patients exhibited specifically impaired alertness when responding to visual stimuli presented at the highest speed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "title": "Dissociation between physical reasoning and tool use in individuals with left hemisphere brain damage",
      "content": "Many everyday tasks, from chopping vegetables to catching a ball, require understanding both how objects respond to physical forces and how to use them effectively. These capacities, tool use and physical reasoning, are often assumed to rely on shared cognitive and neural mechanisms. At some level, this correspondence is expected: using an object typically requires understanding its physical properties. However, both capacities are complex and multicomponential, so the relationship between them may vary across levels of representation and task demands. Here, we asked whether third-person physical reasoning about object dynamics can dissociate from tool use (i.e., performing a tool's typical action, such as using a hammer to drive a nail) in individuals with left-hemisphere stroke. We tested 11 patients, five of whom showed impairments in tool use. Physical reasoning was assessed using a novel collection of tasks probing judgments about mass, velocity, and timing across static and dynamic scenes. Tool use was evaluated using a classic gesture-to-sight task, a pantomime-based measure in which participants are shown pictures of familiar tools and asked to demonstrate how each would be used. We identified an individual-level dissociation: patient I.A. showed impairment in gesturing the use of objects despite preserved physical reasoning, often outperforming neurotypical controls. This pattern was complemented by patient N.P., who showed the reverse profile, with intact tool use gestures but difficulties in some physical reasoning tasks. These findings suggest that the ability to reason about the physical world and tool use can dissociate behaviorally and be independently disrupted by brain damage. This challenges the view that physical reasoning and tool use draw on the same underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms and suggests that at least some of their components are distinct.",

      "title": "Genetic dissection of microglia cannibalism reveals an IL10 signaling axis controls microglia lifespan",
      "content": "The development of complex organs, like the brain, demands a robust system for tissue remodeling and cellular debris clearance. In the brain, this function is performed by microglia, which must clear diverse debris substrates, including that caused by cell death. Although the subsequent fate of these phagocytic microglia is a critical regulatory point that impacts whether the brain resolves a debris environment, the genetic mechanisms that control microglia fate after debris clearance remain mostly unknown. To address this, we conducted a large-scale CRISPR screen in zebrafish using a custom-built robotic confocal microscope. We selected candidate genes from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of embryonic mouse microglia. This screen identified several modulators of microglial lifespan and cannibalism that are enriched in mouse and zebrafish microglia, including interleukin-10 receptor beta (il10rb), a receptor subunit for the cytokine IL10. Perturbation of il10, il10rb, and downstream signaling molecules JAK/STAT in zebrafish reduced microglial death. Expression analysis in mouse and zebrafish confirmed that microglia express both il10 and il10rb. Given the established role of IL10 in lysosomal remodeling, we hypothesized that it regulates microglial survival through lysosomal acidification. While il10rb perturbation did not alter lysosome number or size, it caused a significant reduction in LysoTracker-positive lysosomes, indicating decreased lysosomal acidification. Inhibiting v-ATPase also reduced microglial death, reinforcing the link between lysosomal pH and cell fate. Our findings reveal a cytokine-regulated mechanism where lysosomal dynamics determine the survival of phagocytic microglia. We propose that a necroptosis-cannibalism process functions as a quality control mechanism for microglial turnover, which is critical for refining neuroimmune cell function in the brain.",

      "title": "Validation of immersive virtual reality line and baguette bisection tasks for the assessment of unilateral spatial neglect.",
      "content": "Objective: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) assessment is commonly based on paper-and-pencil tests, including the line bisection task. However, this task lacks sensitivity and does not reflect the symptomatic heterogeneity of USN patients, such as difficulties in extrapersonal space or encountered in daily life. Immersive virtual reality (VR) could be a promising way to improve the line bisection task by developing versions that better reflect the difficulties experienced by patients. This study investigated the feasibility and the psychometric qualities of different immersive VR bisection tasks. Method: 22 right-brain damaged patients with confirmed left USN (USN++) on conventional USN assessment tools, signs of left USN (USN+), or without USN (USN\u2212), and 39 healthy participants were recruited and performed three different immersive VR bisection tasks\u2014a proximal and a distal line bisection task and an ecological baguette bisection task. Results: Correlational analyses with conventional USN assessment tools supported the validity of the immersive VR bisection tasks. Group and individual analyses emphasized the better sensitivity of the immersive VR proximal and ecological tasks compared with the paper-and-pencil line bisection task. The immersive VR proximal bisection task showed high sensitivity to detecting USN++ patients (detection rate: 75.0%) but not USN+ patients, while the immersive VR ecological bisection task showed good sensitivity for detecting both (detection rate: 62.5%), supporting its relevance for diagnosing mild USN. Conclusions: The immersive VR bisection tasks appear relevant for USN diagnosis, especially the ecological one, which supports the need for more ecological assessment tools to assess USN and plan rehabilitation better.

      "content": "Objective: The Reading of the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is widely used to assess theory of mind, but its validity has recently been questioned. This study aimed to present a refined Spanish version of the test and examine its psychometric properties. Method: A total of 1,185 participants from Colombia completed the Spanish RMET. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine its internal structure. Item response theory was applied to evaluate item quality. A test\u2013retest analysis was performed, and standardization norms were developed for urban Colombian adults. Results: A refined 24-item version (RMET-24) is proposed, retaining items from the original 36-item test. Twelve items were excluded due to poor discrimination and evidence of guessing, as indicated by item response theory. The RMET-24 showed a unifactorial structure with suitable difficulty and discrimination indices, adequate test\u2013retest stability, and satisfactory reliability. Scoring norms for the Colombian sample were established using linear regression. Conclusions: The RMET-24 offers improved psychometric properties over the original version. Its refined indices make it appropriate for clinical populations. While suitable for neuropsychological assessments, future updates should consider incorporating color stimuli.

      "title": "Updating the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale to <em>DSM-5</em>-TR/<em>ICD-11</em>: A new item-division based on the current neurocognitive domains.",
      "content": "Objective: The Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS), a widely used cognitive assessment tool, has been revised to align with contemporary diagnostic criteria and cognitive domain classifications such as those outlined in <em>Diagnostic Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</em>, fifth edition\u2013text revision (DSM-5-TR) and <em>eleventh version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11).</em> This study proposed a reorganization of DRS items into five new subscales based on cognitive domains of those classificatory manuals, aiming to enhance its construct validity and clinical utility. Method: The DRS and other neuropsychological tests were used for the assessment of 407 older adults with low formal education and heterogeneous cognitive backgrounds. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test different arrangements of DRS items and correlated the final model with other neuropsychological tests. Results: Our final model (following the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> cognitive domains) showed better model fit in multiple indexes when compared with the original DRS subscales. They showed significant correlation with specific neuropsychological tests corresponding to their respective cognitive domains, supporting its validity. Group comparisons across cognitive impairment levels (cognitively unimpaired, mild neurocognitive disorder, major neurocognitive disorder) revealed progressive cognitive decline patterns consistent with clinical expectations. Conclusions: The proposed DRS item division based in <em>DSM-5-TR</em> and<em> ICD-11</em> cognitive domains showed more consistent evidences of validity than the original. The proposed revision can use the original DRS subtests and scoring system, just reorganizing the subscales to better fit the <em>DSM-5-TR/ICD-11</em> model and can in any translation/local version of the test. Further research is needed to replicate this findings and establish normative values and cutoff scores for clinical application. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",
