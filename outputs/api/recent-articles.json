      "title": "Emotional Responses to Naturalistic and AI-generated Affective Pictures: A Systematic Comparison",
      "content": "Pictures depicting naturalistic scenes are widely used in studies of human emotion. However, the practical use of affective pictures is limited by several factors, including the difficulty of obtaining content-diverse, high-quality, openly accessible, and standardized stimuli that are necessary for specific research questions. The use of artificially generated (AI) pictures could address this limitation, but it is unclear if AI-generated pictures evoke reliable emotional responses. The present study sought to address these challenges by comparing emotional responses to AI-generated pictures with responses to original, standardized, pictures. In two study iterations, standardized pictures containing pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant content were selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and other sources. Then, a matched AI-counterpart was created for each original picture using generative deep neural networks. A total of 109 participants viewed the picture sets while pupil diameter and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Evaluative ratings of hedonic valence and emotional arousal were also collected. For both AI and original exemplars, pictures depicting emotional content elicited stronger responses than neutral content for ratings and EEG-derived variables, with weaker effect sizes for the AI-generated pictures. Furthermore, picture-level analyses found that ratings and EEG measures were strongly correlated between matched AI and original pictures. Pupil data also showed the expected content effects in study iteration 2, but not in iteration 1. Together, this initial study suggests that AI-generated picture sets can effectively elicit well-established self-reported affect and physiological responses, presenting a promising avenue for future studies of human emotion.",

      "title": "Ablation of microglial estrogen receptor alpha predisposes to diet-induced obesity in male mice",
      "content": "Estrogen receptor alpha (ER) signaling has metabolic and anti-inflammatory properties in addition to its impact on reproductive function. In male but not female mice, inflammatory activation of microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity (DIO), raising the possibility that differences in microglial estrogen signaling may account for the sexual dimorphism. In this study, we assessed metabolic and CNS histopathological properties in a mouse model with inducible microglia-specific ablation of ER (MG-ERKO). Male MG-ERKO mice developed increased weight gain and insulin resistance relative to controls during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Indirect calorimetry analysis revealed that reduced energy expenditure was the main driver of the obese phenotype. In contrast, female MG-ERKO mice fed HFD developed mild insulin resistance with no change in body weight gain compared to controls. Immunohistochemical analyses of the microglial activation marker IBA1 in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) revealed that female MG-ERKO mice had increased number of microglia without showing morphological signs of activation. In contrast, MBH microglial number was unchanged in MG-ERKO male mice, but the cells adopted more activated morphological profiles. Finally, HFD-fed MG-ERKO male mice had increased POMC neuron-microglia interactions but fewer overall hypothalamic POMC neurons, suggesting microglia may disrupt POMC neuron integrity to promote DIO. Together, these findings indicate that sex-specific actions of estrogen in microglia limit the metabolic complications of HFD feeding.",

      "title": "Decoding saccadic eye movements from brain signals using an endovascular neural interface",
      "content": "Objective. An oculomotor brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) records neural activity from brain regions involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful studies have relied on invasive implants in non-human primates or electrooculography artefacts in human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, this study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular StentrodeTM device implanted near the supplementary motor area of a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Approach. One participant performed self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks in four directions (left, right, up, down) while endovascular EEG and eye gaze recordings were collected. Visually-guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. Brain signals were pre-processed to remove cardiac artefacts, downsampled, and classified using a Random Forest algorithm. For saccade onset classification (fixation vs saccade), features in time and frequency domains were extracted after xDAWN denoising, while for saccade direction classification, the downsampled time series were classified directly without explicit feature extraction. Main results. The neural responses of visually-guided saccades overlapped with cue-evoked potentials, while free-viewing saccades exhibited saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50\u2009ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200\u2009ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15\u2009Hz. Saccade onset classification was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 across sessions. Saccade direction decoding yielded within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best performing binary comparisons (left vs up and left vs down). Significance. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in a patient with ALS, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.",

In recent years, there has been a shift toward relying...",

      "content": "Recent technological developments have brought optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) within reach of the larger neuroscientific community. The current state-of-the-art consists of whole-head systems that measure the magnetic field at >100 locations. OPM sensors can be constructed to measure the field in either 1, 2, or 3 orientations. Consequently, the number of channels can differ from the number of sensors. This allows for magnetoencephalography (MEG) system designs with multiple measurement...",

      "content": "As aquaculture expands to meet global food demand, it remains dependent on manual, costly, infrequent, and high-risk operations due to reliance on high-end Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs). Scalable and autonomous systems are needed to enable safer and more efficient practices. This paper proposes a cost-effective autonomous inspection framework for the monitoring of mooring systems, a critical component ensuring structural integrity and regulatory compliance for both the aquaculture and...",

Cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness, accounting for over 75% of cases. While volunteer cataract surgery programs operate throughout the country, resource limitations often preclude comprehensive pre- and post-operative assessments, including standardized visual function testing.
