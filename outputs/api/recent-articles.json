      "content": "This study examined whether rapid eye movement (REM) sleep mentation provides more pertinent material for dream interpretation compared to non-REM (NREM) sleep mentation. Seventeen participants spent three consecutive nights at a sleep laboratory, where awakenings were scheduled to collect dream reports from both REM and NREM sleep. Participants interpreted their dreams using guided questions based on the Hill cognitive-experiential model. External judges evaluated dreamers\u2019 insight and the interpretation process. Results indicated that REM dream reports contained significantly longer and more complex narratives compared to NREM dream reports. Participants did not generate more associations from REM dreams than from NREM dreams; however, they derived more meaningful insight from REM dreams. Additionally, participants were significantly more likely to report gaining inspiration or solving problems through REM dreams than through NREM dreams, with a moderate effect size.

      "title": "Measuring dream recall frequency with questionnaire scales and diaries: Reliability and validity.",
      "content": "Research has demonstrated that we very likely dream every night in every sleep stage; however, the ability to recall a dream upon awakening shows large interindividual as well as intraindividual differences. Over the years, researchers studied the reliability and validity of different dream recall measures. In this study, 81 persons (59 women, 22 men) with a mean age of 24.44 \u00b1 8.49 years completed four different retrospective measures of dream recall and a dream diary over a 4-week period. The findings indicate that all dream recall measures (retrospective and prospective) showed high intercorrelations. As all retrospective measuring (last night, last week, last 28 days) yielded comparable estimates of dream recall frequency, it can be argued that underestimation due to memory might be rather small. In addition, we found the expected logbook enhancement effect, that is, dream recall increased during the 4-week period keeping the diary. The internal consistency (reliability of measuring interindividual differences in dream recall with diaries) was sufficiently high for a 2-week period and very high for the 4-week interval. Lastly, the frequency of \u201cwhite dreams\u201d was not related to the retrospectively elicited dream recall frequency and, thus, indicates that participants do not include \u201cwhite dreaming\u201d in their dream recall frequency estimates.

      "content": "The goal of this study attempts to explore the differences in attitude toward dreams and their possible cultural causes between Han (the majority ethnicity in China) and Miao ethnicity by comparing the dreams from these two groups. Both quantitative (Attitude Towards Dreams Scale and Typical Dream Questionnaire) and qualitative analysis of dream contents have been utilized to explore the dreams of Han and Miao college students in Guizhou Province, where the largest percentage of the Miao ethnic group in the world now resides. The results showed that: (a) There is a significant difference in the themes of typical dreams from Miao and Han college students, which is related to geographical and cultural factors. (b) Miao college students generally have richer dream contents, but a more peaceful attitude toward dreams; this is likely because they have more psychological resources; therefore, dreams are mostly viewed as only one of the channels for them to communicate with their ancestors and nature. Compared to their Han counterparts, Miao college students have more psychological resources because of their cultural identity. The Miao ethnic group\u2019s unique culture is ever present in their unconscious, allowing for more ordinary attitudes toward their dreams.

      "title": "Cultural influences on dream: A comparative study of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations.",
      "content": "This study sought to compare the dream experiences of Tibetan and Han Chinese populations by employing the Attitudes Toward Dreams Scale, Dream Intensity Scale, and Frequency of Dream Sharing Scale, with a focus on analyzing the influence of cultural differences on these dimensions. The sample comprised 311 Tibetan and 320 Han Chinese participants. The results revealed that Tibetans demonstrated more positive attitudes toward dreams, experienced dreams with greater intensity, and shared dreams more frequently than Han Chinese. Moreover, the attitudes of the Tibetans toward dreams were more indicative of dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing compared to Han Chinese. Additionally, dream intensity completely mediated in the relationship between attitudes toward dreams and the frequency of dream sharing in both Tibetan and Han Chinese populations. The findings indicate that different cultural contexts demonstrate unique attitudes toward dreams, including variations in dream intensity and the frequency of dream sharing. The Tibetan population, closely intertwined with nature and characterized by a unified set of religious beliefs, such as Tibetan Buddhism, likely has heightened positive perceptions of dreams. This is reflected in their elevated attitudes toward dreams, increased dream intensity, and more frequent dream sharing, as well as a stronger interconnection among these dimensions. Conversely, the Han Chinese, characterized by their widespread distribution and diverse religious beliefs, tend to prioritize material reality over spiritual practices such as dreaming, especially in the context of rapid urban development. These findings shed light on the cultural influences on dreaming. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)",

      "content": "The Misioneros del Temporal is an agricultural community of \u201critual specialists\u201d located in the state of Morelos, Mexico. For this community, dream content serves as a bridge between individual experiences and collective life, linking the ecological environment with their cosmovision. Dreams function both as a means of communication with the divine and as tools for ritual action. This research is based on semistructured interviews, participation in rituals, and participant observation. Additionally, a domain analysis was conducted, with results presented that illustrate the relationship between the most common dreams, their meanings, and associated ritual actions. The study further describes the dynamics through which dreams are shared within the community. The findings suggest that dreams become public forms through their narration and gain meaning through the community\u2019s underlying cosmovision and collective validation. From a cognitive anthropology perspective, this study emphasizes the importance of analyzing the social, cultural, and ecological contexts in which these forms of knowledge emerge. It also highlights the need for dialogue with the individuals involved to better understand the processes of knowledge generation, transmission, and ritual action.

      "content": "This article comprises two parts. Part I deals with Augustine Nwoye\u2019s classification of dreams in Africa, a theoretical background that has been used here purposively to explain the significance of dreams and dreaming to the Luo people in Kenya. This article is therefore deliberately anchored on Nwoye\u2019s African theoretical framework on dreams and dreaming. Part II of this article examines different types of dreams from the cultural perspective of the Luo traditional community, dreams that exemplify Nwoye\u2019s tripartite division of dreams and their sources. This article is particularly concerned with the meaning and significance of dreams and dreaming and what cultural practices and beliefs about dreams and dreaming might reveal about the ethical, epistemological, and metaphysical worldview of the Luo. Culturally, dreams serve various functions such as: sourcing names, counseling, healing, communication with ancestral spirits, mourning, solving personal and societal problems, prediction, divination, and fortune-telling, among many other pertinent issues. Dreams have social, cultural, epistemological, and metaphysical functions. These functions have been articulated in this article, \u201cThe Significance of Dreams and Dreaming.\u201d This article is one among only a few publications on the topic concerning the value of dreams and dreaming in the beliefs, customs, traditions, and beliefs of this community, the Luo in Kenya.

      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><ul> <li><strong>What My Project Does</strong></li> </ul> <p>The Zero-ology team recently tackled a high-precision computational challenge at the intersection of HPC, algorithmic engineering, and complex algebraic geometry. We developed the <strong>Grand Constant Aggregator (GCA)</strong> framework -- a fully reproducible computational tool designed to generate <strong>numerical evidence</strong> for the <strong>Hodge Conjecture</strong> on <strong>K3 surfaces</strong> ran in a Python script.</p> <p>The core challenge is establishing formal certificates of numerical linear independence at an unprecedented scale. GCA systematically compares known transcendental periods against a canonically generated set of \u03c1 real numbers, called the <strong>Grand Constants</strong>, for K3 surfaces of Picard rank \u03c1 \u2208 {1,10,16,18,20}.</p> <p>The GCA Framework's core thesis is a computationally driven attempt to provide overwhelming numerical support for the Hodge Conjecture, specifically for five chosen families of K3 surfaces (Picard ranks 1, 10, 16, 18, 20).</p> <p>The primary mechanism is a test for linear independence using the PSLQ algorithm.</p> <p>The Target Relation: The standard Hodge Conjecture requires showing that the transcendental period $(\\omega)$ of a cycle is linearly dependent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (rational numbers) on the periods of the <em>actual</em> algebraic cycles ($\\alpha_j$).</p> <p>The GCA Substitution: The framework substitutes the unknown periods of the algebraic cycles ($\\alpha_j$) with a set of synthetically generated, highly-reproducible, transcendental numbers, called the <strong>Grand Constants</strong> ($\\mathcal{C}_j$), produced by the <strong>Grand Constant Aggregator (GCA)</strong> formula.</p> <p>The Test: The framework tests for an integer linear dependence relation among the set $(\\omega, \\mathcal{C}_1, \\mathcal{C}_2, \\dots, \\mathcal{C}_\\rho)$.</p> <p>The observed failure of PSLQ to find a relation suggests that the period $\\omega$ is numerically independent of the GCA constants $\\mathcal{C}_j$.</p> <p>-Generating these certificates required deterministic reproducibility across arbitrary hardware.</p> <p>-Every test had to be machine-verifiable while maintaining extremely high precision.</p> <p>For Algorithmic and Precision Details we rely on the PSLQ algorithm (via Python's mpmath) to search for integer relations between complex numbers. Calculations were pushed to 4000-digit precision with an error tolerance of 10^-3900.</p> <p>This extreme precision tests the limits of standard arbitrary-precision libraries, requiring careful memory management and reproducible hash-based constants.</p> <h1><a href=\"https://github.com/haha8888haha8888/Zer00logy/blob/main/hodge_GCA.py\">hodge_GCA.py</a> Results</h1> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Surface Family</th> <th align=\"left\">Picard Rank \u03c1</th> <th align=\"left\">Transcendental Period \u03c9</th> <th align=\"left\">PSLQ Outcome (4000 digits)</th> </tr> </thead><tbody> <tr> <td align=\"left\"></td> <td align=\"left\" colspan=\"3\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Fermat quartic</td> <td align=\"left\">20</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Kummer (CM by \u221a\u22127)</td> <td align=\"left\">18</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Generic Kummer</td> <td align=\"left\">16</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Double sextic</td> <td align=\"left\">10</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/4)\u2074 / (4\u03c0\u00b2)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=\"left\">Quartic with one line</td> <td align=\"left\">1</td> <td align=\"left\">\u0393(1/3)\u2076 / (4\u03c0\u00b3)</td> <td align=\"left\">NO RELATION</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p>Every test confirmed no integer relations detected, demonstrating the consistency and reproducibility of the GCA framework. While GCA produces strong heuristic evidence, bridging the remaining gap to a formal Clay-level proof requires:</p> <p>--Computing exact algebraic cycle periods.<br /> ---Verifying the Picard lattice symbolically.<br /> ----Scaling symbolic computations to handle full transcendental precision.</p> <p><strong>The GCA is the Numerical Evidence:</strong> The GCA framework provides &quot;the strongest uniform computational evidence&quot; by using the PSLQ algorithm to numerically confirm that no integer relation exists up to 4,000 digits. It explicitly states: &quot;We emphasize that this framework is heuristic: it does not constitute a formal proof acceptable to the Clay Mathematics Institute.&quot;</p> <p>The use of the PSLQ algorithm at an unprecedented 4000-digit precision (and a tolerance of $10^{-3900}$) for these transcendental relations is a remarkable computational feat. The higher the precision, the stronger the conviction that a small-integer relation truly does not exist.</p> <p><strong>Proof vs. Heuristic:</strong> proving that $\\omega$ is independent of the <em>GCA constants</em> is mathematically irrelevant to the Hodge Conjecture unless one can prove a link between the GCA constants and the true periods. This makes the result a compelling piece of heuristic evidence <strong>--</strong> it increases confidence in the conjecture by failing to find a relation with a highly independent set of constants -- but it <strong>does not constitute a formal proof</strong> that would be accepted by the Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI), it could possibly be completed with a Team with the correct instruments and equipment.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Algebra</strong><br /> The Algebraic Structure, It defines the universal, infinite, self-generating algebra of all possible mathematical constants ($\\mathcal{G}_n$).

It is the reproducible $\\text{hash-based algorithm}$ used to generate a <em>specific subset</em> of $\\mathcal{G}_n$ constants ($\\mathcal{C}_j$) needed for a particular application, such as the numerical testing of the Hodge Conjecture.</p> <p>The <strong>Aggregator</strong> dictates the structure of the <strong>vector</strong> that must admit a non-trivial integer relation. The goal is to find a vector of integers $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_\\rho)$ such that:</p> <p>$$\\sum_{i=0}^{\\rho} a_i \\cdot \\text{Period}_i = 0$$</p> <ul> <li><strong>Comparison</strong></li> </ul> <p>Most computational work related to the Hodge Conjecture focuses on either:</p> <p>Symbolic methods (Magma, SageMath, PARI/GP): These typically compute exact algebraic cycle lattices, Picard ranks, and polynomial invariants using fully symbolic algebra. They do not attempt large-scale transcendental PSLQ tests at thousands of digits.</p> <p>Period computation frameworks (numerical integration of differential forms): These compute transcendental periods for specific varieties but rarely push integer-relation detection beyond a few hundred digits, and almost never attempt uniform tests across multiple K3 families.</p> <p>Low-precision PSLQ / heuristic checks: PSLQ is widely used to detect integer relations among constants, but almost all published work uses 100\u2013300 digits, far below true heuristic-evidence territory.</p> <p><strong>Grand Constant Aggregator</strong> is fundamentally different:</p> <p>Uniformity: Instead of computing periods case-by-case, GCA introduces the <em>Grand Constants</em>, a reproducible, hash-generated constant basis that works identically for any K3 surface with Picard rank \u03c1.</p> <p>Scale: GCA pushes PSLQ to 4000 digits with a staggering 10\u207b\u00b3\u2079\u2070\u2070 tolerance, far above typical computational methods in algebraic geometry.</p> <p>Hardware-independent reproducibility: 4000 digit numeric proof ran in python on a laptop.</p> <p>Cross-family verification: Instead of testing one K3 surface in isolation, GCA performs a five-family sweep across Picard ranks {1, 10, 16, 18, 20}, each requiring different transcendental structures.</p> <p><strong>Open-source</strong> commercial license: Very few computational frameworks for transcendental geometry are fully open and commercially usable. GCA encourages verification and extension by outside HPC teams, startups, and academic researchers.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Target Audience</strong> </li> </ul> <p>This next stage is an HPC-level challenge, likely requiring supercomputing resources and specialized systems like Magma or SageMath, combined with high-precision arithmetic.</p> <p>To support this community, the entire framework is fully open-source and commercially usable with attribution, enabling external HPC groups, academic labs, and independent researchers to verify, extend, or reinterpret the results. The work highlights algorithmic design and high-performance optimization as equal pillars of the project, showing how careful engineering can stabilize transcendental computations well beyond typical limits. </p> <p>The entire framework is fully <strong>open-source</strong> and licensed for commercial use with proper attribution, allowing other computational teams to verify, reproduce, and extend the results. The work emphasizes algorithmic engineering, HPC optimization, and reproducibility at extreme numerical scales, demonstrating how modern computational techniques can rigorously support investigations in complex algebraic geometry.</p> <p>We hope this demonstrates what modern computational mathematics can achieve and sparks discussion on algorithmic engineering approaches to classic problems and we can expand the Grand constant Aggregator and possibly proof the Hodge Conjecture. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zero_moo-s\"> /u/zero_moo-s </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p44cr8/python_numerical_evidence_max_pslq_to_4000_digits/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p44cr8/python_numerical_evidence_max_pslq_to_4000_digits/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "content": "<p>RealDeed is MENA\u2019s advanced real estate tokenization platform, licensed under the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC).<p>Our mission is simple: Make real estate \u201cdigitally alive\u201d without forcing property owners or developers into securities, fundraising, or STO regulations on day one.<p>Real estate globally is still stuck in PDFs, local land offices, and offline processes. Tokenization exists, but almost all solutions jump straight into securities, fractionalization, investor pooling, and STOs, which triggers regulation and makes experimentation nearly impossible.<p>We built RealDeed because property owners kept asking us the same question:<p>\u201cCan I put my real estate on blockchain as a digital twin without selling ownership or offering securities?\u201d<p>So that\u2019s exactly what we built.<p>Today, we\u2019re launching the RealDeed \u2014 a platform that turns physical real estate into digital assets or twins, represented as utility tokens pegged to land area.<p>What RealDeed Actually Does :.<p>RealDeed allows property owners and developers to:<p>1. Upload property documents<p>Title deed, floor plan, DLD or RERA documents, etc.<p>2. Verify ownership<p>KYC + property verification.<p>3. Define a tokenization model<p>Example:\n32 sqm \u2192 320,000 utility tokens\n120 sqm \u2192 1,200,000 tokens<p>Tokens represent digital land, not ownership.<p>4. Mint the digital twin on-chain<p>We generate tokens on XRP Ledger & EVM networks.<p>5. Deliver tokens to the owner\u2019s Web3 wallet\n6. Optional integrations<p>Where legally allowed, owners can connect their digital twins to:<p>Broker-dealer platforms<p>DeFi platforms<p>Fintech apps<p>Metaverse/spatial systems<p>Partner proptech tools<p>RealDeed creates the first interoperable property layer on blockchain where:<p>A Dubai villa<p>A Mumbai apartment<p>A London flat<p>\u2026can all exist as standardized digital twins\u2014usable across APIs, developer tools, and digital ecosystems.<p>This enables:<p>Global property mapping<p>Unified digital registries<p>Digital twin trading like gift deed and selling tokens(not property trading)<p>Cross-border developer collaboration<p>Blockchains finally have a way to \u201cunderstand\u201d property.<p>Regulatory Positioning<p>RealDeed is:Licensed under DIFC Innovation Licence (PropTech/DLT & Tokenization)<p>(we don\u2019t do financial services)<p>Not a securities platform<p>Not selling tokens<p>Not accepting public funds<p>Not fractional ownership<p>Think of us as \u201cStripe for property tokenization.\u201d<p>Founded by Malhar Jajoo & Pratz (Prathmesh)<p>Try It / Join the Waitlist<p>realdeed.co</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46018107\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46018107</a></p>\n<p>Points: 5</p>\n<p># Comments: 2</p>",

Before this workflow (and now, this tool), I kept getting \"close but not quite\" results from AI coding tools. I learned that the more context & guidance I gave these tools up front, the better results I got.<p>The other thing I have found with most tools that attempt to improve on \"vibe coding\" is that they add abstraction. To me, this just adds to the problem. AI coding agents are valuable, but they are error-prone - you need to be an active participation in their work. This workflow is designed to provide a scaffolding for these AI agents, while minimizing additional abstraction.<p>Would love feedback on the workflow - especially curious if others find the upfront planning helpful or constraining.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46018229\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46018229</a></p>\n<p>Points: 4</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",
