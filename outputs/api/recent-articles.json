      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cause of stroke that may mimic other intracranial disorders. A 32-year-old male with bipolar disorder and prior venous thromboembolism presented with severe occipital headache, progressive blurred vision, and a brief sensory episode. He reported recent chronic nitrous oxide use. Imaging revealed extensive thrombosis of the superior sagittal, bilateral transverse, and sigmoid sinuses with venous congestion but no infarction. Laboratory studies...",

Methods: This was a retrospective study of patients after segmental buckling, circumferential buckling, primary vitrectomy, or combined surgery (vitrectomy and scleral buckling) in whom SS-OCTA was performed at 1 month and 24 months after surgery. Central retinal thickness, central choroidal thickness visual acuity, macula-on vs...",

Although deep learning methods have integrated various perceptual capabilities and achieved remarkable progress, their high computational cost limits practical deployment under resource-constrained conditions. Moreover, when confronted with diverse degradation types, existing methods often fail to effectively model the inconsistent attenuation across color channels and spatial regions....",
