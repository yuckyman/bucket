      "title": "Altered NPTX2 dynamics associated with impaired cognitive aging",
      "content": "Changes in synaptic integrity and neural activity homeostasis are hallmarks of brain aging and are closely tied to cognitive outcomes. Yet, defining their relationship across the continuum from normal aging to neurodegenerative disease has proven challenging. Recent research investigating the dynamic changes of neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2, or Narp, neuronal activity-related pentraxin) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects supports its promise as a prognostic marker of disease progression, possibly as an expression of synaptic damage related to cognitive impairment. However, studies in human subjects are unable to clearly differentiate age-related and disease-related processes. Here we took advantage of a well-characterized rat model that displays substantial individual differences in hippocampal memory during aging, uncontaminated by slowly progressive, spontaneous neurodegenerative disease. Through this approach, we aimed to interrogate the underlying neural substrates that mediate aging as a uniquely permissive condition and the primary risk for neurodegeneration. We found that successful cognitive aging is associated with an elevation of NPTX2 levels above that found in young or cognitively impaired subjects. Pharmacological engagement of neural activity was sufficient to increase NPTX2 levels in all subjects, but cognitively-impaired aged subjects failed to recruit NPTX2 in response to a hippocampus-dependent memory task. Together the findings demonstrate that changes in NPTX2 are coupled to differential cognitive outcomes of aging, and that successful neurocognitive aging is associated with adaptive upregulation of NPTX2, not simply the persistence of youthful synaptic dynamics.",

      "title": "Non-linear relationships between the auditory mismatch responses and the level of inharmonicity of complex sounds",
      "content": "Predictive processing accounts of perception suggest that the brain is using an internal generative model to form predictions about the incoming stimuli. Precision weighting is an important facet of predictive processing theories and has been extensively studied with mismatch responses such as mismatch negativity (MMN). Harmonicity is a feature of sound that is important for auditory perception and previous research has shown that it modulates the brain mismatch responses. Since inharmonic sound spectra contain more information (have higher information entropy), inharmonicity has been suggested to be involved in precision weighting. In this study we explored this issue by parametrically modulating the level of inharmonicity applied to synthetic sounds and recording MMN and P3a responses from healthy volunteers. Our results show that a sigmoid function models the relationship between inharmonicity and MMN amplitude better than any linear or polynomial function. Furthermore, P3a amplitude has an inverted-U relationship with inharmonicity and peaks at inharmonicity levels just below the threshold for pitch discrimination. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that inharmonicity impairs F0 extraction above a certain threshold and does not serve as an index of precision in the auditory system.",

      "title": "A methodological framework for assessing neural control of shoulder muscles during multi-directional isometric tasks using high-density surface electromyography.",
      "content": "The complex movements of the shoulder rely on the coordinated activation of large muscles including the deltoid, pectoralis major, trapezius and latissimus dorsi. However, detailed knowledge of their neuromuscular control remains limited. This study aimed to develop a methodological framework to investigate the neural control of shoulder muscles by combining a 6-degree-of-freedom load cell attached to an industrial robotic arm with high-density surface electromyograms (HDsEMG). Six healthy participants performed isometric contractions (abduction, adduction, flexion and extension) at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction with the shoulder positioned at 30{degrees} and 65{degrees} of lateral abduction. HDsEMGs were recorded from the four muscles and analysed at both the global activation and motor unit levels. Global activation was quantified using root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude and topographic maps. Moreover, HDsEMGs were decomposed into individual motor unit spike trains and motor unit behaviour was characterized by mean discharge rate, coefficient of variation of inter-spike interval, and spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials (MUAPs). RMS maps revealed movement-specific activation within and between muscles, with the deltoid and trapezius active across all tasks, while the pectoralis and latissimus dorsi were predominantly activated during flexion and extension. Motor unit discharge rates also showed task-dependent recruitment. MUAP spatial distributions further showed distinct motor unit territories within arrays, suggesting region-specific recruitment strategies across movements. In conclusion, this framework demonstrates that individual motor unit activity can be reliably measured non-invasively in the main superficial shoulder muscles. The approach provides a methodological basis for incorporating neural control into biomechanical models of shoulder function.",

      "title": "Brain injury contributes to dopaminergic neurodegeneration, Lewy body pathology, and Parkinsonism preclinically with outcomes altered by T cell modulation",
      "content": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the risk of Parkinsons disease (PD) development later in life, but much remains unknown regarding the mechanisms driving this relationship. A single, mild brain injury triggers resident and peripheral neuroinflammatory pathways that are similarly activated in PD patients, which could possibly increase susceptibility to neurodegeneration. In this study, we used preclinical mouse models of mild TBI (mTBI) and PD to evaluate how injury-induced immune signaling may exacerbate PD-associated pathologies. Dopaminergic (DA) neurons showed upregulation of genes associated with neuroinflammation, adaptive immunity, and PD following mTBI. mTBI caused degeneration of DA neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and increased the spread of Lewy body (LB) pathology to other brain regions, such as the ipsilateral cortex, in a preclinical model of PD. Reducing adaptive immune infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) with a transgenic model lacking mature lymphocytes, or directly by in vivo depletion of T cells or B cells individually, improved neurodegenerative outcomes of DA neurons following brain injury. Our results indicate the possibility of a sustained, chronic peripheral immune cell infiltration which negatively affects both DA neurons and alpha synuclein (-syn) fibril propagation, providing insight on therapeutic windows to reduce DA neuron vulnerability.",

      "title": "The Effects of Mindfulness on Brain Network Dynamics Following an Acute Stressor in a Population of Moderate to Heavy Drinkers",
      "content": "Previous research has found that mindfulness-based techniques are beneficial for reducing stress in heavy drinking individuals. However, the underlying neurobiology of these stress-reducing effects are unclear. Moreover, much of the research examining neurobiological correlates of mindfulness have used static functional connectivity, suggesting brain activity goes unchanged for the entire length of an MRI scan. In the current study, we used a state-based dynamic functional connectivity model to examine brain states during either a 10-minute mindfulness session or resting control that followed an individually tailored stress imagery task. Using a Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM), six brain states and the associated dynamics of state traversal were estimated for the population. Participants that experienced the mindfulness session had more transitions and longer time spent in states in which the salience network was more active. Participants assigned to the control group had more transitions and increased time spent in states in which nodes of the default mode network were more active. Moreover, for control participants, increased occupancy time to SN-dominant states were associated with lower perceived stress. Using HSMM provided unique insight into network connectivity during mindful states; we believe it offers a novel approach to testing and optimizing the content of mindful-based therapies.",

      "title": "Conserved Aberrant Developmental Trajectories of Human and Mouse SBMA Motor Neurons",
      "content": "Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the androgen receptor gene (AR). Lower motor neuron loss is a key feature of the disease, yet it remains poorly understood why these cells are affected. The transcriptional mechanisms underlying SBMA pathogenesis and how these evolve across developmental and disease stages remains incompletely defined. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying motor neuron loss in SBMA, we first performed transcriptomic profiling of both induced pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons (iPSC-MNs) generated from SBMA patients and laser-captured micro dissected motor neurons (LCM-MNs) from symptomatic AR100 SBMA mice. We compared differential gene expression between the two models to identify shared transcriptional programs. To address the temporal progression of molecular changes we conducted profiling at key stages of motor neurogenesis in the developing iPSC-MNs and at pre-symptomatic and end- stage disease in AR100 SBMA mice to elucidate the emergence of the transcriptional phenotype and the trajectory of the gene expression changes. We found significant transcriptional convergence between these two species. Notably, shared dysregulation was observed in pathways related to the spliceosome, the cell cycle and mitochondrial function. These transcriptional alterations emerged early in motor neurogenesis suggesting a developmental component to SBMA. Further in AR100 LCM-MNs we also observed disruption of mitochondrial and DNA damage repair pathways from pre-symptomatic to end stage disease. This study identifies conserved pathogenic mechanisms across two SBMA model systems and provides crucial insights into the molecular basis and temporal dynamics of SBMA progression which may help identify potential therapeutic targets for SBMA.",

      "title": "The vermian-crest angle: a prediction model for foetal cystic posterior fossa anomalies",
      "content": "BackgroundAccurate categorisation of the upward rotation of the foetal cerebellar vermis continues to pose diagnostic challenges in prenatal medicine. Recently, a new parameter of the posterior fossa (PF), known as the vermian-crest angle (VCA), has been evaluated using three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) and prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate the performance of the VCA in categorizing PF anomalies using 3D-US and to determine its level of agreement with MRI.Study designWe conducted a cohort study involving confirmed cases of PF anomalies. We measured the VCA using 3D-US and compared our data with previously published reference values obtained through both 3D-US and MRI. For statistical analysis, we employed univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).ResultsWe identified 53 foetuses at a mean gestational age (GA) of 24.5 (SD 5.45) weeks with Blake\u2019s pouch cyst (BPC) (n =\u202f11), Dandy\u2013Walker malformation (DWM) (n =\u202f9), mega cisterna magna (MCM) (n =\u202f22), and vermian hypoplasia (VH) (n =\u202f11). Compared to published reference values, the VCA was significantly increased in DWMs (mean 130.6\u00b0, SD 16.75\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.01) and BPCs (mean 91.00\u00b0, SD 19.73\u00b0; p \u2264\u202f0.05). A VCA\u202f>\u202f80.1\u00b0 distinguished BPCs and DWMs from other PF anomalies, while a VCA\u202f>\u202f107\u00b0 differentiated BPCs from DWMs. When comparing subgroups with published MRI data, we found good agreement between 3D-US and MRI (ICC\u202f=\u202f0.71) (95% CI: 0.55\u20130.87).ConclusionThe VCA may be helpful in categorising PF anomalies using 3D-US, particularly BPC and DWM. The good agreement with MRI measurements reinforces the synergy of these tools in the diagnostic work-up.",

      "title": "Adrenergic signals influence proteomic responses in breast cancer cells",
      "content": "IntroductionBreast cancer remains a major health challenge due to its molecular heterogeneity and complex interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Adrenergic signaling, mediated by stress hormones such as noradrenaline, has emerged as a potential regulator of cancer progression, influencing cell proliferation, cell adhesion, migration, and invasion.MethodsThis study investigates the effects of adrenergic modulation on breast cancer spheroids from basal-like (MDA-MB-231, BT549) and luminal-like (T47D, MCF7) cell lines, using 3D culture systems as a more physiologically relevant model compared to traditional 2D monolayer cultures. The 3D spheroid model better recapitulates the structural complexity of tumors, providing insights into cell\u2013cell and cell-matrix interactions that influence signaling pathways and drug responses.ResultsNoradrenaline treatment significantly reduced spheroid size, invasion capacity, and the expression of EMT-related markers and integrins in MDA-MB-231 cells. These effects were partially reversed by propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Luminal-like spheroids, characterized by low ADRB2 abundance, displayed limited responsiveness to adrenergic modulation. Proteomic analysis revealed distinct subtype-specific responses, with basal-like spheroids showing pronounced alterations in pathways related to proliferation, cytoskeletal dynamics, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and metabolism, whereas luminal-like spheroids exhibited minimal changes.DiscussionOur findings reveal heterogeneity in adrenergic receptor signaling across basal-like and luminal-like breast cancer cell lines, and also within the basal-like subgroup. This diversity underscores the complexity of adrenergic signaling in breast cancer and highlights the advantages of 3D culture systems. These results provide valuable insights into the subtype-specific patterns of response to adrenergic signaling that contribute to tumor progression and may inform future studies including evaluation of therapeutic strategies.",

      "title": "An ICA-based artifact suppression method for online extraction of TMS-evoked potentials: toward closed-loop TMS-EEG applications beyond the motor cortex",
      "content": "Objective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with electroencephalography (EEG) has become a valuable tool in clinical and cognitive neuroscience. However, TMS-EEG signals often suffer from severe artifacts, particularly in lateral cortical regions where TMS-evoked muscle artifacts are pronounced, making real-time recovery of TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) challenging. We developed and validated a real-time, two-step independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact cleaning method for TMS-EEG signals, facilitating the rapid extraction of clean neural signals for closed-loop neurostimulation applications. Approach. Our method involves an offline ICA training phase, where ICA weights and artifact topographies are identified using pre-experimental trials, followed by an online phase in which the precomputed weight matrices are applied in real-time to incoming data. We conducted simulations on two pre-published TMS-EEG datasets (N = 28, ROIs = 6) to validate the method by identifying the minimum number of trials required to estimate ICA weights. We also assessed the reproducibility of TEPs and the stability of ICA components, taking classical offline TEPs as the relative ground truth. Main Results. ICA analysis suggests that it can be applied reliably within each region without significant loss of convergence and stability, provided careful consideration is given to the size and composition of the data used for ICA training. Simulation results indicated that while central regions could achieve reliable TEPs similar to ground truth with as few as 20\u201330 trials to train ICA in the pre-experimental phase, frontal and occipital regions required 50\u201360 trials to reach a comparable level of reliability. Later TEP peaks (>100 ms) in all regions achieved high reproducibility when at least 35 training trials were used, whereas earlier peaks (<80 ms) showed moderate reproducibility with the same number of trials. Significance. These findings establish the feasibility and proof-of-concept for real-time ICA-based artifact removal for closed-loop TMS-EEG applications. The method enables rapid extraction of clean neural signals, allowing adaptation of stimulation parameters in real time, thereby facilitating individualized neurostimulation paradigms.",

      "title": "Personalized beta band HD-tACS over the left SMA improves speech and limb movement by modulating prefrontal delta oscillations in neurotypical young adults",
      "content": "Objective. The supplementary motor area (SMA) demonstrates abnormal beta activity (13\u201330 Hz) during speech and limb movement tasks in neurological conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated promising improvement in motor and non-motor functions by entraining endogenous neural oscillations. We conducted an exploratory study on the modulatory effects of personalized beta high-definition (HD)-tACS over the left SMA on speech production and limb movement. Approach. In a repeated-measures experiment, twenty-two neurotypical young adults were recruited to participate in four stimulation conditions: sham, HD transcranial random noise stimulation (HD-tRNS), and HD-tACS tuned to each individual\u2019s frequency of maximal SMA beta activity (identified using source-localized EEG) during speech (tuned-to-speech, TtS) and limb movement (tuned-to-limb, TtL). All participants completed a 25 min sham/active stimulation over the left SMA, followed by an interleaved speech production and limb movement task. Main results. Behavioral results showed that active stimulation resulted in more pronounced improvements in reaction times compared to the sham condition, regardless of the active stimulation type. The neural correlates of this aftereffect were indicated by a prominent modulation in delta power in prefrontal and frontocentral electrodes during speech and limb movement tasks following personalized beta TtS and TtL HD-tACS, relative to sham and tRNS. Significance. Personalized beta HD-tACS modulated delta oscillations, rather than beta rhythms, in a task-specific manner, highlighting the brain\u2019s adaptive response. These findings have implications for neurological conditions such as PD, which are characterized by deficits in speech production and limb motor coordination.",
