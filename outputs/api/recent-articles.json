      "title": "Behavioral orienting but not novelty activates dopamine neurons",
      "content": "Novel stimuli have a profound impact on brain function and behavior. They evoke attention, arousal and sensory exploration and induce synaptic plasticity in brain regions related to learning and memory. Many of these effects have been attributed to novelty-evoked activation of the dopaminergic midbrain and dopamine (DA) release in major projection targets in the striatum. However, it remains controversial if individual DA neurons respond to novel stimuli. To address this question, we recorded and manipulated DA neurons in mice exposed to novel and familiar odors while monitoring orienting behaviors including exploratory sniffing, facial movements, and pupil dilation. We found that DA neurons were activated by orienting behaviors, rather than by novelty itself. Moreover, their activity was causally involved in generating the orienting responses. Finally, we identified a major input region to the dopaminergic midbrain which couples orienting to DA firing. Activity in the mediodorsal pons (mdPons) correlated tightly with sniffing and facial movements. Consequently, optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic mdPons neurons induced both orienting and DA firing. Our findings suggest that DA neurons do not respond to novelty per se but are activated through descending glutamatergic projections from the mdPons. This mechanism links salient sensory events to DA release, providing a basis for novelty-evoked exploration and plasticity.",

      "title": "White-Matter BOLD Mediates Time-Varying Cortico-Cortical Functional Connectivity",
      "content": "Functional connectivity (FC) measurements in the brain using BOLD fMRI have largely focused on correlations between gray-matter (GM) BOLD signals, ignoring the possible relevance of white-matter (WM) in delineating neural networks. We first employed a tract-informed mediation framework to test whether WM pathways contribute indirect, bundle-specific effects to cortico-cortical coupling. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we quantified pathway-level mediation effects across GM-WM-GM units and found that WM BOLD signals significantly mediated GM-GM associations, with clear tract-dependent heterogeneity. Building upon this, we examined how dynamic features of WM BOLD signals relate to time-varying intra-cortical FC. We found that temporal variability of WM signals, rather than their mean amplitudes, more closely tracked fluctuations in GM-GM dynamic connectivity, with correlations reaching approximately 0.4 across specific tracts. Together, these results indicate that WM BOLD signals are related to how cortical regions interact, underscoring their integral role in large-scale brain network organization.",

      "title": "Master clock-thalamic-prefrontal circuit controls circadian social priority",
      "content": "Social behaviors arise from complex brain operations that adapt to intricate targets and varying states. Achieving a singular social goal requires an extensive social brain network, of which computation is malleable and subject to modulation by diverse internal factors. However, how the brain leverages its internal state to navigate competing social goals is elusive. Here we show that the priority between competing instincts-social novelty versus sexual preference-exhibits a distinct circadian pattern. This is controlled by a two-component circuit linking the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key brain region in the social brain network. Specifically, SCNVIP neurons project to Vipr2-expressing neurons within the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE), which in turn projects to the mPFC to mediate this behavior. The function of Vipr2 in the RE is critical for shaping the circadian pattern of both appetitive and consummatory social behaviors. This allows higher social functions to be engaged in a timely manner, appropriately aligning prioritized social behaviors with the body's clock-regulated reproductive system. Overall, this SCN-RE-mPFC circuit provides a neural principle through which the master clock coordinates the prefrontal cortex to resolve a conflict of motivated behaviors by referencing an internal state.",

      "title": "Modeling the Action-Perception Loop and its role in Phantom Limb Pain using Active Inference",
      "content": "Phantom limb pain is among the most prevalent and distressing consequences of limb amputation. Theories regarding its underlying mechanisms remain disputed, contributing to challenges in effectively treating the pain. In recent years, mathematical models grounded in the Bayesian inference framework have been used to describe various aspects of pain perception. However, pain is not only passively inferred but actively shaped through interactions with the environment--a dimension that classical Bayesian approaches typically do not capture. Because amputation disrupts both sensory input related to the limb and the ability to perform actions, a model incorporating both sensory and active components of pain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain. To this end, we developed a model within the active inference framework, which extends Bayesian inference to include action selection. The model provides a conceptual account of how loss of limb control, ambiguity in sensory input pertaining to limb position, residual noxious input, and preamputation pain may contribute to the emergence and persistence of phantom limb pain. Furthermore, it offers insight into the possible mechanisms underlying common interventions and may help account for their variable efficacy across individuals.",

      "content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are major neurodegenerative disorders with characteristic EEG alterations. While most prior studies have focused on eyes-closed (EC) EEG, where stable alpha rhythms support relatively high classification performance, eyes-open (EO) EEG has proven particularly challenging for AD, as low-frequency instability obscures the typical spectral alterations. In contrast, FTD often remains more discriminable under EO conditions, reflecting distinct neurophysiological dynamics between the two disorders. To address this challenge, we propose a CNN-based framework that applies Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to segment EO EEG into shorter temporal windows and employs a 3D CNN to capture spatio-temporal-spectral representations. This approach outperformed not only the conventional short-epoch spectral ML pipeline but also the same CNN architecture trained on FFT-based features, with particularly pronounced improvements observed in AD classification. Excluding delta yielded small gains in AD-involving contrasts, whereas FTD/CN was unchanged or slightly better with delta retained\u2014suggesting delta is more perturbative in AD under EO conditions.",

      "content": "Epilepsy is the 4th most prevalent neurological condition with 50 million cases worldwide. Patients with epilepsy bare a disproportionate burden of cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders which remain poorly understood and go underdressed by current anti-epileptic treatments. Furthermore, pre-clinical work on behavioral comorbidities can be hampered by current testing frameworks which rely on well-defined, discreet tests with limited repeatability. Recent work has demonstrated a role for machine learning modalities such as Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) in assessing behavioral differences between naive and epileptic. In this study we combined MoSeq with a novel analysis pipeline to uncover repetitive behaviors in chronically epileptic mice. These repetitive behaviors emerge alongside epilepsy specific racing behaviors which persist in epileptic mice as disease progresses. Finally, we show that epileptic mice have more fragile and dispersed behavioral networks. Together, these results lay a groundwork for extracting clinically relevant phenotypes from MoSeq data throughout disease progression.",

      "title": "Social isolation upregulates takeout expression in female Drosophila melanogaster to promote sucrose feeding",
      "content": "Drosophila melanogaster provides a model system to examine how environmental stress interacts with sex to induce changes in brain function and behavior. Previous research suggests that social isolation induces changes in gene expression that encode a starvation-like brain state and reduce sleep. However, the extent to which social isolation alters behaviors via sex-specific brain changes is unclear. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to explore sex differences in chronic social isolation-induced behavioral and transcriptomic changes. We focused on takeout (to), a gene encoding a putative juvenile hormone-binding protein, as a target that is upregulated solely in females following social isolation. Male and female adult flies were exposed to chronic social isolation, and multiple behavioral sex differences were identified through tests of activity, motivation, aggression, and sugar consumption. RNA-seq analysis also identified several candidate genes that were associated with sex differences in isolation-induced behavioral changes. Our findings suggest that social isolation is sufficiently stressful to reveal latent sex differences in behavior, despite having no impact on survival. To expression and sucrose consumption were upregulated exclusively in females following social isolation. Following to knockdown in to-expressing cells, sucrose consumption decreased in socially isolated females but increased in males. However, to knock down, to overexpression, and transformer knock down in neurons did not change sucrose-feeding behavior between control and isolated females. Overall, our results suggest that manipulating to expression influences sucrose-feeding in opposite directions between females and males following social isolation, and that isolation-induced to overexpression in non-neuronal cells in the brain or head may play a role in communicating information about females nutritional status to the brain. Additional roles for to in stress-related behaviors and behavioral sex differences should be explored, as well as whether to participates in signaling pathways that may be functionally conserved in human disorders.",

      "title": "Acute in vivo proximity labeling for membrane targeted proteomics in neuronal circuits",
      "content": "A major goal within molecular systems neuroscience is to bridge the study of neuronal circuit function with changes in protein expression and localization in awake behaving animals. However, there are limited tools for capturing changes in subcellularly-defined proteomes within neuronal circuits during activity-gated timescales in vivo. Here, we engineered targeted versions of the proximity labeling enzyme TurboID, to tag proteins at the neuronal membrane during a user-delivered biotin injection. We optimized a labeling strategy that enables a one-to-two-hour labeling window and tagged proteins in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) cell bodies and corresponding axons in two downstream projections. We performed proteomics to identify proteins enriched in the distinct mPFC axonal projections, and discovered proteins enriched following an acute cocaine injection in mPFC cell bodies. These advancements enable the detection of proteins at the subcellular level within short labeling windows, allowing identification of stimulus-specific proteomes in behaving mice.",

      "title": "Shaft versus spine localization affects the structural plasticity of glutamatergic synapses",
      "content": "In the early stages of development, most excitatory synapses are formed directly on dendritic shafts. As neurons mature, these sites gradually shift from the shaft to dendritic spines. In fully developed excitatory neurons, the majority of glutamatergic postsynaptic sites containing the postsynaptic density (PSD) molecules reside on dendritic spines. However, some glutamatergic synapses remain as shaft synapses, yet their characteristics have remained unexplored. Here, we show that the molecular composition of the shaft PSDs closely resembles that of spine PSDs. Key components such as AMPARs, NMDARs, CaV1.2 channels, and F-actin interacting proteins, SynGAP, as well as cortactin, are present in comparable amounts in both synapse types. The major distinction between shaft and spine PSDs lies in the lower abundance of the scaffold proteins Shanks and Homer in shaft PSDs. Shaft synapses are not merely passive structures but actively participate in synaptic transmission. Their structure and function are modulated by changes in neuronal activity. Long-term live imaging combined with a cLTP protocol revealed that shaft PSDs were potentiated but rarely underwent a transition to spine synapses. In contrast, during LTD, shaft PSDs were eliminated more frequently than their spine counterparts. Together, these findings highlight excitatory shaft synapses as a distinct, and notably less stable, synapse type.",

      "title": "NKCC1 as a signaling hub regulating KCC2 stability, chloride homeostasis, and seizure susceptibility",
      "content": "Chloride homeostasis relies on the dynamic balance between the neuronal co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2. We reveal an unexpected mechanism by which NKCC1 governs KCC2 membrane stability. NKCC1 clusters recruits SPAK and PP1 to dynamically trap KCC2, compensating for its lack of a direct SPAK-binding site. Single-particle tracking shows that these NKCC1-rich assemblies operate as signaling hubs, enabling either SPAK-driven KCC2 phosphorylation and its membrane destabilization or PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of SPAK and KCC2 membrane stabilization. Peptides that activate SPAK by engaging NKCC1 PP1-binding motif lower KCC2 surface levels and reduce chloride extrusion, whereas a SPAK-inhibiting peptide prevents SPAK recruitment to NKCC1, stabilizes KCC2 in membrane clusters, and enhances chloride extrusion. An optimized peptide analog preserves KCC2 clustering under hyperexcitable conditions, reduces seizure frequency and severity in PTZ-induced epilepsy, and suppresses ictal activity in human epileptic tissue. These findings identify NKCC1-KCC2 coupling as a central regulatory axis for inhibitory signaling, and position our peptides as promising therapeutic candidates to restore chloride homeostasis in epilepsy and other disorders marked by impaired KCC2 membrane stability.",

      "title": "Selective Inactivation of Astrocytic Monoacylglycerol Lipase for Alzheimer Disease Therapy",
      "content": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, yet effective therapies remain lacking. Here, we identify monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the principal enzyme that degrades the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the brain, specifically in astrocytes as a promising therapeutic target for AD. APP transgenic (TG) mice with astrocyte-specific MAGL deletion (T-aKO), but not neuron-specific deletion (TG-nKO), exhibit markedly reduced A{beta} pathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, along with preserved synaptic structure and function and improved cognition. These benefits are recapitulated in TG mice by AAV-mediated silencing of astrocytic MAGL, whereas MAGL overexpression accelerates neuropathology and exacerbates synaptic and cognitive deficits. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that dysregulated synapse-, inflammation-, and AD-related gene expression profiles are reversed in TG-aKO mice. MAGL expression is elevated in astrocytes from both AD patients and TG mice. Remarkably, a single intracerebroventricular injection of AAV-MAGL-shRNA administered at either presymptomatic or postsymptomatic stages prevents or reverses neuropathology and synaptic and cognitive impairments in TG mice, providing preclinical evidence that astrocytic MAGL silencing represents an effective therapeutic strategy for AD.",
