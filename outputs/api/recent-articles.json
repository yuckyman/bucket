      "title": "Adaptation of Perceived Animacy from Biological Motion: Evidence for a \"Life Motion Detector\"",
      "content": "Humans can readily perceive animacy from biological motion (BM) - the distinctive movement patterns of living entities. However, how the human brain extracts animacy information from BM remains largely unclear. The current study investigated this issue using visual adaptation, a non-invasive tool for revealing neural mechanisms underlying the selective processing of specific properties. Results showed that prolonged exposure to intact human walkers, compared to non-BM adaptors, biased the perception of subsequent walking stimuli towards less animate. This adaptation aftereffect persisted following adaptation to local foot motions carrying diagnostic kinematic cues, but was absent after exposure to static body forms, indicating the involvement of neuronal populations encoding animacy from BM based on motion signals. Moreover, adapting to pigeon movements also biased animacy perception for human motions, revealing a shared mechanism for encoding animacy from cross-species BM signals. These results support the existence of an inherent \"life detection\" system in the human brain, attuned to local foot motions and kinematic features prevalent in vertebrate movements, which may lay a foundation for perceiving life from motion across terrestrial species.",

      "title": "Modeling neurodegenerative diseases in Drosophila is conditioned by stress resistance and gut microbiome composition of the reference line",
      "content": "Drosophila is widely used to study the pathological mechanisms of human diseases in vivo, including metabolic and neurological disorders. In these models, disease-induced alterations in locomotion and stress resistance are generally monitored in comparison to healthy control flies, such the white-eyed strain w1118, used as a reference for normal physiology and behavior. Here we compared two independent w1118 lines and found that they differed strikingly in their susceptibility to oxidative stress and nutrient starvation, and less markedly in their locomotor performance. Interestingly, modulating the gut microbiome by rearing these flies under axenic conditions increased oxidative stress resistance of the more susceptible, but not the more resistant line, while it had no effect on starvation resistance for both lines. We also found that the stress-sensitive line had higher levels of Clostridiales bacteria and of the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia in the gut microbiota, as well as lower expression levels of immune effectors (antimicrobial peptides and lysozymes) in the head and gut. Both lines nevertheless showed similar susceptibility to pathogenic bacterial infections. In a transgenic Parkinson's disease model, the stress-resistant background strongly attenuated the progressive locomotor defects induced by pan-neuronal expression of human mutant -synuclein, but intriguingly not when -synuclein expression was restricted to a subset of brain dopaminergic neurons in the protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) cluster. These results suggest that taking into account unapparent features of the reference lines could improve the reproducibility and consistency of neurodegenerative disease models in Drosophila.",

      "title": "An Innate Immune Receptor Toll-1 converts chronic light stress into glial phagocytosis",
      "content": "Chronic stress can cause progressive neuronal degeneration, yet the molecular mechanisms linking stress sensing to neuroimmune responses remain elusive. In this study, a Drosophila model of chronic light-induced stress, we show that photoreceptor neurons accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exhibit Toll-1 activation, in association with Spz ligands and receptor endocytosis. Toll-1 activation in neurons promotes axonal degeneration by inducing expression of the glial phagocytic receptor Draper (Drpr), leading to the engulfment of stressed axons. Genetic interaction analyses indicate that Toll-1 functions upstream of Drpr in a stress-responsive signaling cascade. Importantly, blocking either Toll-1 or Drpr attenuates axon loss under light stress, highlighting their essential roles. Our findings reveal a neuron-glia communication axis in which neuronal innate immune signaling instructs glial phagocytosis, converting sustained environmental stress into structural degeneration. This study provides a mechanistic framework for sterile neurodegeneration and offers insights into how immune receptors regulate nervous system integrity under non-infectious conditions.",

      "title": "Stuttering: the nature of the speech disruptions\u2014a multimodal study of articulation and phonation",
      "content": "Stuttering is a disorder characterized by transient disruptions in speech motor production. This article is focused on the characteristics of stuttering and the immediate vocal tract mechanisms resulting in stuttered speech disruptions. A range of observations from an initial series of studies on the motor characteristics of stuttering events in adults is presented, combined with a narrative review of published data regarding objective and subjective aspects of instances of stuttering. The aims of the empirical studies were to develop methods for data collection and analysis, as well as collecting and analyzing initial data. The analysis was exploratory and qualitative, focusing on physiological data from individual stuttering events in order to understand their underlying dynamics and mechanisms. As a frame of reference, the motor characteristics and subjective experiences of stuttering were compared with the characteristics of known movement disorders, such as dystonia, motor blocks (e.g., freezing of gait), and tremor. The results show that stuttering events can include both negative and positive motor signs. It is proposed that stuttered disruptions can arise both as a result of insufficient muscular activation and as a result of interfering dysfunctional muscular activity. It is further suggested that the characteristics of stuttering to a very high degree correspond to motor block symptoms, indicating a transient inability to execute the next motor program in the speech sequence. Elements of dystonia may account for some symptoms. Volitional attempts to break fixed postures may increase the muscular tension and result in tremor, similar to dystonic tremor. The severity of the tremor is strongly correlated with the severity of physical concomitants. Tremor may be silent, as well as resulting in rapid audible repetitions if the vocal tract is opened and closed at the tremor frequency. Silent periods in stuttering can result from total closure of the airway at the level of the larynx, the tongue, or the lips. However, silent periods can also result from excessive opening of the vocal folds, leading to silent airflow and an inability to phonate. It is proposed that the motor blocks stem from transient decoupling between cortical and basal ganglia networks.",

      "content": "ObjectiveNon-invasive Brain\u2013Computer Interfaces provide accurate classification of hand movement lateralization. However, distinguishing activation patterns of individual fingers within the same hand remains challenging due to their overlapping representations in the motor cortex. Here, we validated a compact convolutional neural network for fast and reliable decoding of finger movements from non-invasive magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings.ApproachWe recorded healthy participants in MEG performing a serial reaction time task (SRTT), with buttons pressed by left and right index and middle fingers. We devised classifiers to identify left vs. right hand movements and among four finger movements using a recently proposed decoding approach, Linear Finite Impulse Response Convolutional Neural Network (LF-CNN). We also compared LF-CNN to existing deep learning architectures such as EEGNet, FBCSP-ShallowNet, and VGG19.ResultsSequence learning was reflected by a decrease in reaction times during SRTT performance. Movement laterality was decoded with an accuracy superior to 95% by all approaches, while for individual finger movement, decoding was in the 80\u201385% range. LF-CNN stood out for (1) its low computational time and (2) its interpretability in both spatial and spectral domains, allowing to examine neurophysiological patterns reflecting task-related motor cortex activity.SignificanceWe demonstrated the feasibility of finger movement decoding with a tailored Convolutional Neural Network. The performance of our approach was comparable to complex deep learning architectures, while providing faster and interpretable outcome. This algorithmic strategy holds high potential for the investigation of the mechanisms underlying non-invasive neurophysiological recordings in cognitive neuroscience.",

      "content": "IntroductionNon-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, particularly repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), have shown potential in stroke rehabilitation. However, systematic reviews often reach conflicting conclusions, highlighting the need for an umbrella review.ObjectiveTo synthesize, based on the principal domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework, the best available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of NIBS for improving motor impairment and disability after stroke.MethodsWe conducted an umbrella review (PROSPERO: CRD42021239577) that included meta-analyses of controlled trials investigating NIBS effects in stroke survivors, retrieved from PubMed/MEDLINE from February 2020 to July 2025. Methodological quality was appraised using AMSTAR-2 and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes were mapped to ICF body structure/function and activity domains.ResultsFifty-six studies were included (2\u201348 primary trials each; 54\u20131,654 participants per meta-analysis). All included studies evaluated only rTMS and tDCS; no meta-analyses of other NIBS modalities met inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was high or moderate in 85.7% of the meta-analyses. Certainty of evidence was low or very low for 14/50 studies; only one rTMS review provided moderate-certainty evidence for activities of daily living. rTMS showed improvement in activities of daily living (ADL; SMD = \u22120.82, 95% CI \u22121.05 to \u22120.59), upper-limb motor impairment (SMD = \u22120.32, 95% CI \u22120.55 to \u22120.09) and variable effects on mobility from small (SMD = \u22120.35, 95% CI \u22120.45 to \u22120.24) to large (SMD = \u22120.97, 95% CI \u22121.28 to \u22120.66). tDCS was supported by very-low-certainty evidence: small effects were found for motor impairment (SMD = \u22120.22, 95 % CI \u22120.32 to \u22120.12) and upper-limb activity (SMD = \u22120.31, 95% CI \u22120.55 to \u22120.01), while a much smaller subset of trials suggested a large effect (SMD = \u22121.54, 95% CI \u22122.78 to \u22120.29). Effects on ADL and mobility with tDCS were inconsistent and generally non-significant.ConclusionrTMS was more frequently associated with moderate to large effect sizes for body structure/function outcomes, particularly general neurological function. In contrast, tDCS demonstrated small effects on motor recovery, though evidence certainty was very low due to heterogeneity, imprecision, and protocol variability. Within the activity domain, NIBS showed modest effects, with rTMS showing more consistent benefits for ADL. tDCS effects were generally limited and supported by low to very low certainty of evidence.Systematic review registrationhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42021239577.",

      "title": "Computational analysis of optogenetic inhibition of CA1 neurons using a data-efficient and interpretable potassium and chloride conducting opsin model",
      "content": "Objective. Optogenetic inhibition of excitatory neuronal populations has emerged as a potential strategy for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. However, achieving effective seizure suppression in animal models using optogenetic techniques has proven challenging. This difficulty can be attributed to a suboptimal stimulation method that involves numerous complex variables. This study aims to examine how various stimulation parameters and opsin characteristics influence the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition protocols. Additionally, a new opsin model is introduced that permits easy implementation of the experimentally derived parameters describing the opsin\u2019s opening and closing dynamics. Approach. The mathematical description of a chloride and potassium conducting opsin was combined with a conductance-based model of a pyramidal CA1 neuron. Simulations with varying parameters were conducted to explore the effects of the stimulation paradigm and the neuronal environment on inhibition. A simplified, adaptable opsin model was used to test the robustness of these results and explore the impact of variations in opsin characteristics. Main results. Stronger inhibition was achieved with higher illumination intensities, pulse repetition frequencies, and duty cycles. Potassium conducting opsins were found to be more stable than chloride conducting ones. These findings were independent of the opsin\u2019s parameters. Additionally, changes in the opsin\u2019s dynamics had negligible impact when the opening and closing time constants were varied by factors between 0.5 and 2. Significance. This study provides key insights into the stimulation and physiological parameters that affect optogenetic inhibition. The findings highlight the importance of choosing the right stimulation protocol and opsin for optimizing optogenetic strategies. The newly developed opsin model also offers a new, valuable tool that will facilitate future research into the development of an improved optogenetic modulation protocol for seizure suppression.",

      "title": "Towards a closed loop retinal prosthesis: measuring electrically evoked retinal responses using large electrodes",
      "content": "Objective. Sensory prostheses use arrays of electrodes to stimulate neural tissue and restore a sense of vision or hearing. At perceptible levels of stimulation, the current from each electrode spreads and causes overlapping regions of neural activation. This lack of specificity results in perceptual deficits. Methods to overcome this reduced specificity, such as a closed loop stimulation approach require measurement of the neural response to stimulation. This investigation tests the possibility of using the large stimulating electrodes such as those required by some subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal implants to measure the neural response to stimulation, an approach similar to Evoked Compound Action Potentials measurements used in cochlear implants. Approach. Ex vivo tissue samples from Long Evans rats with healthy retinas and Royal College of Surgeon rats with retinal degeneration were used to investigate both stimulating and recording from electrodes of the same array. A hexagonal array was used with 20 platinum electrodes with 500 \u03bcm diameter and 700 \u03bcm pitch. Post-stimulus voltage decay was reduced with appropriate tuning of a triphasic stimulation pulse and in post-analysis with a high-pass filter. A method using alternating polarities of biphasic pulses was also trialed. A cocktail of synaptic and ion channel blockers was used to block all neural response including action potentials and thus confirm the biological origin of the signal. Main Results. It was found that a neural signal was observable on electrode that were sufficiently distant from the stimulating electrodes. The signal appeared to be due to direct activation of ganglion cells or possibly mediated via inner retinal neurons. Significance. This result confirms that recording usable neural signals from large electrodes is possible, which is an essential step in implementing a closed loop stimulation strategy for a subretinal or suprachoroidal retinal prosthesis.",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation-induced local evoked potentials outperform spectral features in spatial and clinical STN mapping",
      "content": "Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an established therapy for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Yet, optimizing lead placement and stimulation programming remains challenging. Current techniques rely on imaging and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MER), while programming relies on trial-and-error clinical testing, which can be time-consuming. DBS-induced local evoked potentials (DLEP), also known as evoked resonant neural activity, have emerged as a potential alternative electrophysiological marker for mapping. However, direct comparisons with traditional spectral features, such as beta-band, high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), and aperiodic component are lacking. Approach. We evaluated DLEP across 39 STN DBS leads in 31 subjects with PD undergoing DBS surgery, using both a single-pulse and high-frequency (HF) burst stimulation paradigms. We developed a novel artifact-removal method to enable monopolar DLEP recovery, including estimating the DLEP amplitudes at stimulated contacts, further enhancing spatial sampling of DLEP. We evaluated spectral features and DLEP in respect to imaging-based and MER-based localization, and its predictive power for post-operative programming. Main results. DLEP showed great spatial consistency, maximizing within STN with 100% accuracy for single-pulse and 84.62% for burst stimulation, surpassing spectral measures including beta (89.74%) and HFO (82.05%). DLEP better correlated with clinical outcomes (single-pulses \u03c1 = \u22120.33, HF bursts \u03c1 = \u22120.26), than spectral measures (beta \u03c1 = \u22120.25, HFO \u03c1 = 0.05). Furthermore, single-pulses at low-frequencies are sufficient for DLEP-based mapping. Significance. We show how DLEP provide higher STN-spatial specificity and correlation with postoperative programming compared to spectral features. To support clinical translation of DLEP, we developed two methods aimed to recover artifact-free DLEP and estimating DLEP amplitudes at stimulating contacts. DLEP appear distinct from beta and HFO activity, yet strongly tied to aperiodic spectral components, suggesting that DLEP amplitude reflects underlying STN excitability. This study highlights that DLEP are a robust and clinically valuable marker for DBS targeting and programming.",

      "content": "Objective. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a promising brain imaging tool due to its cost-effectiveness and balance between spatial and temporal resolution. However, its reliance on the 10-20 EEG coordinate system for probe placement introduces potential inaccuracies in cortical localization. Despite concerns regarding its spatial precision, the integration of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with fNIRS for validating signal localization has not been systematically explored. This study aimed to demonstrate the interindividual variability in hand motor representations and how it influences the precision of fNIRS recordings during motor tasks. Approach. Neuronavigated TMS was employed on 18 neurotypical adults to map the motor representations of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and fourth dorsal interosseous (4DI) muscles. Center-of-gravity (CoG) coordinates from TMS-evoked motor maps were compared with fNIRS channel locations, including the theoretical hand channel defined by the 10-20 EEG system. FNIRS signals were recorded during a hand-grasp motor task, and the subject-specific hand channel was determined by identifying the fNIRS channel closest to the individual\u2019s TMS CoG. Main Results. TMS motor mapping revealed substantial interindividual variability, with 56% of participants demonstrating deviations from the theoretical fNIRS hand channel. TMS motor maps showed that the FDI and 4DI representations were closely positioned, with the 4DI representation slightly anterior to the FDI (p = 0.022). Analysis of fNIRS signals indicated that subject-specific hand channels exhibited significantly higher hemodynamic response amplitudes compared to the theoretical hand channel (p = 0.0004), suggesting enhanced signal sensitivity when using individualized cortical mapping. Additionally, fNIRS signal variance was significantly higher in the theoretical channel, indicating greater signal variability and lower signal robustness. Significance. These findings highlight the limitations of rigidly applying the 10-20 EEG system for spatial localization in fNIRS-based motor studies and show the benefits of integrating TMS-derived cortical mapping for improved signal accuracy and robustness.",

      "title": "Towards stimulation-free automatic electrocorticographic speech mapping in neurosurgery patients",
      "content": "Objective. The precise mapping of speech-related functions is crucial for successful neurosurgical interventions in epilepsy and brain tumor cases. Traditional methods like electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) are effective but carry a significant risk of inducing seizures. Methods. To address this, we have prepared a comprehensive ESM\u2009+\u2009electrocorticographic mapping (ECM) dataset from 14 patients with chronically implanted stereo-EEG electrodes. Then we explored several compact machine learning (ML) approaches to convert the ECM signals to the ground truth derived from the risky ESM procedure. Both procedures involved the standard picture naming task. As features, we used gamma-band power within successive temporal windows in the data averaged with respect to picture and voice onsets. We focused on a range of classifiers, including XGBoost, linear support vector classification (SVC), regularized logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, multi-Layer perceptron, AdaBoost and Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers and equipped them with confidence interval estimates, crucial in a real-life application. We validated the ML approaches using a leave-one-patient-out procedure and computed ROC and Precision\u2013Recall curves for various feature combinations. Results. For linear SVC we achieved ROC-AUC and PR-AUC scores of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, which effectively distinguishes speech-related from non-related iEEG channels. We have also observed that the use of information on the voice onset moment notably improved the classification accuracy. Significance. We have for the first time rigorously compared the ECM and ESM results and mimicked a real-life use of the ECM technology. We have also provided public access to the comprehensive ECM+ESM dataset to pave the road towards safer and more reliable eloquent cortex mapping procedures.",

      "title": "Instantaneous recognition method for lower limb continuous motion based on onset-window surface electromyography data",
      "content": "Objective. Human\u2013robot collaboration in lower-limb rehabilitation devices imposes stringent requirements on both the recognition accuracy of motion intention and real-time responsiveness. The precise recognition of lower limb motion based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has always been a primary focus of study. However, achieving low-delay recognition in lower limb continuous motion while maintaining accuracy remains a challenge, which is key to unlocking the full potential for the effective deployment and widespread application of robots. Approach. An innovative recognition method in lower limb continuous motion was presented in this paper, which investigated the instantaneous recognition network (IRN) and continuous recognition (CR) model. Main results. The comparative analysis revealed that by utilizing an optimal length of 210 for the onset-window sEMG data, the proposed IRN could substantially reduce the time delay from 300 ms/350 ms to 60 ms at the methodological level. The implementation of the class-balanced method enhanced motion recognition accuracy by an additional 4.83% within the onset window. The CR model was validated across seven scenarios, comprehensively covering all potential situations in daily continuous movements, and achieved an average accuracy of 96.31%. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of the proposed instantaneous recognition method to enhance performance in lower limb continuous motion, providing an innovative approach for research on human\u2013robot synchronization.",

      "title": "Extracting robust single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials for non-invasive brain computer interfaces",
      "content": "Objective. Reliable extraction of single-trial somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is essential for developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications to support rehabilitation after brain injury. For real-time feedback, these responses must be extracted prospectively on every trial, with minimal post-processing and artifact correction. However, noninvasive SEPs elicited by electrical stimulation at recommended parameter settings (0.1\u20130.2 msec pulse width, stimulation at or below motor threshold, 2\u20135 Hz frequency) are typically small and variable, often requiring averaging across multiple trials or extensive processing. Here, we describe and evaluate ways to optimize the stimulation setup to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of noninvasive single-trial SEPs, enabling more reliable extraction. Approach. SEPs were recorded with scalp electroencephalography in tibial nerve stimulation in thirteen healthy people, and two people with CNS injuries. Three stimulation frequencies (lower than recommended: 0.2 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz) with a pulse width longer than recommended (1 msec), at a stimulation intensity based on H-reflex and M-wave at Soleus muscle were evaluated. Detectability of single-trial SEPs relative to background noise was tested offline and in a pseudo-online analysis, followed by a real-time demonstration. Mainresults. SEP N70 was observed predominantly at the central scalp regions. Online decoding performance was significantly higher with Laplacian filter. Generalization performance showed an expected degradation, at all frequencies, with an average decrease of 5.9% (multivariate) and 6.5% (univariate), with an AUC score ranging from 0.78\u20130.90. The difference across stimulation frequencies was not significant. In individuals with injuries, AUC of 0.86 (incomplete spinal cord injury) and 0.81 (stroke) was feasible. Real-time demonstration showed SEP detection with AUC of 0.89. Significance. This study describes and evaluates a system for extracting single-trial SEPs in real-time, suitable for a BCI-based operant conditioning. It enhances SNR of individual SEPs by alternate electrical stimulation parameters, dry headset, and optimized signal processing.",

      "title": "Unveiling functional heterogeneity in anatomical functional areas: a framework for fine-grained functional connectivity analysis of wide-field calcium imaging data",
      "content": "Objective. Conventional functional connectivity (FC) analysis of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) data relies on the assumption of homogeneity within predefined anatomical functional areas (FAs), where the signal averaged within each FA serves as the foundation for inter-FA connectivity modeling. However, accumulating evidence suggested significant intra-FA functional heterogeneity with functionally distinct subregions. This study aims to systematically examine the existence of the heterogeneity and the consequences of violating the homogeneity assumption on the FC analysis. Approach. We propose a three-step approach: (1) The spatiotemporal clustering of pixels with similar activity dynamics into functional parcels (FPs). (2) Classifying FPs according to their cortex-wide connectivity profiles into four categories: cross-hemispheric (CH), unihemispheric (UH), cross-modal (CM) and unimodal (UM). (3) Gauging the consequences and utility of above analysis. Main results. Analysis of adult mice WFCI data (n = 6) shows that pixels can be reliably clustered into FPs, and that FPs fall into different categories and form distinct subregions, unveiling the functional heterogeneity within each FA. Crucially, fine-grained FC analysis for different categories of subregions uncovered significant differences compared to the results from the conventional method. Application of the analysis to longitudinal WFCI data on mouse brain development (n = 17) demonstrates increases in CM and CH subregions and decreases in UM and UH subregions over time, in line with expectations based on prior research into neurodevelopment and network reorganization. Significance. The present study develops a fine-grained FC analysis framework, leveraging the high spatiotemporal resolution of WFCI to more precisely characterize large-scale cortical network dynamics. The observed differences between FCs derived using the proposed framework and those from conventional methods highlight the need for caution regarding the functional homogeneity assumption in conventional FC analysis. Furthermore, the developmental regularities revealed in longitudinal mouse brain data demonstrate the utility of fine-grained FC analysis.",

      "content": "Objectives. Reconstruction of visual perception from brain signals has emerged as a promising research topic. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a kind of high-quality intracranial signal with good spatiotemporal resolution that offers some new opportunities. However, according to our knowledge, there are no studies to reconstruct the perceived images from human ECoG signals at present. Approach. We have conducted the pioneering work and developed a novel pipeline that integrates Talairach coordinate alignment masked autoencoders (TA-MAE) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our approach exploits the spatiotemporal dynamics of human ECoG signals, enabling the restoration of details in high-resolution. Main results. Experiments show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of appearance, structure, signal-noise ratio, and semantic consistency. Additionally, our study indicated that unsupervised learning-based signal reconstruction outperforms manually annotated label-guided feature recognition in capturing the low-dimensional representation of brain signals, potentially facilitating the exploration of vision\u2019s intrinsic mechanisms. Significance. These results highlight the advantages of unsupervised decoding and provide a generalizable framework for human ECoG-based visual reconstruction.",
