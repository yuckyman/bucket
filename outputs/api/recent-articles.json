      "title": "Path planning of industrial robots based on the adaptive field cooperative sampling algorithm",
      "content": "For the low efficiency and poor generalization ability of path planning algorithm of industrial robots, this work proposes an adaptive field co-sampling algorithm (AFCS). Firstly, the environment complexity function is proposed to make full use of environment information and improve its generalization ability of the traditional rapidly random search tree algorithm (RRT) algorithm. Then an optimal sampling strategy is proposed to make the improvement of the efficiency and optimal direction of RRT algorithm. Finally, this article designs a collaborative extension strategy, which introduces the improved artificial potential field algorithm (APF) into the traditional RRT algorithm to determine the new nodes, so as to improve the orientation and expansion efficiency of the algorithm. The proposed AFCS algorithm completes simulation experiments in two environments with different complexity. Compared with the traditional RRT, RRT* and tRRT algorithm, the results show that the AFCS algorithm has achieved great improvement in environmental adaptability, stability and efficiency. At last, ROKAE industrial robot is taken as the object to build a simulation environment for the path planning, which further verifies the practicability of the algorithm.",

      "title": "Disentangling motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations and their modulation with rTMS",
      "content": "Cortical beta oscillations are central to motor control. These rhythms are modulated during movement preparation and execution, and are also sensitive to cognitive factors such as uncertainty, attention and reward prediction. However, the distinct motor and cognitive roles of cortical beta oscillations-roles that may inform condition-specific therapeutic strategies-remain unclear. This study aimed to disentangle the respective contributions of motor and cognitive functions, and to assess their modulation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Twenty-four healthy participants performed a visually cued reaching task in which directional uncertainty was dynamically manipulated by varying the number of targets in real-time. Reaction time was quantified as a behavioural measure. Three stimulation conditions were applied during the preparatory periods between the 'uncertainty' and 'go' cues: no stimulation, regular rTMS at each participant's individual beta frequency, and irregular rTMS. Electroencephalography was used to measure beta-band oscillatory activity. Our results showed that 'uncertainty' cues induced bilateral beta suppression, with greater uncertainty linked to smaller reductions in beta power. Movement-related beta modulation was lateralised to the hemisphere contralateral to the executing hand, where elevated beta power in the pre-'go' cue period predicted longer reaction times. Both regular and irregular rTMS significantly shortened reaction times and attenuated beta event-related desynchronisation. Reductions in beta desynchronisation correlated with improvements in reaction times, suggesting beta desynchronisation reflects a neural threshold for movement initiation. These findings indicate that cortical beta oscillations encode distinct motor and cognitive processes, and that beta frequency rTMS can modulate beta dynamics to facilitate faster movement initiation by lowering this neural threshold.",

      "title": "Drosophila maintain a consistent navigational goal angle for days to weeks",
      "content": "Past work has demonstrated that Drosophila can keep to a consistent navigational bearing for minutes to hours. Here, we ask whether they can do so over days to weeks. First, we describe an experimental rig that allows individual head-fixed Drosophila to live for at least two weeks within a virtual-reality environment. Flies walk on a spherical treadmill and receive sugar drops at defined moments as food. Individuals express robust circadian and sleep rhythms on these rigs. We further show that flies freely navigating an environment containing a single visual orienting cue (akin to the sun) will often pick a unique direction and walk forward along that direction for tens to hundreds of meters over days to weeks. This preferred direction can be considered a goal angle because individuals will repeatedly correct for experimentally induced virtual rotations away from this angle. Flies rely on the visual cue to effectively progress forward along the goal angle--walking in circles without it--and they return to walking forward along the same angle in the morning after spending a full night (twelve hours) in darkness without the cue. These results argue for the existence of navigation goals in the Drosophila brain with a persistence time of days to weeks. Furthermore, the technology introduced here may enable trained behaviors across thousands of reinforcement trials in Drosophila, a paradigm central to mammalian neuroscience yet absent in flies.",

      "title": "Separate Timescales for Spatial and Anatomical Information Processing of Body Stimuli",
      "content": "Observing different body stimuli can influence the speed and accuracy of our responses. Prior work indicates this effect is influenced by factors such as spatial congruence and perspective. We hypothesized that the influence of these factors would vary depending on the amount of time that participants had to process visual stimuli. Experiment 1 was a RT task (n = 29) with stimuli varying in spatial congruence (congruent, incongruent, neutral), perspective (first- or third-person), and stimulus type (body or control). Experiment 2 (n = 50) used the same stimuli in a \u201cForced Response\u201d paradigm, which controlled the time participants had to prepare a response. This allowed us to assess responses as a function of preparation time. Experiment 1 showed effects of spatial congruence, with longer RTs and more errors for spatially incongruent stimuli. This effect was greater for body stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that spatial information was processed faster than anatomical information, inducing incorrect responses at short preparation times for spatially incongruent body stimuli. There was little-to-no corresponding effect for control stimuli. Both experiments also showed weak-to-no effects of perspective, which appear to have been driven by spatial congruence. Our results indicate that spatial information is processed faster than anatomical information during observation of body stimuli. These data are consistent with the dual visual streams hypothesis, whereby spatial information would be processed rapidly via the dorsal stream, whereas anatomical processing would occur later via the ventral stream. These data also indicate differences in processing between body and control stimuli.",
