      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>For the past few months, I've been working on <strong>SottoMonte</strong>, an experimental web framework designed to push Hexagonal Architecture to its limits in Python.</p> <h3>What My Project Does</h3> <p>SottoMonte is a web framework that enforces a strict separation between business logic and infrastructure. Unlike traditional frameworks, the &quot;Application&quot; core contains pure logic with models defined in JSON schema and zero external dependencies. - <strong>Framework Layer</strong>: Acts as the link between Application and Infrastructure. - <strong>Infrastructure</strong>: Everything is a plugin (Starlette for the web, Redis/Supabase for data). - <strong>UI System</strong>: Instead of standard Jinja templates, it uses a system of XML Components rendered server-side. This feels similar to Android or modern JS frameworks (component-based), but it is entirely Python-driven.</p> <h3>Target Audience</h3> <p>This is currently an <strong>experimental/toy project</strong> meant for research and discussion. However, the design pattern is aimed at <strong>complex enterprise systems</strong> where long-term maintainability and decoupling are critical. It is likely &quot;over-engineered&quot; for simple blogs or scripts but explores how we might structure large-scale Python applications to be independent of their frameworks.</p> <h3>Comparison</h3> <p><strong>vs Django/FastAPI:</strong> My main frustration with frameworks like Django or FastAPI was the often inevitable coupling between business logic and infrastructure (e.g., relying heavily on ORMs or passing HTTP request objects deep into the service layer). - <strong>SottoMonte</strong> isolates the core logic completely; the core doesn't know it's running on the web or using a specific database. - <strong>UI Approach</strong>: While Django/Flask typically use text-based templating (Jinja2), SottoMonte uses structured XML widgets, allowing for a more component-driven UI development style on the server side.</p> <h3>Discussion</h3> <p>I know this approach is heavy on abstraction (e.g., repositories that treat GitHub APIs like SQL databases, UI composed of widgets). <strong>My question to you:</strong> For complex enterprise systems, do you think this level of strict abstraction is worth it? Or does the cognitive complexity outweigh the benefits of decoupling?</p> <p>Code: <a href=\"https://github.com/SottoMonte/frameworkk\">https://github.com/SottoMonte/frameworkk</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FungoNocivo\"> /u/FungoNocivo </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p4r5h6/showcase_an_experimental_hexagonal_architecture/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1p4r5h6/showcase_an_experimental_hexagonal_architecture/\">[comments]</a></span>",
