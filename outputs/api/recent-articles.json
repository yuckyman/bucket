      "title": "Endothelial tight junctions and cell-matrix adhesions reciprocally control blood-brain barrier integrity",
      "content": "Brain endothelial cells (ECs) rely on mechanical cues to provide a physical barrier that protects the brain. Yet how ECs integrate forces to establish and maintain the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the two main endothelial force-bearing systems, tight junctions and cell-matrix adhesions, reciprocally control BBB integrity. Using a combination of super-resolution imaging and biophysical techniques, we reveal increasing mechanical loads on cell-cell junctions vs. cell-matrix adhesions in human stem cell-derived ECs during BBB maturation. This force redistribution is enabled by cytoskeletal remodeling, a compacted pattern of the tight junction protein claudin 5, and the emergence of specialised perinuclear cell-matrix adhesions. Mechanistically, we find an inverse relationship between claudin-5 levels and the expression of key cell-matrix adhesion proteins zyxin and vinculin in vitro and in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that this mechanobiological signature associated with BBB maturation is reversed upon BBB dysfunction after seizures in mice and in human patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Collectively, our findings establish a novel interplay between mechanoresponsive elements in brain ECs, with implications for BBB stabilisation therapy in epilepsy.",

      "title": "Dopaminergic neurons are vulnerable to dysregulation of YEATS2-dependent calcium homeostasis",
      "content": "YEATS2 is a ubiquitously expressed chromatin-associated factor that we recently identified as a novel regulator of dopaminergic (DAergic) synaptic integrity, though its mechanism of action remained unclear. Using Drosophila, we show that neuronal depletion of YEATS2 reshapes the brain transcriptome, marked by downregulation of metabolic genes and upregulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These changes coincide with elevated intracellular calcium, neurobehavioral deficits, and selective DA neuron loss. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the store-operated calcium entry channel Orai restored calcium homeostasis and rescued DA neuron survival. Our findings define a YEATS2-dependent epigenetic-calcium axis that governs DA neuron vulnerability.",

      "title": "Modeling interaction between focal cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer`s Disease Pathology in an APP/PS1 Mouse Model",
      "content": "Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and is a known risk factor for Alzheimer`s Disease (AD) development. One of the characteristics of AD is the accumulation of {beta}-amyloid peptide due to the proteolysis of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the protein Presenilin 1 (PS1). The study of interaction between ischemia and AD has been limited due to lack of experimental models. The current study describes a novel model utilizing a brief transient ischemia (15 min MCAO) in an AD mouse model to assess mechanistic interaction. Here we investigate the effects of increased {beta}-amyloid peptide on motor coordination, behavioral and cellular memory, when subjected to brief focal ischemia. APP/PS1 or Wt male mice are initially subjected to either a 15-minute MCAO or Sham surgery. Injury volume using MRI is assessed at 3-days using T2 imaging and demonstrates that injury magnitude was not different between Wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. We observed that 15 min MCAO did not cause significant motor deficits in either WT or APP/PS1 mice, as measured by open field and tapered balance beam. Short-term memory was assessed 7 days after recovery from brief MCAO using the contextual fear conditioning task. APP/PS1 mice exhibited intact memory at 3 months of age and Wt mice also having intact memory 7 days after 15 min MCAO. In contrast, APP/PS1 + 15 min MCAO mice exhibited a significant reduction in freezing behavior suggesting impairment in short term memory. Consistent with our contextual fear conditioning, we observed impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in APP/PS1 + 15 min MCAO compared to their sham counterparts. Remarkably, we observed an additive effect of ischemia and AD, with cellular and behavior memory deficits observed in APP/PS1 mice exposed to brief ischemia that does not cause symptoms in WT mice. This study represents an important new model to be study the mechanistic link between ischemia and accelerated AD progression.",

A new experiment that mismatches the speed of visual cues and physical movement in rats shows that hippocampal network dynamics rapidly alternate between these functions within cycles of the 8-Hz theta oscillation. In one portion of the theta cycle, the internal sense of location drives the phase of firing independent of visual cues or self-motion cues, whereas in the other portion, the phases depend on a match of visual and self-motion inputs, manifesting as a reduction in place cell activity when there is a mismatch.",
