      "title": "A neural circuit for female-specific defensive homeostasis in risk assessment",
      "content": "Risk assessment in defensive behavior is an adaptive mechanism shaped by natural selection, enabling individuals to evaluate potential threats and thereby maintain defensive homeostasis. Although risk assessment is essential for survival, it remains unknown whether specific neural circuits maintain their behavioral homeostasis in a sex-specific manner. Here, we show that visual survival threats activated cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R)-expressing neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), initiating consistent risk assessment in both sexes. Deletion of CB1R in SC GABAergic neurons female-specifically impairs risk assessment by disinhibiting GABA release in SC-lateral habenula (LHb) projections, resulting in abnormally shortened risk assessment. Furthermore, loss of CB1R in SC GABAergic neurons increases the occurrence of abnormal spontaneous behavior following chronic stress exclusively in females. Our findings revealed a female-specific CB1R-modulated SC-LHb GABAergic circuit crucial for maintaining defensive homeostasis in risk assessment, highlighting how disruptions in this circuit underlie deficits in risk assessment and adaptive stress coping.",

      "title": "Prolonged oscillating kisspeptin neuron activity underlies the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge in mice",
      "content": "The population of kisspeptin neurons located in the rostral periventricular area of the third ventricle (RP3V) is thought to have a key role in generating the GnRH surge that triggers ovulation. Using a modified GCaMP fibre photometry procedure, we have been able to record the in vivo population activity of RP3VKISS neurons across the estrous cycle of female mice. A marked increase in GCaMP activity was detected beginning on the afternoon of proestrus that lasted in total for 13{+/-}1 hours. This was comprised of slow baseline oscillations with a period of 91{+/-}4 min and associated with high frequency rapid transients. Very little oscillating baseline or transient activity was detected at other stages of the estrous cycle. Concurrent blood sampling showed that the peak of the LH surge occurred 3.5{+/-}1.1 h after the first baseline RP3VKISS neuron baseline oscillation on the afternoon of proestrus. The time of onset of RP3VKISS neuron oscillations varied between mice and across subsequent proestrous stages in the same mice. To assess the impact of estradiol on RP3VKISS neuron activity, mice were ovariectomized and given an incremental estradiol replacement regimen. Minimal patterned GCaMP activity was found in OVX mice, and this was not changed acutely by any of the estradiol treatments. However, on the afternoon of the expected LH surge, the same oscillating baseline activity with associated transients occurred for 7.1{+/-}0.5 h. These observations reveal an unexpected prolonged oscillatory pattern of RP3VKISS neuron activity that is dependent on estrogen and underlies the preovulatory LH surge as well as potentially other facets of reproductive behavior.",

      "content": "Handwritten Braille character recognition presents a significant challenge in the field of assistive technology, especially with the inclusion of various linguistic scripts such as Kannada. The data set is uniquely curated, combining ground-truth data from Kaggle and real-world samples collected from blind schools, segmented into vowels and consonants. The proposed system demonstrates exceptional performance in feature extraction, classification accuracy, and addressing spatial misalignments in...",

Our results highlight the importance of built-in accessibility features for users with visual impairments. As additional technology-based solutions are developed, it is essential that blind and low vision users, including rehabilitation professionals, are meaningfully included within design.",

      "content": "The development of highly sensitive, wide linear-range flexible pressure sensors is crucial for practical applications in human-computer interaction, physiological signal detection, and motion monitoring. However, traditional flexible pressure sensors often suffer from limited compressibility in their structural design, resulting in rapid saturation of the detection range and low sensitivity, which hinder their commercial viability. In this study, we propose a straightforward electrospinning...",

Yet, increasing the resolution of these displays requires increasing the number of individually addressable actuators while simultaneously reducing their total surface area, power consumption, and weight, challenges most evidently reflected in the dearth of affordable multiline braille displays....",
