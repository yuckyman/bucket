      "title": "Advancing Cardiac Organoid Engineering Through Application of Biophysical Forces",
      "content": "Cardiac organoids represent an important bioengineering opportunity in the development of models to study human heart pathophysiology. By incorporating multiple cardiac cell types in three-dimensional culture and developmentally-guided biochemical signaling, cardiac organoids recapitulate numerous features of heart tissue. However, cardiac tissue also experiences a variety of mechanical forces as the heart develops and over the course of each contraction cycle. It is now clear that these forces impact cellular specification, phenotype, and function, and should be incorporated into the engineering of cardiac organoids in order to generate better models. In this review, we discuss strategies for engineering cardiac organoids and report the effects of organoid design on the function of cardiac cells. We then discuss the mechanical environment of the heart, including forces arising from tissue elasticity, contraction, blood flow, and stretch, and report on efforts to mimic these biophysical cues in cardiac organoids. Finally, we review emerging areas of cardiac organoid research, for the study of cardiac development, the formation of multi-organ models, and the simulation of the effects of spaceflight on cardiac tissue, and consider how these investigations might benefit from the inclusion of mechanical cues.",

      "title": "Earable Multimodal Sensing and Stimulation: A Prospective Toward Unobtrusive Closed-Loop Biofeedback",
      "content": "The human ear has emerged as a bidirectional gateway to the brain's and body's signals. Recent advances in around-the-ear and in-ear sensors have enabled the assessment of biomarkers and physiomarkers derived from brain and cardiac activity using ear-electroencephalography (ear-EEG), photoplethysmography (ear-PPG), and chemical sensing of analytes from the ear, with ear-EEG having been taken beyond-the-lab to outer space. Parallel advances in non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques have leveraged the ear's access to two cranial nerves to modulate brain and body activity. The vestibulocochlear nerve stimulates the auditory cortex and limbic system with sound, while the auricular branch of the vagus nerve indirectly but significantly couples to the autonomic nervous system and cardiac output. Acoustic and current mode stimuli delivered using discreet and unobtrusive earables are an active area of research, aiming to make biofeedback and bioelectronic medicine deliverable outside of the clinic, with remote and continuous monitoring of therapeutic responsivity and long-term adaptation. Leveraging recent advances in ear-EEG, transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS), and unobtrusive acoustic stimulation, we review accumulating evidence that combines their potential into an integrated earable platform for closed-loop multimodal sensing and neuromodulation, towards personalized and holistic therapies that are near, in- and around-the-ear.",

      "title": "ADHD Medications and Preadolescent Brain Structure: Patterns of Cortical Attenuation from the ABCD Study",
      "content": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in the U.S., and the stimulant and nonstimulant medications used to treat ADHD are among the most widely prescribed treatments in youth. Stimulants--including amphetamine-based (AMP) and methylphenidate-based (MPH) medications--act primarily on dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, while nonstimulants (NS) more selectively target noradrenergic pathways. Although pharmacotherapy is the most clinically effective treatment, its neurostructural effects remain poorly understood. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study(R)), we used a machine learning approach to identify neuroanatomical targets of medications, followed by linear mixed-effects modeling to estimate the effects of ADHD status and medication class (AMP, MPH, NS) on cortical thickness, surface area, and cortical and subcortical volumes. ADHD was not associated with statistically significant differences; however, a consistent pattern emerged in which AMP and MPH effects attenuated ADHD effects, suggesting that stimulant medications may attenuate ADHD-related cortical patterns. NS medications showed a similar, albeit weaker, effect pattern. Notably, AMP and/or MPH use was associated with significant effects in the right entorhinal cortex and the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus, potentially reflecting overcompensatory effects, as well as in the left posterior cingulate, possibly indicating de novo medication-related differences.",
