      "title": "Decoding the Valence of Developmental Social Behavior: Dopamine Governs Social Motivation Deficits in Autism",
      "content": "The social motivation theory posits that core social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) arise from impaired social valence assignment during the social critical period, yet the specific dopaminergic mechanisms governing this process remain unclear. We combined high-resolution behavioral sequencing (Social-seq) with fiber photometry to resolve nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine during naturalistic juvenile interactions. Sex-divergent social strategies emerged: males exhibited peer play-dominant interactions with action-contingent dopamine release, while females favored environmental exploration with attenuated social dopamine. Shank3-deficient juveniles exhibited a triad of dopaminergic dysregulation-blunted signaling during social investigation, pathological inversion during active play, and hyper-responsive to non-social stimuli-recapitulating ASD-like phenotypes. Closed-loop activation of dopamine during play rescued social deficits, establishing a causal link between phasic dopaminergic signaling and social motivation. These findings identify NAc dopamine as a dynamic encoder of social valence and suggest that temporally precise modulation of dopaminergic circuits may offer therapeutic leverage for ASD-related social impairments.",

      "title": "Advancing Human iPSC-Derived Motor Neuron Models Using Glutamatergic Modulators for Synaptic Function Studies",
      "content": "Understanding human synapse structure and function at nanoscale resolution requires experimental systems that support both high-quality imaging and robust synaptogenesis. While brain tissue and primary neuronal cultures have been widely used, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer key advantages: they enable patient-specific modeling and provide a renewable source of human neurons without relying on animal models. However, reproducible synapse formation in iPSC-derived neurons, particularly motor neurons (MNs), remains challenging due to variable differentiation efficiencies and low synaptic density. Here, we optimized MN differentiation to enhance synaptogenesis and enable high-resolution structural analysis using cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Within 28 days, human iPSC-derived MNs developed into morphologically and functionally mature neuronal networks, characterized by phase-bright somata, elongated axons, and dense axodendritic branching. To further promote synaptic connectivity, we applied the glutamatergic modulators CX516 and CDPPB during differentiation. Their effects were validated by immunolabeling of synaptic markers, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, live-cell synaptic vesicle recycling assays, and ultrastructural imaging, including cryo-ET. This combined approach of optimized differentiation and targeted neuromodulation yielded reproducible MN networks with enhanced synaptic density and function, providing a robust in vitro platform for investigating human MN physiology, synaptic mechanisms, and disease-relevant synaptopathies.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of adaptive interlimb coordination to sudden ground loss: a neuromusculoskeletal modeling study",
      "content": "Mammals exhibit robust walking across diverse environments, a capability largely attributed to central pattern generators (CPGs) in the spinal cord. Afferent feedback modulates CPG output and plays a critical role in adaptive locomotion, yet its specific contributions remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we used a neuromusculoskeletal model to simulate hindlimb locomotion in spinalized cats encountering a hole and experiencing a sudden loss of ground support, as described in prior experimental studies. The model couples a trunk-and-hindlimb musculoskeletal system to a pair of two-level, half-center CPGs - one for each hindlimb. The model reproduced the observed adaptive interlimb coordination that allows cats to maintain walking after the sudden loss of ground support. Notably, the adaptive response emerged without re-optimizing parameters, which were tuned for steady walking in an environment without holes. Nullcline analysis based on dynamical systems theory revealed that afferent feedback mechanisms controlling the transitions between fast and slow neuronal dynamics facilitated adaptive interlimb coordination. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how spinal feedback circuits support robust locomotion through dynamic interactions between the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system, and the environment.",

      "title": "The anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug valproic acid attracts C. elegans and activates chemosensory neurons via a cGMP signaling pathway",
      "content": "Valproic acid (VPA) is a drug with both anticonvulsant and antimanic properties. It has been widely prescribed to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and other neuropsychiatric conditions for decades, but its molecular mode of action in the brain is not fully known. Moreover, prenatal exposure to this drug is linked to developmental anomalies, cognitive deficits, and an increased risk of autism. To determine VPA's effect on the nervous system without requiring systemic drug application and inducing toxic effects, we exploited the well-characterized chemotaxis behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that C. elegans are attracted to VPA, and this behavior is missing in animals lacking the tax-4 ion channel and the tax-4-expressing AWC chemosensory neurons. To test the idea that VPA directly activates the AWC neurons, we performed calcium imaging studies in a line expressing GCaMP6s in all amphid chemosensory neurons in the head. We found that VPA evoked calcium transients consistently in the AWC neurons and variably in AWB and ASH. As cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, the active state of tax-4 increases upon the binding of cGMP. Within the worm's chemosensory nervous system, receptor guanylate cyclases (rGCs) facilitate the synthesis of cGMP and serve as chemoreceptors for various chemical cues. By performing chemotaxis assays and calcium imaging experiments with rGC mutants against VPA, we found that odr-1 and gcy-28 are essential for mediating VPA attraction, as their absence disrupts both behavior and control AWC calcium transients. However, given their broad use in chemosensation, odr-1 and gcy-28 most likely act as downstream effectors rather than as direct targets. These findings compelled us to investigate whether chemoreceptors belonging to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family contribute to VPA sensing. We approached this hypothesis by conducting chemotaxis assays with G mutants and identified several (odr-3, egl-30, gpa-2;gpa-3) whose absence leads to a loss of VPA attraction. Thus, future studies should focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which GPCRs contribute to VPA sensing and cGMP signaling.",

      "title": "Neurogenesis Leads Early Development in Zebrafish",
      "content": "Vertebrate early neurogenesis is a highly conserved process fundamental to brain function and the emergence of intelligence. However, the cellular dynamics bridging gastrulation and organogenesis remain elusive due to observational challenges. We developed a live-cell imaging platform for transgenic zebrafish that provides, for the first time, a continuous reconstruction of early neurogenesis across subcellular to organismal scales. Our analysis reveals that neurogenesis is a precisely orchestrated process. Neuronal cell bodies initially coalesce into discrete, linearly arranged clusters extending from the brain along the spinal cord. From these hubs, axons radiate outward to innervate the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, including the yolk sac surface. A primary pioneer neuron projects from the brain, coursing ventrally in parallel to the body axis. Secondary neurons then interconnect, forming a pervasive network that is subsequently refined through selective axonal apoptosis. The emergence of frequent Ca2+ flashes only after structural maturation indicates that functionality is contingent upon an established scaffold. We also observe concurrent material transport and a slow, directional flow of Ca2+ along axons, suggesting complementary signaling modalities. Furthermore, neurogenesis exhibits precise spatiotemporal coupling with histogenesis, particularly with the developing lateral line and vasculature. Our work, with refined spatial and time resolution, defines the kinetic pathway of early neurogenesis and underscores the critical interplay of subsystems in embryogenesis, offering fundamental insights for neural health and bio-inspired intelligence.",

      "content": "Deficient extinction learning and memory are hypothesized mechanisms for pathological anxiety that are associated with sleep disturbance. fMRI neural activations to threat conditioning, extinction learning, and extinction recall were measured. Activations were compared, in persons with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), between those with moderate to severe Insomnia Disorder (ID) and those with absent or sub-threshold ID. Relationships of activations with measures of sleep quality and physiology were examined. Between-group comparisons and whole-sample correlation with sleep parameters were examined in relation to large-scale brain networks using a liberal cluster-determining threshold. Localized activations were then identified using familywise error correction. Activations to the reinforced stimulus (CS+) that increased from the beginning to end (across) threat conditioning were more extensive within the GAD+ID group. Increased activations to the CS+ across extinction learning were greater within the GAD-ID than the GAD+ID group, and delayed 24h in the latter. Greater sleep efficiency was associated with decreased activations across threat conditioning, but with increased activations across extinction learning. Better sleep quality promoted greater engagement of neural substrates of extinction learning. The GAD+ID group failed to engage brain areas supporting extinction learning immediately following threat conditioning, but did so when stimuli were again presented following a delay.",

The neural mechanisms underlying this process and the sources of landmark signals remain unknown in mammals. Here, we simultaneously recorded single neurons across five parahippocampal regions in rats navigating a virtual reality environment that preserved natural locomotion. Area 29e, an understudied parahippocampal field, displayed strong locking to visual landmarks under conditions in which neurons in the other regions, such as the medial entorhinal cortex, decoupled their spatial firing from the landmarks. Compared to the other regions, area 29e neurons also displayed weaker theta modulation, stronger gamma rhythmicity, stronger egocentric head-direction tuning, and enhanced landmark contrast sensitivity. The loss of landmark anchoring in non-29e parahippocampal neurons was preceded by a decline of gamma-band influence from 29e to medial entorhinal cortex. Together, these findings position 29e as a specialized visuospatial hub that may carry landmark signals for anchoring parahippocampal representations of space to the external world.",
