      "title": "Musical Structure Influences the Perception of Sound Location",
      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

      "title": "Return of the GEDAI: Unsupervised EEG Denoising based on Leadfield Filtering",
      "content": "Current electroencephalogram (EEG) denoising methods struggle to remove the complex physiological and environmental artifacts typical of real-world settings, which both hinders the isolation of true neural activity and limits the technology's translational potential. We present the Generalized Eigenvalue De-Artifacting Instrument (GEDAI), a novel algorithm for denoising highly contaminated EEG. GEDAI employs leadfield filtering to selectively remove noise and artifacts that diverge from a theoretically defined EEG forward model. This approach offers unique advantages over existing solutions, including 1) denoising of highly corrupt recordings without clean reference data, 2) single-step correction of artifactual epochs and bad channels, 3) unsupervised detection of brain and noise components based on the signal and noise subspace alignment index (SENSAI). In ground-truth simulations with synthetic and empirical EEG contaminated with realistic artifacts (EOG, EMG, noise), GEDAI globally outperformed leading denoising techniques based on principal component analysis (ASR) and independent component analysis (IClabel, MARA), revealing large effect sizes in challenging scenarios with simultaneous artifact mixtures, low signal-to-noise ratio (-9 dB), and high temporal contamination (up to 100%). Its superior denoising also enhanced neurobehavioral predictions, yielding highest accuracies in ERP classification and brain fingerprinting. GEDAIs autonomy, computational speed and noise-resilience could find future applications in 1) real-world medical, mobile and dry electrode EEG recordings 2) magnetoenecephalography (MEG) denoising (given the shared M/EEG forward model), and 3) real-time brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). The Matlab code for GEDAI is available as an open-source EEGLAB plugin at https://github.com/neurotuning/GEDAI-master",

      "title": "The hallmark of colour in EEG signal",
      "content": "Our perception of the world is inherently colourful, and colour provides well-documented benefits for vision: it helps us see things quicker and remember them better. We hypothesised that colour is not only central to perception but also a rich and decodable source of information in electroencephalography (EEG) signal recorded non-invasively from the scalp. Previous work has shown that brain activity carries colour information for uniform patches, but it remains unclear whether this extends to natural, complex images where colour is not explicitly cued. To investigate this, we analysed the THINGS EEG dataset, comprising 64-channel recordings from participants viewing 1,800 distinct objects (16,740 images) for 100 ms each, totalling over 82,000 trials. We established a perceptual colour ground truth through a psychophysical experiment in which participants viewed each image for 100 ms and selected perceived colours from a 13-option palette. An artificial neural network trained to predict these scene-level colour distributions directly from EEG signals showed that colour information was robustly decodable (average F-score of 0.5). We next modelled the interaction between colour and object perception in neuroimaging decoding. Images were segmented using the Segment Anything Model (SAM), each object was assigned a representative colour, and features were extracted from these colour-augmented images using CLIP vision encoders. We trained an EEG encoder, CUBE (ColoUr and oBjEct decoding), to align features in both object and colour spaces. Across EEG and MEG datasets in a 200-class recognition task, incorporating colour improved decoding accuracy by about 5%. Together, these findings demonstrate that EEG signal recorded during natural vision carries substantial colour information that interacts with object perception. Modelling this mutual interaction enhances neural decoding performance.",
