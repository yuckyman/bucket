      "title": "What are the virtual reality solutions for dual-task intervention to promote health in aging? A scoping review",
      "content": "IntroductionCognitive-motor dual-task (CMDT) performance is crucial for everyday activities, particularly in older adults who commonly experience deficiencies in cognitive and motor domains. These impairments compromise daily functioning, causing a decrease in quality of life. However, traditional assessment and training methods face significant limitations. Conventional protocols often exhibit limited ecological validity, as they fail to replicate real-world performance demands adequately. Moreover, they are characterized by substantial methodological heterogeneity and offer restricted capacity for real-time performance monitoring and the delivery of personalized feedback. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a promising approach by creating controlled, real-life environments that enable precise assessment and personalized training. However, VR-based CMDT remains largely unexplored. This review evaluates current VR solutions for CMDT, examining assessment, and intervention designs.MethodsA scoping review was conducted on April 17, 2023 (and updated on January 21, 2025), following the PRISMA for Scoping Review guidelines, on three databases: Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed. We included original articles, based on the following criteria: English-language; original research articles reporting empirical data from experimental, quasi-experimental, or observational studies; articles employing CMDT assessment or training; use of VR-based applications during a CMDT; older population participants (\u226565 years). Reviews, meta-analyses, editorials, conceptual articles, case studies, and short papers were excluded.ResultsOf 2,649 papers, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria: 17 assessment and four training studies. Research focused on healthy older adults and individuals with early cognitive decline, sensory deficits, and those at fall risk. Assessment studies mainly employed immersive and semi-immersive systems simulating realistic scenarios in virtual environments, primarily using \u201cwalking while\u201d paradigms with cognitive tasks. Training studies frequently utilized non-immersive or semi-immersive solutions with less naturalistic environments, demonstrating improvements in gait parameters, dual-task performance, motor functions, and cognitive abilities. Substantial methodological heterogeneity was observed in intervention duration, frequency, and DT cost calculations, with limited attention to user experience evaluation.DiscussionVR-based CMDT applications show promise for assessment and intervention in aging. However, significant gaps exist regarding the lack of standardized methodological approaches, ecological validity, and user-centered design considerations. Future research should address these limitations to enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of VR-based CMDT interventions.",

      "content": "ObjectiveTo compare demographics, comorbidities, neurologic symptoms, quality of life, and cognitive outcomes among adult individuals with neurologic manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC) across countries with varying income levels: the United States (U.S.), Colombia, Nigeria, and India.MethodsIn this multi-country observational study, participants were evaluated in hospital clinics and recruited from institutional databases between 2020 and 2025. Patients were categorized as post-hospitalization Neuro-PASC (PNP) or non-hospitalized Neuro-PASC (NNP). Cognitive assessments were performed using the NIH Toolbox (U.S. and Colombia), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Nigeria), or the Mini-Mental State Examination (India).ResultsA total of 3,157 participants were enrolled (652 PNP; 2,505 NNP). PNP patients were predominantly male except in the US, while NNP patients were predominantly female, except in India. The most frequent neurologic symptoms were brain fog, myalgia, dizziness, headache, and sensory disturbances, with frequency highest in the U.S. and lowest in India. There were significant differences for most neurologic and non-neurologic symptoms of PASC, driven by higher frequencies in U.S. and Colombia in both PNP and NNP cohorts. In addition, cognitive impairment measured with different instruments varied across countries for both PNP and NNP groups. Multiple correspondence analysis showed clustering of symptom burden between U.S./Colombia and Nigeria/India.ConclusionNeuro-PASC presents globally but symptom burden, and psychological distress vary across regions, likely influenced by sociocultural factors, healthcare access, and diagnostic tools. These findings highlight the need for culturally-adapted screening and post-COVID care worldwide.",

      "title": "Dynamic sensor adaptation based on efferent feedback for adaptive bio-inspired sound source localization",
      "content": "Auditory perception and localization are fundamental tasks for many species, allowing them to detect, identify, and spatially localize sound sources in their environment. While biological systems have evolved sophisticated neural mechanisms for auditory adaptation, artificial auditory systems still struggle to match their performance, particularly in dynamic and noisy environments. Our research focuses on whether sensor adaptation, driven by efferent feedback from the processing stage to the sensory stage, can improve localization performance. Inspired by human sound source localization based on interaural level differences (ILD) and efferent feedback, the proposed neuromorphic system architecture is composed of two bio-inspired acoustic sensors connected to a neural processing stage, represented by two neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and two neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO). The LSO neuron response was analyzed in the following ways: (i) using measured sensor responses at different ILD without efferent feedback and with a fixed local feedback for each sensor measurement; (ii) simulated with synthetically generated sounds with varying ILDs for four different feedback configurations from the LSO neuron to the acoustic sensors. Results from (i) showed how the feedback tuning can be used to overcome mismatches due to fabrication tolerances between different MEMS sensors, and (ii) showed the influence of different feedback configurations and simulation parameters on the LSO neuron response with respect to different ILDs.",

      "title": "Altered static and dynamic functional network connectivity between subcortical nuclei and cortical regions of the default mode network in type 2 diabetes mellitus",
      "content": "IntroductionDisruptions in functional connectivity (FC) within the default mode network (DMN) are well established as a key neuropathology underlying cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Subcortical nuclei, including the basal forebrain (BF) and mediodorsal thalamus, play critical roles in regulating DMN-associated cognitive processes and are particularly vulnerable to hyperglycemia and brain insulin resistance. However, the specific FC patterns between these subcortical nuclei and DMN cortical regions in patients with T2DM, as well as their potential associations with cognitive impairment, remain incompletely elucidated.MethodsEighty-two patients with T2DM and 79 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Clinical data, neuropsychological assessments, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were collected from all participants. Resting-state (rs-FNC) and dynamic (dFNC) functional network connectivity analyses were performed to characterize connectivity between subcortical nuclei and DMN cortical regions. Correlation analyses explored associations between FNC metrics showing significant intergroup differences and participants\u2019 clinical and cognitive parameters.Resultsrs-FNC analysis revealed decreased FC between the BF and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dMPFC), the BF and the temporal pole, and the dMPFC and the anteromedial prefrontal cortex in patients with T2DM (network-based statistic correction; edge p\u202f<\u202f0.001, component p\u202f<\u202f0.05). dFNC analyses indicated increased frequency and prolonged mean dwell time (MDT) of State 1 (high-frequency low-connectivity), as well as decreased frequency and shortened MDT of State 2 (high-frequency high-connectivity) compared with HCs (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Reduced FC between the dMPFC and BF was positively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r\u202f=\u202f0.353, p\u202f=\u202f0.001), whereas frequency (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.434, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and MDT (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.376, p\u202f=\u202f0.001) of State 2 were negatively correlated with T2DM disease duration after Bonferroni correction.ConclusionThese findings indicate that T2DM duration correlates with reduced highly efficient DMN connectivity, and that the BF may regulate cognitive function via the dMPFC subsystem. The results reveal temporal and functional specificity in abnormal DMN connectivity in patients with T2DM and enrich the neural atlas of DMN dysfunction in this population.",

      "title": "Dynamic mode decomposition of resting-state fMRI revealing abnormal brain region features in schizophrenia",
      "content": "Extracting features from abnormal brain regions in schizophrenia patients\u2019 brain images holds significant importance for aiding diagnosis. However, existing methods remained limited in simultaneously capturing spatiotemporal information. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) effectively extracts spatiotemporal features from dynamic systems, making it suitable for time-series signals such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrocorticography (ECoG). This study utilized resting-state fMRI data from 68 healthy subjects and 68 schizophrenia patients. The DMD method was employed to extract the mean amplitude of dynamic patterns as features, with feature selection conducted via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. A support vector machine (SVM) was further employed to validate the predictive capability of the selected features across subject groups. Based on the LASSO screening, we identified brain regions exhibiting significant inter-group differences in mean amplitude, designated these as abnormal regions, and subsequently analyzed their functional deviations. The DMD method not only provided explicit temporal dynamic representations of brain activity but also supported signal reconstruction and prediction, thereby enhancing feature interpretability. Results demonstrated that DMD effectively extracted mean amplitude features from fMRI data. Combined with LASSO and SVM, it enabled the identification of abnormal brain regions and functional abnormalities in schizophrenia patients. Furthermore, this method captured frequency-dependent signal patterns, with extracted features correlating with both regional activation intensity and functional connectivity. This approach provides novel insights for exploring potential biomarkers of psychiatric disorders.",

      "content": "C. elegans is a model organism in many biological domains, such as genetics, neurophysiology, and behavioral ecology. Despite our relatively deep knowledge of the neuronal, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying C. elegans communication, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of emergent group-level dynamics. We review the literature on collective behavior of C. elegans by categorizing works in this relatively small research field along three main axes corresponding to primary collective responses: aggregation, swarming, and collective decision-making. Through an analysis of the methods and scientific contributions of these works, we develop a critical perspective that points to important gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlaying the emergence of collective responses. We discuss the consequences of the lack of evidence concerning the effect of population density on the emergence of specific group dynamics, and the relatively limited knowledge related to how self-generated pheromones regulate local interactions and contribute to the emergence of group responses. We elaborate on the methodological problems of developing experimental scenarios to disentangle causal relationships between population density, pheromone-based interactions and collective responses. We propose to overcome these limitations with an interdisciplinary approach based on the use of in vivo experiments, mathematical and computer-based models.",

      "title": "The sound of manufactured music: Reviewing the role of artificial stimuli in music cognition research.",
      "content": "Having participants listen and react to musical stimuli is one of music cognition\u2019s foundational methods. Whereas most researchers have used stimuli adapted from existing musical traditions in such work, others have incorporated artificial stimuli (i.e., stimuli generated specifically for research that are not borrowed from any existing musical system) into their research designs. No review of this growing literature on artificial stimuli exists, leaving open the question of how useful they are in helping formulate and test research questions in music cognition. To this end, a systematic narrative review of empirical studies utilizing artificial musical stimuli (N = 52) was conducted. Comparing these studies to analogous works involving conventional stimuli in the areas of music preference, music learning, and musical emotion revealed the power of artificial stimuli in reducing concerns regarding stimulus familiarity and musical enculturation confounds, as well as in refining theory by reiterating the need for the development of composite predictive models in music cognition. This review also suggests that using artificial stimuli has the potential to help clarify the neurological and sociocognitive factors surrounding music listening behavior. Furthermore, because artificial stimuli are not tied to any existing sociocultural musical system, they may also lead to more generalizable findings. This enhanced generalizability may also coincide with expanded inclusivity, toward which the field of music cognition (and psychology more generally) are increasingly striving. Other potential uses, benefits, and limitations of artificial musical stimuli are discussed, as well as recommendations for researchers seeking to utilize such stimuli in future studies.

      "title": "Music-evoked nostalgia and charitable giving: A cross-cultural study in the United States and Mexico.",
      "content": "Nostalgia, a past-oriented emotion characterized by complex affective responses, is a pervasive and fundamental human experience. Prior research has demonstrated that nostalgia serves various socioemotional functions, such as promoting a sense of belonging, enhancing one\u2019s perception of meaning in life, and boosting self-esteem. These positive emotions, in turn, can prompt individuals to engage in other-oriented behaviors, such as charitable giving. Building on this view, this study examined the impact of listening to nostalgic music on donation decisions. Undergraduate students in the United States (n = 83) and Mexico (n = 97) voluntarily participated in an online, one-on-one, experiment in which they listened to a series of self-selected nostalgic musical pieces and participated in a donation dictator game. Results indicated a significant relationship between music-evoked nostalgia and the amount of subsequent donations. Moreover, the study also found that individual differences in empathy, agreeableness (one of the Big Five personality traits), and perceived financial well-being also influenced the participants\u2019 donation decisions. Notably, the effects of these factors showed slight variations across the U.S. and Mexican samples, suggesting the role of culture in individual donation decisions.

      "title": "Preferred music listening does not affect cognitive inhibition in young and older adults.",
      "content": "Previous literature has found links between music listening and cognitive performance. Specifically, background music may play a role in modulating cognitive inhibition. However, determining what type of background music affects cognitive inhibition throughout the lifespan has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect that listening to preferred music has on cognitive inhibition in healthy young and healthy older adults. We hypothesized that there will be no differences in accuracy or reaction time when listening to preferred music, neutral music, or no music during Stroop task performance in both young and older adults, but young adults will demonstrate better performance on the Stroop task compared to older adults regardless of the music condition. Thirty young adults and thirteen older adults completed the Stroop task. Three conditions of words were presented randomly: neutral (infrequent words sol, helot, eft, and abjure presented in different colors), congruent (color of word matches the word), and incongruent (color of the word does not match the word itself). The music listening order was also randomized to minimize order effects. Results revealed that older adults were slower and more accurate that young adults across all music and Stroop conditions. Conclusions indicate that listening to music neither improved or hindered cognitive inhibition in the Stroop task in young and older adults.

      "title": "Absolute pitch: A literature review of underlying factors, with special regard to music pedagogy.",
      "content": "Absolute pitch (AP) is a fairly rare and special phenomenon that has relevance for musicology, psychology, genetics, and neuroscience. AP possessors are able to identify the pitch of an isolated sound or to produce that sound without a reference point. The authors\u2019 aim is to review the literature on AP. The phenomenon of AP was described in the era of Mozart, but it was only in the last decades of the 19th century that it became the focus of research. The standardization of the tuning system and organized music education underlied the interest in AP, and Bachem\u2019s tone chroma concept was relevant as well. The prevalence of AP is estimated to be between 0.01% and 1% in the general population, however, larger-scale epidemiological studies are lacking. AP\u2019s prevalence is much higher in special groups, such as among trained musicians, relatives of AP possessors, blind persons, people native in tonal languages, Asian music students or musicians, and those with an autism spectrum disorder. The genetic and environmental factors behind this ability are briefly summarized, followed by a detailed discussion of the solf\u00e8ge methods (movable-do and fixed-do systems) that can facilitate the development of AP.

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19203v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Olfactory cues can enhance immersion in interactive media, yet smell remains rare because it is difficult to author and synchronize with dynamic video. Prior olfactory interfaces rely on designer triggers and fixed event-to-odor mappings that do not scale to unconstrained content. This work examines whether semantic planning for smell is intelligible to people before physical scent delivery. We present a video-to-scent planning pipeline that separates visual semantic extraction using a vision-language model from semantic-to-olfactory inference using a large language model. Two survey studies compare system-generated scent plans with over-inclusive and naive baselines. Results show consistent preference for plans that prioritize perceptually salient cues and align scent changes with visible actions, supporting semantic planning as a foundation for future olfactory media systems.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19171v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: While generative AI enables high-fidelity UI generation from text prompts, users struggle to articulate design intent and evaluate or refine results-creating gulfs of execution and evaluation. To understand the information needed for UI generation, we conducted a thematic analysis of UI prompting guidelines, identifying key design semantics and discovering that they are hierarchical and interdependent. Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement. Our work demonstrates how explicit semantic representation enables systematic and explainable exploration of design possibilities in AI-driven UI design.",

      "content": "arXiv:2601.19168v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Blind and visually impaired (BVI) computer science students face systematic barriers when learning data structures: current accessibility approaches typically translate diagrams into alternative text, focusing on visual appearance rather than preserving the underlying structure essential for conceptual understanding. More accessible alternatives often do not scale in complexity, cost to produce, or both. Motivated by a recent shift to tools for creating visual diagrams from code, we propose a solution that automatically creates accessible representations from structural information about diagrams. Based on a Wizard-of-Oz study, we derive design requirements for an automated system, Arboretum, that compiles text-based diagram specifications into three synchronized nonvisual formats$\\unicode{x2013}$tabular, navigable, and tactile. Our evaluation with BVI users highlights the strength of tactile graphics for complex tasks such as binary search; the benefits of offering multiple, complementary nonvisual representations; and limitations of existing digital navigation patterns for structural reasoning. This work reframes access to data structures by preserving their structural properties. The solution is a practical system to advance accessible CS education.",

This presents opportunities as well as challenges, raising fundamental questions about agency and the role of our bodies when interacting with technology. To advance this research field as a whole, we brought together expert perspectives in a week-long seminar to articulate the grand challenges that should be tackled when it comes to the design of computers' control over our bodies. These grand challenges span technical, design, user, and ethical aspects. By articulating these grand challenges, we aim to begin initiating a research agenda that positions bodily control not only as a technical feature but as a central, experiential, and ethical concern for future human-computer interaction endeavors.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can support design work, but often provide generic, one-off suggestions that limit reflective engagement. We investigate how to guide LLMs to act as design mentors by applying the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model, which emphasizes demonstrating reasoning through six methods: modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration. We operationalize these instructional methods through structured prompting and evaluate them in a within-subjects study with data visualization practitioners. Participants interacted with both a baseline LLM and an instructional LLM designed with cognitive apprenticeship prompts. Surveys, interviews, and conversational log analyses compared experiences across conditions. Our findings show that cognitively informed prompts elicit deeper design reasoning and more reflective feedback exchanges, though the baseline is sometimes preferred depending on task types or experience levels. We distill design considerations for AI-assisted feedback systems that foster reflective practice.",

      "title": "Listening before Asking: Lived-Experience Advisors as Methodological Partners in Dementia Caregiving Studies",
      "content": "arXiv:2601.19021v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Research with dementia caregivers poses persistent methodological and ethical challenges, particularly when interview-based studies are designed without sufficient grounding in lived caregiving realities. Questions framed through clinical or deficit-oriented assumptions risk alienating participants, undermining rapport, and producing shallow or ethically fraught data. While human-computer interaction (HCI) research increasingly adopts participatory approaches in technology design, participation rarely extends to the design of research methods themselves. This paper examines the role of lived-experience advisors as methodological partners in caregiver interview research. We report on a qualitative study in which two advisors with extensive dementia caregiving experience were engaged prior to fieldwork as methodological partners, extending participatory principles beyond technology design into the design of research methods themselves. Drawing on transcripts of advisor consultations and subsequent interviews with ten caregivers and one person living with dementia, we identify two key methodological contributions of advisor involvement. First, advisors enabled anticipatory validity by surfacing caregiving challenges, ethical sensitivities, and interpretive concerns that later appeared in caregiver interviews, allowing the researcher to enter the field with grounded awareness under constrained recruitment and fieldwork conditions. Second, advisors provided cultural, emotional, and systemic context that improved interpretive sensitivity and helped avoid misreadings. We argue that lived experience functions as methodological infrastructure, extending participatory principles into the design and conduct of research itself, and constituting a generalizable methodological pattern for HCI research with caregivers and other vulnerable or marginalized populations.",
