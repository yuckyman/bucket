      "content": "Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach for decoding electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) signals. However, its effectiveness is often limited by the scarcity and variability of available training data. Existing data augmentation methods often introduce signal distortions or lack physiological validity. This study proposes a novel augmentation strategy designed to improve generalization while preserving the underlying neurophysiological structure of EEG...",

COPD imposes a negative and impactful extrapulmonary impairment and commonly overlaps with multimorbidity, particularly cardiovascular disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) aims to improve physical activity (PA) and quality of life, while behavioural change interventions (BCIs) aim to promote lifestyle changes and autonomy. However, after ECOPD, a...",
