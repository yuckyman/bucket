      "title": "Mitochondrial dysfunction precedes neurodegeneration in DRPLA patient-derived neurons, and phenylbutyrate improves survival.",
      "content": "Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a progressive autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATN1 gene, which encodes the transcriptional corepressor Atrophin-1. The temporal sequence of molecular mechanisms driving neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in DRPLA is poorly understood, limiting therapeutic development. We generated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiated them into cortical excitatory glutamatergic neurons to model early pathogenic processes. Early pathological features of DRPLA patient-derived neurons included mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. These alterations occurred before overt neuronal loss, highlighting bioenergetic stress as a key early driver of disease progression toward neurodegeneration. Pharmacological treatment with phenylbutyrate significantly improved neuronal survival and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. These findings challenge the conventional aggregation-centric model of polyglutamine disease pathogenesis and position mitochondrial stress as a central and early promoter of neuronal degeneration in DRPLA. By providing mechanistic insight into early-stage disease processes, our study lays the foundation for therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in DRPLA and related polyglutamine disorders.",

      "content": "Previous studies have found electroencephalogram (EEG) amplitude and scalp topography differences between neurotypical and neurological/neurosurgical groups, being interpreted at the cognitive level. However, these comparisons are invariably accompanied by anatomical changes. Critical to EEG are the so-called volume currents, which are affected by the spatial distribution of the different tissues in the head. We investigated the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled cavities on simulated...",

      "content": "Crossmodal correspondences - systematic mappings between stimulus attributes in different modalities - are ubiquitous in the general population. For example, high-pitched (vs low-pitched) sounds are commonly associated with elevated (vs low) positions in space, and rounded (vs angular) shapes tend to be linked to the term 'Bouba' (vs 'Kiki'). There is still some debate about the role of immediate sensory experience versus conceptual colour understanding in crossmodal correspondences. In...",

      "content": "Visual motion perception declines during natural aging in most animals including humans. Edible berries of blackcurrant (BC) and its extracted anthocyanins (BCAs) have beneficial effects on human eyes. However, the effect of BCAs on the perception of moving objects and other dynamic visual patterns remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether BCAs improve visual movement perception in aging mice. The aging mice were fed either a standard diet or a standard diet containing BC....",

While recent large-scale vision models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) and CLIP offer potential, SAM is trained on natural images, lacking medical domain knowledge, and its decoder struggles with accurate tumor segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose the Medical SAM-Clip Grafting...",

Anemia, which is a widespread condition that affects billions of people worldwide, compromises oxygen transport due to low hemoglobin levels, which leads to severe complications if left undetected. Early and frequent monitoring is essential, yet traditional blood tests can be invasive, costly, and impractical for continuous assessment. This study presents the first...",
