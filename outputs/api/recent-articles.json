      "title": "Build Android apps using Rust and iced",
      "content": "<p>Some time ago I decided to try building an Android app using Rust. After a few weeks I got it working. There was a new iced release recently, so I've just updated the example to new iced and wgpu. I'd like to share my experience to attract more attention to Rust on Android.<p>First things, I want to thank all the people who work on the foundational crates and tools such as:\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rust-mobile/android-activity</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit</a>\n- and many others<p>When I started I had to learn what tools and examples already exist. Luckily, there's a good set of examples using both NativeActivity and GameActivity:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/rust-mobile/rust-android-examples</a><p>The basic approach is that we take android-activity, winit and wgpu and that's it. On top of that you can find a few egui examples in the rust-android-examples repo.<p>Alright, so after I've got the basic examples running, I wanted to combine them with iced. Iced is a crossplatform gui library focusing on desktop and web. The mobile support is explicitly a non-goal, as far as I can tell at the moment of writing. Yet, there's an issue where some people posted their experiments. That's how I knew it was possible:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/302\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/issues/302</a><p>There's a way to integrate iced in wgpu applications, so called integration example:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.14.0/examples/integration\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/tree/0.14.0/examples/integra...</a><p>Above I mentioned that using winit and wgpu in combination with android-activity is enough to build the app. Putting together 1 + 1 I got 2: let's use iced integration example with android-activity. It was quite easy to compile with almost no errors. First issue I encountered is that there was no text rendered. I solved this by loading fonts the way it was shown here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/243#issue-2189977938\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/243#issue-21899...</a><p>Then I patched a few widgets to add touch support. And that's it. My role here was to take all the prior work and combine it together in a way that there's a working example.<p>Some other ways of building Android apps using Rust:\n- xilem has an explicit goal to support mobile <a href=\"https://github.com/linebender/xilem\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/linebender/xilem</a>\n- egui supports mobile <a href=\"https://github.com/emilk/egui\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/emilk/egui</a>\n- game engines such as Fyrox and Bevy support mobile:\n  - <a href=\"https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox</a>\n  - <a href=\"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy</a>\n- pretty much anything built on top of winit and wgpu<p>All of the above is related to building native apps using either NativeActivity or GameActivity. I'm leaving webview out of scope of current post.<p>What about iOS? As far as I know it should be similar or maybe simpler compared to Android. I haven't built it yet, but the next time I have a sizeable amount of free time, I'll try to make it work. The plan is the same: pick winit, wgpu, iced integration example, mix it together until it works. It'll require the same trick to load fonts, and maybe something else, but no visible blockers as of now.<p>Once again, thanks to all the people who made it possible and I wish you have a great time building mobile apps with Rust!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46350641\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46350641</a></p>\n<p>Points: 6</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",

      "title": "A simple robot suggests trunk rotation is essential for emergence of inside leading limb during quadruped galloping turns",
      "content": "During turning maneuvers in the galloping gait of quadruped animals, a strong relationship exists between the turning direction and the sequence in which the forelimbs make ground contact: the outer forelimb acts as the \u201ctrailing limb\u201d while the inner forelimb serves as the \u201cleading limb.\u201d However, the control mechanisms underlying this behavior remain largely unclear. Understanding these mechanisms could deepen biological knowledge and assist in developing more agile robots. To address this issue, we hypothesized that decentralized interlimb coordination mechanism and trunk movement are essential for the emergence of an inside leading limb in a galloping turn. To test the hypothesis, we developed a quasi-quadruped robot with simplified wheeled hind limbs and variable trunk roll and yaw angles. For forelimb coordination, we implemented a simple decentralized control based on local load-dependent sensory feedback, utilizing trunk roll inclination and yaw bending as turning methods. Our experimental results confirmed that in addition to the decentralized control from previous studies which reproduces animal locomotion in a straight line, adjusting the trunk roll angle spontaneously generates a ground contact sequence similar to gallop turning in quadruped animals. Furthermore, roll inclination showed a greater influence than yaw bending on differentiating the leading and trailing limbs. This study suggests that physical interactions serve as a universal mechanism of locomotor control in both forward and turning movements of quadrupedal animals.",
