      "content": "Schizophrenia is associated with profound working memory deficits, for which there are no approved treatments. Rare heterozygous null mutations in SETD1A, a gene encoding a key epigenetic regulatory protein, have been definitively linked to increased risk for schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. To investigate how SETD1A haploinsufficiency impacts the function of circuits supporting working memory, this study examined neural oscillatory synchrony across a network of brain regions critical for spatial working memory (SWM) in mice carrying a loss-of-function allele in the orthologous SETD1A gene. Local field potential recordings were performed in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and thalamic nucleus reuniens in male and female wildtype and Setd1a+/- mice performing a delayed non-match to sample task of SWM. Setd1a+/- mice exhibited unaltered prefrontal-hippocampal neural oscillatory synchrony across frequencies and task epochs. In contrast, Setd1a+/- mice displayed reduced beta-frequency synchrony between the prefrontal cortex and nucleus reuniens during SWM maintenance and blunted bidirectional modulation of prefrontal-reuniens beta- and gamma-frequency synchrony across SWM task epochs. Collectively, this work expands our understanding of how genetic risk for schizophrenia alters functional connectivity within distributed circuits supporting SWM.",

      "title": "Dissociation of Striosome and Matrix Activation in the Human Striatum During the Cue and Execution Phases of Working Memory",
      "content": "The striatum comprises two neurochemically and anatomically distinct tissue compartments, the striosome and matrix, that are hypothesized to support different aspects of cognition and action. In animal studies, the striosome has been linked to reward evaluation, emotional learning, and decision-making under conflict, whereas the matrix is more closely associated with sensorimotor integration and task execution. However, evidence for compartment-specific function in humans is limited and indirect. Using probabilistic tractography, we identified voxels with striosome-like and matrix-like patterns of structural connectivity in healthy adults. We then examined how these compartment-like voxels responded to task demands during an fMRI n-back working-memory paradigm that visually presented four stimulus categories (body part, face, place, or tool). We assessed activation in a low-load condition (0-back, remembering a just-viewed stimulus) vs. a high-load condition (2-back, remembering a stimulus viewed two prior). Functional activation was temporally segregated and matched our prior findings in motor tasks: striosome-like voxels were preferentially engaged during the cue and initial preparation phases, whereas matrix-like voxels dominated during task execution. Trial accuracy strongly modulated striatal activation, with both compartments showing significantly greater responses during \"correct\" than in \"error\" trials. Notably, the accuracy-related increase in activation was larger in striosome-like voxels, consistent with a prominent role for striosomal processing in performance evaluation. Both striosome- and matrix-like voxels significantly increased activation from 0-back to 2-back, indicating sensitivity to working-memory load, with larger increases for matrix-like than for striosome-like voxels. Category-selective responses also differed by compartment and cognitive load. Under low working-memory load (0-back), stimulus-category effects were modest and broadly similar between compartments. Under higher load (2-back), activation in striosome-like voxels remained selective for specific stimulus categories, while matrix-like voxels lost category specificity. Together, these findings suggest that the striosome-matrix distinction generalizes from motor to cognitive domains, reflecting a conserved division between preparatory and execution-related processes that varies systematically with task demands, memory category, and performance accuracy. This convergence of compartment-specific responses across domains points to a core organizational principle of the human striatum with potential implications for neuropsychiatric diseases.",

      "title": "Microstructural Disruption of the Forceps Minor in Schizophrenia: A Potential Clinical Imaging Biomarker Using Translational DTI",
      "content": "Schizophrenia is one of the most complex brain disorders, arising from multidimensional pathophysiological processes that span genetic vulnerability, neurotransmitter dysregulation, structural brain damage, and large-scale brain network dysfunction. Large-scale neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated the critical role of frontal brain regions in schizophrenia. Despite substantial progress, the precise localization of structural damage within these regions and the neurobiological mechanisms linking such alterations to disease pathology remain poorly understood. In this study, we included a total of 115 subjects from two sites of the B-SNIP dataset, comprising 60 healthy controls and 55 individuals with schizophrenia. We employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to precisely characterize specific structural alterations in the frontal brain regions associated with schizophrenia. Our findings reveal significant microstructural abnormalities in the forceps minor, a major commissural white-matter tract that serves as a critical interhemispheric bridge between the bilateral frontal lobes. Network-level mapping further demonstrates that the forceps minor is closely integrated with large-scale brain networks, particularly the default mode network, and maintains strong structural connectivity with orbitofrontal regions-both of which are known to exhibit dysfunction in schizophrenia. Moreover, converging evidence suggests that the forceps minor plays an important role in the regulation of social behavior, a core domain of impairment in schizophrenia. Collectively, these findings identify the forceps minor as a promising structural imaging biomarker for schizophrenia and provide novel insights into the microstructural mechanisms underlying the disorder.",

      "content": "Creativity is one of the unique cognitive constructs in human beings and its neurobiological correlates are one of the current hot topics in neuroscience. The Different Hearing program (DHP) is an educational activity aimed at stimulating musical creativity by means of group composing in the classroom, alternative to the mainstream model of music education in Czechia. In our previous study, the data from task-related functional MRI with passive listening was analyzed. The results suggested that DHP training modified the response to diverse sound samples, differentially changing the engagement of functional networks known to be related to creative thinking, namely, increasing default mode network activation and decreasing activation of executive and salience networks. In the present study, we hypothesized that the DHP short-term (2 days) intense workshop would also induce changes in the resting-state networks that were significantly modified during task. To investigate it, seed-based, ROI-to-ROI resting-state functional connectivity and degree centrality analysis were performed on the acquired resting-state fMRI data. The results showed no significant group-by-time interaction.",

      "title": "Potential of EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation to improve source analysis in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy",
      "content": "Objective. Conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields is a promising method to reduce the uncertainty of electroencephalography (EEG) and combined EEG/magnetoencephalography (MEG) source analysis due to inter-individual variations of tissue conductivities. Approaches for skull conductivity estimation based on evoked potentials and fields have been proposed in several studies, but the current knowledge about their sensitivity towards uncertainties of other tissue conductivities and the effects on source analysis accuracy is insufficient. In this study, we analyze this sensitivity for EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation and to what extent skull conductivity estimation improves the EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Approach. We simulated EEG and MEG measurements of evoked brain activity and IEDs for randomly assigned tissue conductivities and performed EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation for the simulated measurements. Following, we performed EEG, MEG, and combined EEG/MEG source analysis of the simulated IEDs and compared the results with and without using the individually estimated skull conductivities. Main results. We find that EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation is more accurate than EEG skull conductivity estimation, especially when considering realistic noise levels, whereas the type of the evoked brain activity only had a minor influence on the accuracy of the conductivity estimation. Both EEG and EEG/MEG skull conductivity estimation clearly improve source analysis accuracy for EEG and combined EEG/MEG source analysis, reducing the uncertainty of the source localization from a few centimeters to less than one centimeter for most sources. However, we find that the effect of the conductivity estimation is less pronounced for sources at the base of the brain. Significance. EEG and EEG/MEG conductivity estimation exploiting evoked potentials and fields has the potential to become a valuable tool to reduce uncertainty in source analysis of IEDs, while it only requires little additional measurement effort.",
