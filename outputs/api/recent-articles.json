      "title": "Loss of Nuclear TDP-43 Impairs Lipid Metabolism in Microglia-Like Cells",
      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease marked by progressive motor neuron loss, with TDP-43 pathology present in over 90% of cases. While neuroinflammation is a recognized hallmark, the role of microglia in ALS pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 regulates microglial function via triglyceride metabolism. Using shRNA-mediated TARDBP knockdown in human monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (MDMi), we observed suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis, upregulation of fatty acid metabolism genes, lipid droplet accumulation, enhanced phagocytic activity, and increased IL-1{beta} production. Inhibiting diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes reduced lipid droplet formation, phagocytosis, and IL-1{beta}, directly linking the triglyceride pathway to microglial activation. Patient-derived MDMi from both sporadic and TARDBP-mutant ALS cases showed overlapping as well as distinct alterations, some of which were reversed by DGAT inhibition. Our findings identify dysregulated triglyceride metabolism as a novel pathway through which TDP-43 mediates microglial dysfunction, highlighting a potential therapeutic target for ALS.",

      "title": "Proteomic and Kinetic Characterization of Prion Seeding in Distinct Human CJD Strains Unveils Early Diagnostic Biomarkers",
      "content": "To enhance understanding of early diagnosis, disease progression, and molecular signatures of human prion strains, we analyzed prion seeding activity in Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) infected mice using the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay. Infectious prion strains derived from CJD-MM1 and VV2 human brain tissues were inoculated into tg340, tg361 (expressing ~4x human PrP-M129 or PrP-V129), and tg650 (expressing ~6x human PrP-M129) mice. We examined 188 brain samples from confirmed CJD-infected and control mice at pre-clinical and clinical stages. Region- and strain-specific differences in seeding activity emerged at pre-clinical stages. Lag phases ranged from 7.5 - 24.5 h across regions and stages: MM1-infected tg340 cortex displayed prolonged lag (~24.5 h), while VV2-infected tg341 cortex showed minimal seeding. In contrast, VV2 cerebellum exhibited shorter lag phases at clinical stage but significantly reduced fluorescence signals at pre-clinical stage. Proteomic profiling (SWATH-MS) revealed 500 and 682 differentially expressed proteins in MM1 and VV2 models, respectively. Early pre-clinical alterations included Gnl1, Stxbp1, Pllp, Nefh, Ahsa1, Rala, and Atp2b2 in MM1, and Tnc, Calb2, Dnaja1, Hpcal1, Prkca, and Syn2 in VV2, correlating with detectable prion replication. Functional analyses suggested distinct compensatory responses: MM1 involved metabolic reprogramming and vesicle clearance, while VV2 showed early calcium signaling disturbances and structural impairment. These findings demonstrate that RT-QuIC combined with proteomics enables sensitive detection of strain-specific pre-clinical changes, providing mechanistic insights into prion pathogenesis and identifying potential biomarkers for early diagnosis. Key words: Prion diseases, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), RT-QuIC, molecular profiling, prion seeding activity, biomarkers, SWATH-MS, disease progression.",

      "title": "REM sleep prefrontal ripple chains mediate distinct cortical-hippocampal reactivation patterns compared to NREM ripples",
      "content": "REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) sleep stages are both critical for systems memory consolidation in hippocampal-cortical circuits. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying REM memory processes remain relatively unclear compared to NREM memory reactivation. Here we report, in rodents, the existence of prefrontal cortical (PFC) high-frequency ripple chains in REM sleep during consolidation of recently acquired spatial memory. High-density tetrode recordings in hippocampal area CA1 and PFC reveal that, in contrast to NREM cortical ripples, REM cortical ripples occur in characteristic chains that are phase modulated by theta oscillations in phasic REM sleep, corresponding to increased CA1-PFC theta coherence and delineating periods of enhanced hippocampal-cortical communication. REM ripple chains sequentially organize sparse PFC ensemble reactivation of behavioral activity during periods of local suppression, distinct from widespread reactivation bursts during NREM ripples. REM ripple chains also selectively engage CA1 neuronal populations that shift preferred theta-phase from behavior to REM sleep. Co-reactivation of PFC and CA1 neurons during REM ripple chains was linked to CA1 activity suppression during NREM PFC ripples, and to differential changes in CA1 neuronal firing rates in sleep, suggesting REM-driven regulation of hippocampal excitability. A cortical network model incorporating the effects of acetylcholine can reproduce the distinct REM and NREM activity patterns, providing a mechanistic basis for widespread coactivity during NREM cortical ripples, compared to sparse, temporally extended reactivation on a background of local suppression during REM ripple chains. Overall, these findings establish a role for PFC ripples in regulating distinct dual sleep stage cortical-hippocampal reactivation patterns.",

      "title": "Social observation influences the trajectory of performance monitoring across trials: evidence from single-trial estimates of the ERN and CRN",
      "content": "The error-related negativity (ERN) and correct-related negativity (CRN) are event-related potentials (ERPs) that reflect performance monitoring following error and correct responses, respectively. Prior work demonstrates the ERN is sensitive to the motivational significance of errors, which increases under social observation. However, most studies testing how social observation impacts performance monitoring rely on trial-averaged ERPs, potentially obscuring meaningful fluctuations in ERN/CRN over time. Here, we had participants complete a Flanker task twice (social observation vs. alone) and employed mixed-effects modeling of single-trial ERPs to test if social observation impacts ERN/CRN trajectories over short (within blocks) or long (between blocks) timescales. We found that social observation selectively influenced ERN/CRN trajectories over short timescales: for blocks performed under social observation (but not alone), ERN magnitudes increased across trials and CRN magnitudes decreased. At longer timescales, ERN/CRN significantly decreased across all blocks, regardless of social observation and consistent with a vigilance decrement. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that social observation influences performance monitoring trajectories over short timescales. Results highlight the importance of analyzing ERN/CRN trajectories over relatively short timescales to fully characterize the impact of social observation on performance monitoring dynamics. These findings lay the groundwork for future investigation into whether social observation interacts with individual differences in motivation/affect to differentially impact performance monitoring dynamics.",

      "content": "We evaluated the cognitive and academic effects of a closed-loop video game delivered in virtual reality (VR) and tablet formats, at two different dosages, in a school-based setting. A total of 158 children aged 8-9 with a range of attention abilities completed 30 training sessions over 10 weeks. Compared to an expectancy-matched control group, both VR and tablet training led to significant improvements in teacher-rated inattention, performance-based attention tasks, and eye-tracking measures. While both VR and tablet versions of the intervention showed benefits on specific attention-related and academic outcomes, the VR version showed select advantages in both regards. Notably, intervention dose did not significantly moderate outcomes, suggesting that efficacy may depend more on reaching a threshold of engagement than on total duration. These findings demonstrate the utility and benefits of using each type of technology to enhance measures of cognitive and academic abilities as part of a regular school curriculum.",

      "title": "Patch-Clamp Single-Cell Proteomics in Acute Brain Slices: A Framework for Recording, Retrieval, and Interpretation",
      "content": "Single-cell proteomics (SCP) is a powerful method for interrogating the molecular composition of neurons, yet its application to acute brain slices has remained limited. Patch-clamp electrophysiology provides direct information on neuronal excitability, synaptic inputs, and ion channel function, making it a natural partner for SCP. However, combining these techniques introduces unique challenges: neurons must be both physiologically characterized and physically collected, and variability during retrieval from the brain slice can affect how faithfully proteomic measurements reflect in situ physiology. Here, we introduce a framework for interpreting patch-SCP outcomes that considers retrieval quality in terms of both the amount of material collected and the synaptic contents being recovered. Using a shotgun strategy in which all patched neurons were collected regardless of electrophysiological outcome, we systematically benchmarked the retrieval of pyramidal neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex. Capacitance measured during gigaseal-preserved retrieval correlated with protein identifications, providing a proxy for linking soma size to proteome yield. Preservation of neuronal spiking during relocation was associated with broader synaptic enrichment and recovery of transmembrane proteins. By comparison, torn or aspirated neurons produced small proteomes with poor synaptic representation and neurons with lost gigaseals or no recordings displayed variable outcomes that could still yield substantial molecular information. Together, these results establish shotgun patch-SCP as both proof-of-concept and a practical framework for linking neuronal physiology with proteomics in semi-intact circuits.",

      "title": "Effects of TMS on the decoding, electrophysiology, and representational geometry of priority in working memory",
      "content": "The flexible control of working memory (WM) requires prioritizing immediately task-relevant information while maintaining information with potential future relevance in a deprioritized state. Using double-serial retrocuing (DSR) with simultaneous EEG recording, we investigated how single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) to right intraparietal sulcus impacts neural representations of unprioritized memory items (UMI), relative to irrelevant memory items (IMI) that are no longer needed for the trial. Twelve human participants (8 female) performed DSR plus a single-retrocue task, while spTMS was delivered during delay periods. Multivariate pattern analysis revealed that spTMS restored decodability of the UMI concurrent with stimulation, and that of the IMI several timesteps later, after the evoked effects of spTMS were no longer present in the EEG signal. This effect was carried by the alpha and low-beta frequency bands. Analyses of the EEG showed two effects selective to the UMI: both the retrocue designating the UMI and spTMS produced phase shifts in the low-beta band. These results were mirrored by representational geometry analyses, which revealed larger cue-related and spTMS-related rotations of the UMI-representing subspace, compared to the prioritized subspace spTMS. These findings demonstrate that deprioritization involves active neural mechanisms distinct from the processing of the IMI, and that these are supported by low-beta oscillatory dynamics in parietal cortex. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying spTMS-triggered involuntary retrieval of the UMI is the disruption of the encoding of priority status, which may depend on oscillatory dynamics in the low-beta band.",

      "title": "Fusogen-induced recovery of spinal cord function andmorphology after complete transection",
      "content": "Background: Spinal cord injury is a critical issue in neurosurgery, lacking established clinical methods for functional restoration. This study reports the effects of a fusogen sealant, composed of polyethylene glycol and chitosan, in an experimental model of complete spinal cord transection in pigs. Objective: To evaluate the functional and morphological recovery of the spinal cord in an animal model of complete transection following treatment with a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate.Materials and methods: Hungarian Mangalica pigs (m = 20.0 {+/-} 2.0 kg, N = 5) underwent complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord, followed by an extended laminectomy and transpedicular fixation. In the experimental group (N = 3), a synthesized gel based on a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate was applied to the spinal gap; the other group (N = 2) served as a control. The postoperative period lasted 60 days and included multi-component rehabilitation. Clinical-functional status was assessed using established neurological scales. In vivo retrograde tracing of the spinal cord was performed using hydroxystilbamidine (FluoroGold). Following the experiment, immunofluorescent histology was conducted using primary antibodies to neurofilament (NF-200), a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody, and the nuclear dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The resulting morphology was examined via fluorescence and light microscopy. Results: Control animals maintained lower paraplegia, anesthesia, and pelvic dysfunction throughout the experiment. In contrast, the experimental group showed positive changes, including the return of sensation from day two. By the end of the study, all animals in this group could assume an upright posture and ambulate on all limbs. These outcomes were statistically significant. Microscopy revealed axons traversing the injury site in the experimental group, whereas control samples showed degenerative post-traumatic changes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a fusogen sealant based on a polyethylene glycol-chitosan conjugate promotes significant morphofunctional recovery after complete spinal cord transection, supporting its therapeutic potential.

How does perceptual and conceptual information unfold in the brain when we observe what others are doing? We collected EEG and fMRI data while participants viewed short videos and sentences depicting naturalistic actions. Using representational similarity analysis, we found a posterior-to-anterior gradient along the lateral pathway, from perceptual features to conceptual, modality-invariant representations. Among conceptual features, the target of actions (i.e. whether the action was directed at an object, a person, or the self) explained the most unique variance in EEG responses. In fMRI, we found distinct conceptual representations along the ventral, dorsal, and lateral pathways, with the target of actions specifically encoded in lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Finally, EEG-fMRI fusion revealed rapid processing along the lateral and dorsal pathways. Together, our results disentangle the perceptual and conceptual components of action understanding and characterize the underlying spatiotemporal dynamics in the human brain.",

      "title": "VAE deep learning model with domain adaptation, transfer learning and harmonization for diagnostic classification from multi-site neuroimaging data",
      "content": "In large public multi-site fMRI datasets, the sample characteristics, data acquisition methods, and MRI scanner models vary across sites and datasets. This non-neural variability obscures neural differences between groups and leads to poor machine learning based diagnostic classification of neurodevelopmental conditions. This could be potentially addressed by domain adaptation, which aims to improve classification performance in a given target domain by utilizing the knowledge learned from a different source domain by making data distributions of the two domains as similar as possible. In order to demonstrate the utility of domain adaptation for multi-site fMRI data, this research developed a variational autoencoder\u2014maximum mean discrepancy (VAE-MMD) deep learning model for three-way diagnostic classification: (i) Autism, (ii) Asperger's syndrome, and (iii) typically developing controls. This study chooses ABIDE-II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset as the target domain and ABIDE-I as the source domain. The results show that domain adaptation from ABIDE-I to ABIDE-II provides superior test accuracy of ABIDE-II compared to just using ABIDE-II for classification. Further, augmenting the source domain with additional healthy control subjects from Healthy Brain Network (HBN) and Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) datasets enables transfer learning and improves ABIDE-II classification performance. Finally, a comparison with statistical data harmonization techniques, such as ComBat, reveals that domain adaptation using VAE-MMD achieves comparable performance, and incorporating transfer learning (TL) with additional healthy control data substantially improves classification accuracy beyond that achieved by statistical methods (such as ComBat) alone. The dataset and the model used in this study are publicly available. The neuroimaging community can explore the possibility of further improving the model by utilizing the ever-increasing amount of healthy control fMRI data in the public domain.",

      "title": "Combined long nerve allograft and nerve transfer for functional recovery of ulnar nerve: case study with longitudinal clinical and neurodiagnostic follow-up",
      "content": "BackgroundPeripheral nerve injuries involving large gaps (>50 mm) are associated with poor outcomes due to delayed axonal regeneration and limited reconstructive options. While autografts are traditionally the gold standard, their use is limited by donor site morbidity and length constraints. Processed nerve allografts have emerged as an alternative, but data on their long-term efficacy, particularly for gaps \u226560 mm remain limited.Case reportWe present a case of a 15-year-old male with a 68-mm ulnar nerve gap following trauma reconstructed acutely with a processed nerve allograft. This procedure was performed in conjunction with an anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) to ulnar motor branch transfer and ulnar nerve decompression of potential entrapment sites.ResultsSerial assessments over 4.5 years demonstrated substantial recovery. By 16 months, the patient had regained strong grip strength, full range of motion, and near-normal sensory thresholds. At final follow-up, he had returned to all activities without limitations. Serial EMGs confirmed early nascent motor unit recruitment by 3 months, progressive reinnervation at 16 months, and persistent low-amplitude responses at 54 months, suggestive of ongoing but incomplete reinnervation.ConclusionThis case provides the longest known electrodiagnostic follow-up of a long-gap ulnar nerve allograft reconstruction. It supports the feasibility of processed allografts for gaps \u226470 mm and emphasizes the value of long-term EMG monitoring in tracking regeneration. These findings contribute critical data to a sparsely studied domain and help define expectations for complex nerve repairs.",

      "title": "Frontal-subcortical dysfunction in toxic oil syndrome: a proof-of-concept eye-tracking and cognitive study four decades after exposure",
      "content": "IntroductionToxic Oil Syndrome (TOS) emerged in Spain in 1981 after ingestion of rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline derivatives. More than four decades later, survivors continue to report cognitive complaints, but objective evidence of long-term dysfunction remains limited.MethodsIn this case-control study, 47 TOS survivors and 44 matched healthy controls completed validated eye-tracking paradigms (visually guided, memory-guided, and antisaccade tasks) and a standardized neuropsychological battery. Groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, or education.ResultsTOS survivors showed preserved performance on visually guided and memory-guided saccades, with no group differences in latency, gain, peak velocity, or spatial error (all p\u202f>\u202f0.05). In contrast, they exhibited fewer correct antisaccades (mean 3.6 vs. 5.0; p = 0.029), more reflexive saccades (mean 7.0 vs. 5.7; p = 0.033), and increased backward reflexive saccades (mean 6.3 vs. 5.1; p = 0.040). Cognitive testing revealed selective impairments in executive function, attention, and processing speed, with preserved memory. Structural equation modeling confirmed that antisaccade impairment remained significant after adjusting for confounders and demonstrated an independent contribution of attention to correct antisaccade performance.ConclusionFindings indicate persistent frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction in TOS survivors, consistent with immune- or vascular-mediated injury patterns rather than progressive neurodegeneration. Eye-tracking provides a noninvasive biomarker of latent executive dysfunction and may be useful for long-term monitoring of populations exposed to environmental toxins.",

      "title": "The speech reception threshold can be estimated using EEG electrodes in and around the ear",
      "content": "Objective. Previous studies have demonstrated that the speech reception threshold (SRT) can be estimated using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), referred to as SRTneuro. The present study assesses the feasibility of using ear-EEG, which allows for discreet measurement of neural activity from in and around the ear, to estimate the SRTneuro. Approach. Twenty young normal-hearing participants listened to audiobook excerpts at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) whilst wearing a 66-channel EEG cap and 12 ear-EEG electrodes. A linear decoder was trained on different electrode configurations to estimate the envelope of the audio excerpts from the EEG recordings. The reconstruction accuracy was determined by calculating the Pearson\u2019s correlation between the actual and the estimated envelope. A sigmoid function was then fitted to the reconstruction-accuracy-vs-SNR data points, with the midpoint of the sigmoid serving as the SRTneuro estimate for each participant. Main results. Using only in-ear electrodes, the estimated SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the behaviorally measured SRT (SRTbeh) for 6 out of 20 participants (30%). With electrodes placed both in and around the ear, the SRTneuro was within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants (95%) and thus on par with the reference estimate obtained from full-scalp EEG. Using only electrodes in and around the ear from the right side of the head, the SRTneuro remained within 3 dB of the SRTbeh for 19 out of 20 participants. Significance. These findings suggest that the SRTneuro can be reliably estimated using ear-EEG, especially when combining in-ear electrodes and around-the-ear electrodes. Such an estimate can be highly useful e.g. for continuously adjusting noise-reduction algorithms in hearing aids or for logging the SRT in the user\u2019s natural environment.",
