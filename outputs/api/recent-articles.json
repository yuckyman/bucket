      "title": "A Dead-Simple Reservation Web App Framework Abusing Mkdocs",
      "content": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted a reservation system web app for my apartment building's amenities, but the available open source solutions were too complicated, so <a href=\"https://github.com/joshhubert-dsp/reserve-it\">I built my own</a>. Ended up turning it into a lightweight framework, implemented as a mkdocs plugin to abuse mkdocs/material as a frontend build tool. So you get the full aesthetic customization capababilities those provide. I call it... <strong>Reserve-It!</strong></p> <p>It just requires a dedicated Google account for the app, since it uses Google Calendar for persistent calendar stores.</p> <ul> <li>You make a calendar for each independently reservable resource (like say a single tennis court) and bundle multiple interchangeable resources (multiple tennis courts) into one form page interface.</li> <li>Users' confirmation emails are really just Gcal events the app account invites them to. Users can opt to receive event reminders, which are just Gcal event updates in a trenchcoat triggered N minutes before.</li> <li>Users don't need accounts, just an email address. A minimal sqlite database stores addresses that have made reservations, and each one can only hold one reservation at a time. Users can cancel their events and reschedule.</li> <li>You can add additional custom form inputs for a shared password you disseminate on community communication channels, or any additional validation your heart desires. Custom validation just requires subclassing a provided pydantic model.</li> </ul> <p>You define reservable resources in a directory full of yaml files like this:</p> <pre><code># resource page title name: Tennis Courts # displayed along with title emoji: \ud83c\udfbe # resource page subtitle description: Love is nothing. # the google calendar ids for each individual tennis court, and their hex colors for the # embedded calendar view. calendars: CourtA: id: longhexstring1@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#AA0000&quot; CourtB: id: longhexstring2@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#00AA00&quot; CourtC: id: longhexstring3@group.calendar.google.com color: &quot;#0000AA&quot; day_start_time: 8:00 AM day_end_time: 8:00 PM # the granularity of available reservations, here it's every hour from 8 to 8. minutes_increment: 60 # the maximum allowed reservation length maximum_minutes: 180 # users can choose whether to receive an email reminder minutes_before_reminder: 60 # how far in advance users are allowed to make reservations maximum_days_ahead: 14 # users can indicate whether they're willing to share a resource with others, adds a # checkbox to the form if true allow_shareable: true # Optionally, add additional custom form fields to this resource reservation webpage, on # top of the ones defined in app-config.yaml custom_form_fields: - type: number name: ntrp label: NTRP Rating required: True # Optionally, specify a path to a descriptive image for this resource, displayed on the # form webpage. Must be a path relative to resource-configs dir. image: path: courts.jpg caption: court map pixel_width: 800 </code></pre> <p>Each one maps to a form webpage built for that resource, which looks like <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshhubert-dsp/reserve-it/refs/heads/main/form-page.png\">this</a>.</p> <p>I'm gonna go ahead and call myself a bootleg full stack developer now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mediocre_Musician889\"> /u/Mediocre_Musician889 </a> <br /> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcfa2a/a_deadsimple_reservation_web_app_framework/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qcfa2a/a_deadsimple_reservation_web_app_framework/\">[comments]</a></span>",

      "title": "Cross-brain transfer of high-performance intracortical speech and handwriting BCIs",
      "content": "Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that decode complex movements, such as handwriting and speech, can require substantial training data to achieve high performance. We investigated whether leveraging the neural activity recordings of previous users could reduce this initial data collection burden for new BCI users (an approach we call \"cross-brain transfer\"). Using intracortical recordings from five BrainGate2 clinical trial participants, we tested cross-brain transfer for both speech and handwriting neural decoders trained and evaluated on general, unconstrained corpora of spoken and written English. We found that cross-brain transfer improved decoding performance when training data from the target user was limited (< 200 sentences), and that dataset-specific input layers to the decoder were critical for combining data across users. Without trainable input layers, transfer failed and performed worse than training from scratch on target user data only. Finally, we measured the effectiveness of cross-brain transfer relative to training with (1) more data from the same user and (2) more electrode-permuted data from the same user, which simulates sampling from another brain with identical neural latent structure. In some cases (T16 speech, T12 handwriting), cross-brain transfer appeared as effective as additional permuted data from the same user, while in others (T12 speech, T15 speech) electrode-permuted data was more beneficial. Our results successfully demonstrate and characterize cross-brain transfer learning between multiple intracortical BCI users, for both speech and handwriting, using a general open-ended dataset not restricted to small sets of words or phrases. This work highlights a promising path towards addressing a key barrier to the clinical translation of BCIs, while clarifying when cross-brain transfer may be most beneficial and the decoder design choices needed to realize those gains.",
