      "title": "A neural network model combining the successor representation and actor-critic methods reveals effective biological use of the representation",
      "content": "In learning goal-directed behavior, state representation is important for adapting to the environment and achieving goals. A predictive state representation called successive representation (SR) has recently attracted attention as a candidate for state representation in animal brains, especially in the hippocampus. The relationship between the SR and the animal brain has been studied, and several neural network models for computing the SR have been proposed based on the findings. However, studies on implementation of the SR involving action selection have not yet advanced significantly. Therefore, we explore possible mechanisms by which the SR is utilized biologically for action selection and learning optimal action policies. The actor-critic architecture is a promising model of animal behavioral learning in terms of its correspondence to the anatomy and function of the basal ganglia, so it is suitable for our purpose. In this study, we construct neural network models for behavioral learning using the SR. By using them to perform reinforcement learning, we investigate their properties. Specifically, we investigated the effect of using different state representations for the actor and critic in the actor-critic method, and also compared the actor-critic method with Q-learning and SARSA. We found the difference between the effect of using the SR for the actor and the effect of using the SR for the critic in the actor-critic method, and observed that using the SR in conjunction with one-hot encoding makes it possible to learn with the benefits of both representations. These results suggest the possibility that the striatum can learn using multiple state representations complementarily.",

      "title": "Neural correlates of implicit memory for reoccurring sound patterns",
      "content": "The human brain exhibits remarkable sensitivity to auditory patterns. Previous research has shown that beyond the detection of such patterns, humans form memories for them that are implicit, robust to interference, and persistent over time. Here, we examine the mechanisms underlying implicit memory formation for reoccurring regular tone patterns using UHF fMRI. Prior to scanning, implicit memory was induced through a standard behavioral task where participants detected regular patterns embedded in random tone sequences. Unbeknownst to participants, five regular patterns reoccurred sporadically (every 1.5 min) across trials. Consistent with previous reports, behavioral performance indicated a reaction time advantage to reoccurring patterns, confirming the formation of implicit memory traces. During passive listening in the scanner, regularity engaged the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, insula, putamen, and hippocampus, a result we interpret as reflecting the higher perceptual precision of regular patterns. Reoccurrence interacted with regularity in the superior temporal gyrus and a frontal cluster, showing higher activity for reoccurring compared to novel regular patterns. The hippocampus showed sensitivity to reoccurrence in both regular and random patterns. Together, these results indicate that the neocortex may selectively amplify reoccurring inputs in line with their enhanced (memory driven) perceptual precision.",

      "content": "Robustness, defined as a system's ability to maintain functional reliability in the face of perturbations, is achieved through its capacity to filter external disturbances using internal priors encoded in its structure and states. While biophysical neural networks are widely recognized for their robustness, the precise mechanisms underlying this resilience remain poorly understood. In this study, we explore how orientation-selective neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring network respond to perturbations, with the aim of uncovering insights into the robustness of visual subsystems in the brain. By analyzing the steady-state dynamics of a rate-based network, we characterize how the activation state of neurons influences the network's response to disturbances. Our results demonstrate that the activation state of neurons, rather than their firing rates alone, governs the network's sensitivity to perturbations. We further show that lateral connectivity modulates this effect by shaping the response profile across spatial frequency components. These findings suggest a state-dependent filtering mechanism that contributes to the robustness of visual circuits, offering theoretical insight into how different components of perturbations are selectively modulated within the network.",

      "title": "Capturing coordination and intentionality in joint musical improvisation.",
      "content": "Humans collaborate with each other on a wide variety of tasks that are often largely improvised and unscripted. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of coordination in a joint musical improvisation task, what the effect of intentions is on coordination, and how musicians propagate these intentions. To quantify coordination within musical trios, we derived per-musician time series of acoustic features to which we applied effective transfer entropy (ETE) and empirical dynamic modeling (EDM), two methods derived from complex systems science. Using ETE allowed us to investigate coordination as directional information flow between musicians, whereas through EDM we conceptualized coordination as the predictability of a complex system. We found that both techniques, when applied to root-mean-square (RMS) amplitude time series, could be used to distinguish coordinating from noncoordinating musicians. Various other feature\u2013technique combinations, such as fractal dimension\u2013ETE and Tonnetz distance\u2013EDM, were also viable. Our results further suggest that coordination improves as an intention gets more shared, that is, as more musicians in the joint improvisation have the same intention. Lastly, we found evidence suggesting that musicians increase the predictability of their playing when seeking to end a performance, though our results did not provide an indication that this was done with the intention of improving coordination with partners.

      "content": "Background: Structure-function coupling quantifies how strongly structural connectivity supports functional communication across brain regions. Investigating structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder, a condition marked by dysconnectivity, may elucidate underlying neural mechanisms. We examined regional structure-function coupling in bipolar disorder and its genetic underpinnings to characterize network-level disruptions. Methods: Regional structure-function coupling was estimated in UK Biobank participants using edge-wise regression between measures of structural connectivity and functional connectivity. Bipolar disorder (n=163) and controls (n=326) were age and sex-matched and compared using general linear models. To explore the genetic basis of these structure-function coupling alterations, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted in an independent UK Biobank sample (n=38,190) for regions showing significant group differences. Results: Structure-function coupling demonstrated a unimodal-to-transmodal gradient with highest coupling evident in visual regions (R^2=0.29) and lowest in the insula (R^2=0.03). The Bipolar disorder group showed higher structure-function coupling in the temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus (beta=0.269; beta=0.211) and lower coupling in the supramarginal, precentral, and postcentral gyri and the frontal pole (beta=-0.206 to -0.275). GWAS identified seven significant loci, with mapped genes (e.g., KAT6B, INPP5A, PLCE1) involved in neuronal development and cellular signaling. Conclusion: Bipolar disorder showed altered structure-function coupling across regions implicating multiple networks. These alterations suggest stronger structure-function alignment in limbic and attention networks and weaker alignment in sensorimotor, executive, frontoparietal, and salience regions relative to controls, potentially disrupting flexible polysynaptic communication. Altered coupling may relate to genetic variation affecting neurodevelopment, neuronal signaling, and synaptic plasticity. Together, these findings offer novel insight into the architectural contributions to the pathophysiology underlying bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow enables axon and dendrite development and maintenance",
      "content": "Distinct microtubule arrays form in axons and dendrites defining their functions in neurons. These arrays are thought to develop through separate processes. Here we challenge this view by showing that axons and dendrites develop by a unifying process: slowdown of microtubule retrograde flow (MT-RF), a recently discovered mechanism of microtubule dynamics. By integrating quantitative data of microtubule dynamics and distributions into a newly developed biophysical model of microtubules across developmental stages, we uncover that MT-RF interacts with microtubule stability and nucleation. Without MT-RF slowdown, this interaction suppresses development and maintenance of axonal and dendritic microtubule arrays. In axons, MT-RF slowdown enables microtubules to reach the tip, even at long distances, supporting axon growth. In dendrites, late MT-RF slowdown facilitates an efficient increase in stable microtubules. Thus, our data-integrated model reveals MT-RF slowdown as central for the development of distinct neuronal compartments, providing a unifying mechanism for microtubule-related physiology.",

      "title": "Glucodynamic Network Transitions of the Human Brain",
      "content": "Variability in neuronal firing patterns enables the brain to flexibly transition between network states, a hallmark of adaptive information processing. Yet the energetic basis of this flexibility remains unknown. Here, we report that the capacity of the brain to shift between network states is contingent on the moment-to-moment variability of glucose metabolism. Using simultaneous resting-state functional FDG-PET and BOLD fMRI in 78 healthy adults (20 to 86 years), we quantified brain metabolic and haemodynamic variability, complexity, and dynamic network connectivity. Individuals with greater variability and complexity of glucose metabolism demonstrated a broader repertoire of network states, marked by globally connected and influential central hubs. Individuals who achieved a broader range of network states had better cognitive performance. In older adults, widespread reductions in dynamic metabolic connectivity were observed. Glucodynamic parameters predicted age and cognitive performance more robustly than haemodynamic measures. These findings reveal that functional network dynamics are emergent properties of the brain's metabolic architecture and that the organisation of large-scale neural circuits is constrained by energetic principles. This understanding may provide critical new insights into the metabolic basis of brain ageing, neurodegeneration and psychiatric conditions.",

      "title": "A Multimodal Framework for Understanding Perceptual Segmentation of Natural Scenes In Autism",
      "content": "Understanding how individuals segment complex natural scenes into perceptual segments is essential for explaining both typical and atypical sensory processing. In Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), differences in visual segmentation and integration are widely documented. However, existing paradigms often rely on simplified stimuli and do not capture the dynamic, naturalistic processes underlying real world scene segmentation. To overcome those limitations, in this work we present a novel, multimodal experimental framework. The framework combines precisely timed, trial-based perceptual measurements with electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how neural activity aligns temporally with segmentation decisions and with eye-tracking to examine visual exploration strategies and attention allocation. Neurotypical (NT) participants and participants with ASD aged 16 years and above viewed natural scenes and textures and indicated whether two cued image regions belonged to the same or different perceptual segments. Responses to multiple pairs of cues enabled the estimation of subjectively perceived segmentation maps and the associated uncertainty. Across NT and ASD populations, we analyzed segmentation maps, reaction time distributions, gaze profiles, and trial-aligned neural responses. Behavioral results revealed slower and more idiosyncratic segmentation patterns in ASD. Eye-tracking analyses also demonstrated distinct gaze patterns suggesting broader exploration of the images during early viewing. EEG analyses demonstrated delayed & more diffuse occipital activation in ASD, accompanied by reduced global field power at several key time windows spanning stimulus presentation. Together, these findings establish a reproducible method for studying the temporal and spatial components of natural scene segmentation and indicate meaningful behavioral and neural distinctions in ASD. This framework provides a methodological bridge between controlled experimental stimuli and real-world perception in both neurotypical and neurodivergent populations.",

      "content": "This Perspective article discusses the emerging potential of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) as a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique for enhancing self-regulatory processes, particularly emotion and sleep regulation, in healthy individuals. Offering high spatial precision and the ability to target both cortical and deep brain regions, TUS uses focused ultrasound waves to induce acute and delayed effects on brain activity. We propose that combining TUS with neurofeedback methods and/or specific cognitive training exercises may capitalise on these neuroplastic effects, thereby augmenting and prolonging their impact to support lasting improvements in self-regulation. We focus on the domains of sleep and emotion regulation, where such an integrated approach may strengthen resilience and promote healthier functioning in the general population. Our aim is to highlight the potential of TUS-based integrated interventions for supporting mental health and well-being in non-clinical populations and to outline key directions for future research.",
