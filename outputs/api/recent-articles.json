These methods make it possible to decode what an individual is perceiving or holding in working memory on the basis of the pattern of BOLD activity across voxels. Remarkably, these methods can also be applied to ERP data, using the pattern of voltage across electrode sites rather than the pattern of activity across voxels to decode the information being represented by the brain (<a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/blog/2018/9/16/decoding\">see this previous blog post</a>). For example, ERPs can be used to decode the identity of a face that is being perceived, the emotional valence of a scene, the identity and semantic category of a word, and the features of an object that is being maintained in working memory. Moreover, decoding methods can be more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting conventional ERP effects (e.g., whether a word is semantically related or unrelated to a previous word in an N400 paradigm).</p><p class=\"\">So far, these methods have mainly been used by a small set of experts. We aim to change that with the upcoming Version 10 of <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/erplab\">ERPLAB Toolbox</a>. This version of ERPLAB will contain an ERP decoding tool that makes it trivially easy for anyone who knows how to do conventional ERP processing to take advantage of the power of decoding. It should be available in mid-July at <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/releases\">our GitHub site</a>. You can join the <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab/wiki/ERPLAB-email-list\">ERPLAB email list</a> to receive an announcement when this version is released. Please do not contact us with questions until it has been released and you have tried using it.</p><p class=\"\">On July 25, 2023, we will hold a 2-hour Zoom webinar to explain how decoding works at a conceptual level and show how to implement in ERPLAB Toolbox. The webinar will begin at 9:00 AM Pacific Time (California), 12:00 PM Eastern Time (New York), 5:00 PM British Summer Time (London), 6:00 PM Central European Summer Time (Berlin). </p><p class=\"\">The webinar is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"https://erpinfo.org/the-erp-boot-camp\">ERP Boot Camp</a> and the <a href=\"https://sprweb.org\">Society for Psychophysiological Research</a>.

If your filters are too weak to attenuate the noise in your data, your effects may not be statistically significant. If your filters are too strong, they may create artifactual peaks that lead you to draw bogus conclusions.</p><p class=\"\">For years, I have been recommending a bandpass of 0.1\u201330 Hz for most cognitive and affective research in neurotypical young adults. In this kind of research, I have found that filtering from 0.1\u201330 Hz usually does a good job of minimizing noise while creating minimal waveform distortion. </p><p class=\"\">However, this recommendation was based on a combination of informal observations from many experimental paradigms and a careful examination of a couple paradigms, so it was a bit hand-wavy. In addition, the optimal filter settings will depend on the waveshape of the ERP effects and the nature of the noise in a given study, so I couldn\u2019t make any specific recommendations about other experimental paradigms and participant populations. Moreover, different filter settings may be optimal for different scoring methods (e.g., mean amplitude vs. peak amplitude vs. peak latency).</p><p class=\"\">Guanghui Zhang, David Garrett, and I spent the last year focusing on this issue. First we developed a general method that can be used to determine the optimal filter settings for a given dataset and scoring method (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14531\"><span>this paper</span></a>). Then we applied this method to the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117465\"><span>ERP CORE</span></a> data to determine the optimal filter settings for the N170, MMN, P3b, N400, N2pc, LRP, and ERN components in neurotypical young adults (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/psyp.14530\"><span>this paper</span></a> and the table above).</p><p class=\"\">If you are doing research with these components (or similar components) in neurotypical young adults, you can simply use the filter settings that we identified. If you are using a very different paradigm or testing a very different subject population, you can apply our method to your own data to find the optimal settings. We added some new tools to <a href=\"https://github.com/ucdavis/erplab\"><span>ERPLAB Toolbox</span></a> to make this easier.</p><p class=\"\">One thing that we discovered was that our old recommendation of 0.1\u201330 Hz does a good job of avoiding filter artifacts but is overly conservative for some components. For example, we can raise the low end to 0.5 Hz when measuring N2pc and MMN amplitudes, which gets rid of more noise without producing problematic waveform distortions. And we can go all the way up to 0.9 Hz for the N170 component. However, later/slower components like P3b and N400 require lower cutoffs (no higher than 0.2 Hz).</p><p class=\"\">You might be wondering how we defined the \u201coptimal\u201d filter settings. At one level, the answer is simple: The optimal filter is the one that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio without producing too much waveform distortion. The complexities arise in quantifying the signal-to-noise ratio, quantifying the waveform distortion, and deciding how much waveform distortion is \u201ctoo much\u201d. We believe we have found reasonably straightforward and practical solutions to these problems, which you can read about in the published papers.</p>",

      "content": "Objective: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. Methods: We propose to use the a priori knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC in vivo in 5 mouse brains. Results: We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\\mu$m to 18.3 $\\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction. Conclusion: We showed that IPAC can perform skull-induced aberration correction and improved power Doppler as well as ULM images acquired on the mouse brain. Significance: This technique is promising for more reliable transcranial imaging of the brain vasculature with potential non-invasive clinical applications.",

      "content": "While machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to detection and prediction tasks in clinical data, most methods rely on high-resolution data, which is not routinely available in most Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and perform poorly when faced with class imbalance. Here, we introduce and validate Collaborative Learning and Inference (CLaI) for detection and prediction of events from learned latent representations of multivariate physiological time series, leveraging similarities across patients. Our method offers a new way to detect and predict events using low-resolution physiological time series. We evaluate its performance on predicting intracranial hypertension and sepsis using the KidsBrainIT (minute-by-minute resolution) and MIMIC-IV (hourly resolution) datasets, respectively, comparing our approach with classification-based and sequence-to-sequence benchmarks from existing studies. Additional experiments on sepsis detection, robustness to class imbalance, and generalizability\u2014demonstrated via seizure detection using the CHB-MIT scalp electroencephalogram dataset\u2014confirm that CLaI effectively handles class imbalance, consistently achieving competitive performance and the highest F1 score. Overall, our approach introduces a novel method for analyzing routinely collected ICU physiological time series by leveraging patient similarity thus enabling ML interpretability through case-based reasoning.",

      "title": "Perceptual Decoupling Underlies Internal Shielding Benefit during Switches between External and Internal Attention: Evidence from Early Sensory Event-related Potential Components",
      "content": "People need to often switch attention between external and internal sources of information, that is, external and internal attention, respectively. There has been a recent surge of research interest in this type of attentional flexibility, which has revealed that it is characterized by an asymmetrical cost, being larger for switching toward internal than external attention. This cost asymmetry has been explained in terms of an internal shielding benefit, that is, the maintenance of stable internal attention against external interference. Although it is currently unclear how internal information might be shielded from external input during switches, a likely candidate is perceptual decoupling. In this study, we instructed participants to repeat external or internal attention, or to switch between them from trial to trial, while simultaneously recording 64-channel EEG. At the behavioral level, we replicated the switch cost asymmetry. Our ERP analysis provided evidence for three different processing stages. First, participants prepared more strongly for an upcoming internal than external attentional selection, as reflected in the increased contingent negative variation component. Second, during internal trials, participants moreover showed a blunted sensory response, most notable in the P1 and N1 components, reflecting perceptual decoupling. Finally, we found an increased P2 component when switching toward internal attention compared with repeating it, indicating more stable perceptual decoupling on internal repetition trials, in line with an internal shielding benefit. We integrate these findings here with behavioral accounts of the cost asymmetry and conclude that perceptual decoupling provides a potential mechanism for the internal shielding benefit of attention.",

The present study investigated the role of lexical and focus functions of prosody in the coherent interpretation of linguistic input. To this end, we manipulated the correctness of prosodic markers in the context and scrutinized how listeners evaluate these violations\u2014whether they result in lexical or focus anomalies\u2014using psychometric and EEG measures. Psychometric data from 40 participants indicated that prosodic violations were judged as incorrect by the listeners both at the lexical and focus levels, with focus level violations leading to lower correctness scores than lexical level violations, and combined violations receiving the lowest scores. EEG data from 20 participants documented a strong N400 effect (350\u2013550 msec) in response to combined violations, and a late posterior negativity (600\u2013900 msec) present only for combined violations and focus-level violations. Consistent with the psychometric data, the EEG data suggest that prosodic violations at the focus level result in higher costs for comprehension than prosodic violations at the lexical level, whereas combined prosodic violations most significantly disrupt the interpretation. Taken together, these findings suggest that the language comprehension system is sensitive to accurate representations of both lexical and information structure prosody, and benefits from the interaction between them; however, they are weighted differently based on their relevance for a functioning spoken communication.",

      "content": "The perception of multilayered auditory stimuli, such as music or speech, relies on the integration of progressively more complex and abstract features as they are processed along the auditory pathway. To investigate whether higher-level musical structure modulates auditory perception or merely the interpretation of perceived information, we examined the interaction between sound location\u2014a low-level feature\u2014and musical phrases, which are structures spanning across seconds and require temporal integration of information within continuous stimuli. This was to observe whether musical phrase boundaries modulate pre-attentive and explicit sensitivity to the location changes. Participants listened to melodies with randomized location changes and either actively reported detection of change or passively listened while EEG data were collected. Analysis of mismatch negativity responses revealed significantly larger amplitudes for location changes occurring at phrase boundaries, suggesting that musical grouping enhances the perceptual salience of these changes, conveyed by physically identical cues. Behaviorally, participants showed no difference in sensitivity but were more likely to report location changes at phrase boundaries, even when no change occurred. These findings demonstrate that higher-level musical structure modulates pre-attentive auditory processing and influences perception of spatial location. This effect appears to rely on fundamental auditory mechanisms rather than musical expertise, highlighting the dynamic interaction between abstract musical structure and low-level sensory processing.",

This study investigated the role of estradiol (E2) in regulating sleep-wake behavior in female rats and identified the brain regions involved. Methods: Using an exogenous E2 replacement model in ovariectomized rats, we assessed changes in sleep-wake patterns via EEG/EMG telemetry. The effects of E2 and progesterone, selective estrogen receptor agonists, and direct brain infusions of E2 and receptor antagonists were evaluated. Results: E2 administration increased wakefulness, reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and decreased NREM slow-wave activity (SWA), predominantly during the dark phase. These effects required both estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and beta (ER{beta}) activation and were mediated by estrogen receptor signaling within the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). Direct infusion of E2 into the MnPO was sufficient to replicate systemic effects, while local infusion of the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant) attenuated them. Progesterone did not augment estradiol actions, and males showed no sleep-wake changes in response to E2, highlighting sex-specific mechanisms.",

      "content": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons provide precisely timed, context-dependent inhibition within cortical circuits. PV neuron firing properties are specialized among cortical neurons, suggesting that they express a unique complement of ion channels. Here, we identify the PV-specific silent voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunit Kv6.4 (encoded by Kcng4) as a modulator of both intrinsic and synaptic properties. Kv6.4 does not form functional channels on its own but assembles with Kv2 subunits to create heterotetrameric channel complexes. Kcng4 expression is enriched within a distinct Pvalb-expressing subclass in primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex and emerges during postnatal development. Kv6.4 depolarizes the interspike and threshold potentials, broadens action potentials (APs), increases AP height, and decelerates the AP upstroke. These changes in AP waveform enhance GABA release probability and paired-pulse depression at synapses made by PV onto pyramidal (PYR) neurons. The effects of Kv6.4 loss are amplified during high-frequency firing, within the physiological range of fast-spiking PV neurons, likely due to altered repolarization dynamics that accumulate across successive APs. These findings are thus consistent with the function of Kv6.4 in modifying Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier currents. Hence, Kv6.4 tunes the temporal precision of PV inhibitory output, a feature that may be critical for stable excitation-inhibition ratios and adaptive circuit function underlying learning and behavior.",

Functional assays to establish pathogenicity of human variants is a key limiting factor in the clinical interpretation of genetic findings. Methods based on radioactive [3H]-GABA uptake come with significant regulatory concerns, cost, and workflow complexity, which could be resolved by an alternate assay. To address this issue, we developed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay of GAT-1-mediated GABA uptake using a genetically encoded GABA sensor, iGABA-Snfr. We demonstrated that pathogenic variants strongly reduced uptake (mean, -89.4% [95% CI, -71.5% to -107.3%]). Some variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were associated with reduced GABA uptake (G111R, S459R, V511M; mean, -101.2% [95% CI -81.1% to -121.3%]), whereas others showed only mild reduction (R211C, R566H, F242V, R419C; mean, -33.6% [95% CI -17.2% to -50.1%]), supporting variant reclassification. Variant-specific effects on iGABA were highly correlated with the results of the radioactive [3H]-GABA assay (R2=0.8095, p<0.0001). The molecular chaperone 4-phenylbutyric acid (4PBA) was associated with ~35% increase in iGABA. This non-radioactive assay is suitable for functional validation and high-throughput screening to identify positive modulators of GAT-1.",

      "title": "Complex environmental cycles reveal evolution of circadian activity waveform and thermosensitive timeless splicing",
      "content": "Circadian clocks synchronise physiological and behavioural rhythms to environmental cycles such as light and temperature. In nature, temperature cycles lag light cycles, with the extent of lag varying seasonally. Thus, the extent of this delay is an essential aspect of seasonal cues. Yet, the combined effects of light and temperature cycles on circadian systems remain poorly understood. Using a series of environmental cycles with varying degrees of lag between temperature and light, we examined the response of circadian activity to complex environments and show that morning and evening activity exhibit differential temperature sensitivity in Drosophila melanogaster. We find that the expression of temperature-induced timeless splice variants is modulated by light cycles as well as the degree of lag between temperature and light. We also reveal rhythmic expression of the timeless splicing regulator Psi. Furthermore, we leveraged a laboratory-selection approach to reveal that the differential temperature sensitivity of morning and evening activity evolves upon selection. We observed selection-dependent differences in temporal expression of timeless splice variants thus linking circadian gene splicing to behavioural plasticity. Thus, our integrated behavioural, molecular, and evolutionary approach advances the understanding of how circadian systems integrate seasonal cues.",

      "title": "Offline Reconstruction of Diffusion MRI Acquisitions for Comparison Between Complex PCA-based and AI-based Denoising",
      "content": "Purpose: Optimal diffusion MRI (dMRI) reconstruction for image denoising is often unavailable from scanner reconstruction. In this work we make available an offline reconstruction pipeline for GE dMRI acquisitions, giving access to complex, unfiltered dMRI data. Furthermore, we compare the efficacy of GE HealthCare's AIR-Recon DLTM (ARDL), a proprietary convolutional neural network-based reconstruction and denoising approach, to open-source patch-based MPPCA and NORDIC denoising methods on high-resolution dMRI data. Methods: We developed an end-to-end offline dMRI reconstruction pipeline for GE HealthCare acquisitions, building on and augmenting the Orchestra software development kit and validated its output against scanner reconstruction. We used it to compare MPPCA, NORDIC and ARDL denoising approaches, considering underlying metrics reflecting noise variance and noise floor suppression, such as the signal dynamic range and ADC in highly anisotropic areas, noise variance in maximally-suppressed dMRI signal and downstream measurements, such as fibre orientation estimation and white matter tractography. Results: Our validated offline reconstruction starts from single-channel complex k-space data and allows channel combination, support of various in-plane/out-of-plane accelerations and partial Fourier reconstruction methods and retrospectively switching filters off. Unlike scanner reconstruction, our pipeline provides access to complex dMRI data, allowing denoising in the complex domain, which showed superior noise floor suppression compared to magnitude constrained denoising. Comparisons across denoising methods suggest improved spatial resolution, contrast-to-noise and more robust fibre orientation estimation when using patch-based approaches compared to ARDL. Conclusion: We found significant gains in dMRI data quality when using the proposed offline reconstruction pipeline, allowing denoising to occur in the complex domain, both for reducing noise-induced variance and bias. MPPCA and NORDIC (4D patch based) outperformed ARDL (2D) in terms of spatial resolution, reduction of noise-floor bias and variance.",
