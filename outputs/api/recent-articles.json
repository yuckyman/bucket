      "title": "Dysregulated Microglial Synaptic Engulfment in Diffuse Midline Glioma",
      "content": "Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a near-universally lethal form of pediatric high-grade glioma, driven by neuronal activity-regulated paracrine signaling and synaptic integration of malignant cells into neural circuits. In turn, DMG increases neuronal excitability, augmenting neuron-to-glioma signaling. In the healthy brain, microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), regulate neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity. However, the role of microglia in promoting tumor-associated hyperexcitable neural networks in glioma remains unknown. Here, we investigate the activity-regulated engulfment of neuronal synapses by microglia in both healthy and glioma-bearing mice, and further explore how glioma cells alter microglia-mediated circuit refinement, contributing to pathogenic neuronal hyperexcitability. Microglia-mediated circuit refinement in the glioma microenvironment was characterized through synaptic engulfment analysis of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses by microglia in healthy mice and patient-derived DMG xenograft models, paired with optogenetic stimulation in the neocortex. We found that glutamatergic neuronal activity in the healthy brain increased excitatory synaptic engulfment by microglia in a previously unappreciated negative feedback mechanism that may guard against hyperexcitability. In contrast, this activity-regulated increase in excitatory synaptic engulfment was abrogated in DMG-infiltrated brains. Instead, inhibitory synaptic engulfment was significantly increased in DMG in response to glutamatergic neuronal activity. Together, these dysregulated synaptic engulfment mechanisms may create imbalance in the excitatory to inhibitory (E:I) synapse ratio predicted to increase neuronal excitability. Complementary single-nuclei sequencing studies revealed concordant tumor-specific, activity-regulated changes in microglia-neuron signaling showing reduced expression of excitatory synaptic refinement gene programs in microglia, potentially mediating the aberrant synaptic engulfment observed in DMG. These findings reveal novel cancer-neuron-immune interactions in DMG and provide an opportunity to potentially modulate tumor-associated neuronal hyperexcitability by targeting aberrant microglial synaptic engulfment.",

      "title": "Longitudinal Resting-State fMRI of Awake Mice During Habituation: Stress, Head Motion, and Functional Connectivity",
      "content": "Awake mouse fMRI is a powerful tool for both neuroscience and translational research. To minimize head motion during scanning, habituation under physical restraint is commonly used. However, it remains unclear how stress levels and head motion evolve during habituation, particularly within the MRI environment. To address this, we repeatedly measured plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels in three groups of mice - controls, mice habituated outside the MRI magnet, and mice habituated within the fMRI environment - and acquired longitudinal resting-state fMRI data daily during an eight-day habituation period and again 15 days post-habituation at 15.2 T. We found that CORT levels initially increased by approximately twofold and gradually decreased during habituation outside the magnet, whereas in mice habituated within the fMRI environment, CORT levels increased two- to fourfold and remained elevated throughout the habituation period. One week after habituation, CORT levels returned to baseline in both groups. Throughout all resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, head motion and functional connectivity remained stable, likely due to the well-designed restraint cradle that permitted paw movement. These results suggest that additional habituation days do not further reduce stress, provided that head motion remains within acceptable limits.",

      "title": "Environmental Conflict Modulates Pavlovian Bias",
      "content": "Pavlovian avoidance enables rapid defensive responding but can undermine goal directed behaviour when it overrides instrumental control, a tendency amplified in anxiety. Whether such biases can be flexibly and rapidly modulated by environmental structure remains unknown. Here we show that global conflict in the environment can suppress Pavlovian avoidance and enhance instrumental choice, particularly in individuals high in trait anxiety. One hundred and sixteen participants completed a sequential approach avoidance task in which three options differed in reward-punishment conflict, and blocks varied the frequency of high conflict encounters. In low conflict environments, participants exhibited pronounced and misplaced avoidance of objectively safe, no conflict options indicating that choices are not determined by local contingencies alone but are tuned to broader environmental context. Interestingly, increasing environmental conflict reduced this maladaptive avoidance: approach to safe options increased, and reinforcement learning and drift diffusion modelling revealed higher reward sensitivity and drift rates alongside reduced lapse and Pavlovian bias parameters. These effects were strongest in high anxious individuals, whose behaviour shifted markedly toward that of low anxious peers. Crucially, benefits depended on the frequency of conflict encounters and were not elicited by cue outcome reversals or increased punishment probability alone. Furthermore, a modified Go/NoGo task replicated global conflict dependent improvements on Pavlovian incongruent trials. Together, these results demonstrate that global environmental conflict can rapidly recalibrate the balance between Pavlovian and instrumental systems, attenuating maladaptive avoidance and disproportionately aiding anxious individuals. We propose that conflict driven arousal dynamics, plausibly mediated by LC-NE mechanisms, promote this adaptive reconfiguration of defensive and goal directed control.",

      "title": "Image-Based Profiling of Induced Trophoblast Stem Cells Identifies Signatures Associated with Sex, Schizophrenia Genomic Risk and Placental Stress",
      "content": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a neurodevelopmental disorder where both genetic and environmental risks converge during pregnancy. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of placental biology in influencing risk of developing SCZ. However, the pathways by which genetic risk factors for SCZ interact with environmental influences to alter placental development are poorly understood. Through image-based profiling using Cell Painting, we leveraged trophoblast cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from male and female SCZ and neurotypical donors with varying placental genomic risk scores (PlacGRS) to explore the developmental dynamics of placental cells under normal growth and hypoxic stress. We employed both classical (e.g., CellProfiler) and deep learning feature extraction combined with downstream supervised machine learning to analyze high-dimensional data obtained from this hiPSC-derived model system, highlighting that these approaches overcome the inherent line-to-line variability in phenotypic analysis. Our findings reveal a salient nucleus-localized SCZ risk signature across cell lines, along with clear sexual dimorphism. This research underscores the capability of hiPSC-derived placenta models to elucidate complex interactions between genetic risk and environmental factors implicated in the neurodevelopment of SCZ, paving the way for future studies aimed at developing targeted therapeutic and prevention strategies.",

      "content": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex (ALS/PDC) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that was once hyperendemic in the island of Guam (Mariana Islands, US) and a few other Pacific locales. Despite extensive investigations into its origins, the etiology of ALS/PDC remains unclear. ALS/PDC is, at the neuropathology level, characterized by tau-dominant multiple proteinopathy in brain and spinal cord. It was recently reported that Guam ALS/PDC brain extracts exhibit tau seeding activity in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor cells. To build upon those findings and explore the nature of tau seeds in ALS/PDC in more detail, we used an alanine mutational scanning (Ala scan) approach to determine the seeding profile of tau in nervous tissues of Guam ALS/PDC cases. First, we confirmed the detection of tau seeding activity in ALS/PDC brain samples in tau biosensor cells. Notably, we could also detect potent tau seeding activity in spinal cord. Subsequent Ala scan assays demonstrated that ALS/PDC tau displays an aggregate incorporation pattern that resembles that of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-type tau. This result is consistent with recent electron cryo-microscopy studies of tau, which revealed that ALS/PDC tau filaments are predominantly of the CTE-type. The structural characteristics and seeding behavior of ALS/PDC tau, as well as the regional distribution of tau pathology at post-mortem, suggest that ALS/PDC is a CTE-like tauopathy.",

      "title": "The organization of visual pathways in the Drosophila brain",
      "content": "Visual systems across species transform photoreceptor inputs into diverse perceptual representations through hierarchical networks that extract features via parallel pathways. In Drosophila, the optic lobes are layered, retinotopic visual processing centers that contain two-thirds of the brain's neurons and support diverse visually guided behaviors. Although this architecture has long suggested hierarchical and parallel organization, a system-wide account of how behaviorally relevant visual features are routed and integrated across a complete visual system--in any animal--has remained elusive. The new male fly connectome now provides the synapse-level wiring needed to trace visual information from photoreceptors through the optic lobes and across the central brain. Applying a network-based analysis of information flow, we reveal a multi-layered architecture organized into distinct, functionally interpretable pathways. Using this framework to propagate signals through these pathways predicts receptive-field structure and feature selectivity consistent with physiological data, enabling large-scale functional annotation of thousands of neuron types. We find that distinct visual input channels are broadly distributed throughout the brain, yet converge in focal regions of feature specificity and acute spatial vision. Together, these analyses provide a neuron-level, connectome-based view of how a brain organizes and transforms visual input.",

      "title": "Human and AI voice identities evoke shared neural signatures during speaker recognition across changes in speech content and prosody",
      "content": "Both biologically-produced human voices and algorithmically-generated AI speech manifest speaker identity. Critically, prosodic variations modulate the acoustic dimensions (e.g., fundamental frequency) that also shape individual speaker identity representations. So far it remains unclear whether listeners process speaker identities in human and AI voices through neurologically equivalent mechanisms, nor how prosodic cues might influence these cognitive processes. We examined event-related potentials during old/new speaker discrimination after name-based identity learning, and further analyzed correctly recognized old speakers comparing trials where prosody matched vs. mismatched between learning and testing. For old/new discrimination, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed three significant late windows (662-1498 ms) with Pz as the primary contributor for AI voices, yet none for human voices. Univariate analyses revealed that human voices showed earlier widespread discrimination (N250: 200-280 ms), while both voice types converged on Pz as the strongest contributor based on effect size rankings for late old/new effects (400-800 ms). These old/new effects emerged across completely different speech content between learning and testing, addressing a gap in prior literature. For speaker-specific prosodic expectation effects in the 500-900 ms window, unexpected prosody elicited late positivity for human voices compared to the prosody used during learning, whereas AI voices elicited late negativity. The late positivity resembles P600 components observed for communicative style expectancy violations, while the late negativity likely reflects effortful reprocessing of prosodic violations within atypical synthetic signals, analogous to accented speech processing. Our study advances understanding of voice identity in cognitive neuroscience and offers implications for AI voices in human-computer interaction.",
